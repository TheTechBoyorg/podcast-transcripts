<h1>Good Night And God Bless 101 Subscribers</h1>
<pre>hello everybody as you can see from your

if you got the joke in the title
congratulations UNL a down Gideon Lane
official Super Fan so today's title of
the episode is called good night and God
bless the name of that probably don't
get it main episode that kind of ended
the series but we have lots of things to
talk to you guys about like one I got my
extreme skin from extreme skins and I'm
going to be talking about that and
phone on day two
um we recently got to the 100th
subscriber so thank you to everyone
who's on not the big who was on
everything just thank you to have all
the fans out there who have helped me
get to where I am now thank you guys
some more later and right after this
goes live we are going to post a brand
new article about
have blemishes from your face using
Samsung's photo editor and then
[Music]
um
maybe Monday there might be an article
about how to do some special effect in
your gallery photo editor
um from Samsung Galaxy but let's get to
what you're really here for and that is
the celebration of our 101st subscriber
all right here we go one YouTube
as you can see here we have 101
subscribers
subscribe to a little of the best of
thing but first I'd like to thank you
guys for watching and subscribing and
following me and also I'd like to thank
God for helping me for blessing the
channel and the website and for helping
and contribute just
this is great
so just thank everyone
for
its growth and
thank you for the
60 yeah but over 60 50 hits a day on the
website and you're still going to be us
we're still going to
um produce this type of content we're
still going to have our Salvation
message on the tech boy and now inside
the videos but condensed we're still
going to put Bible verses inside the
channel description
um video descriptions we're still going
to do what made us positive to begin
with and speaking of what made us
probably to begin with we
you know
discounted Tick Tock three times and
that's been a great content because it
seems like I'm the youngest one actually
watching the videos and it seems like
most people watching these videos are a
bit older than me so these videos have
been before one of my most hopeful
videos even though it didn't get as much
tracks and would be the Google Lens
video people who just don't know
um what Google lens is and why it's so
important
um but also we'll
video because apparently
people don't keep the content going also
people also like my reaction to me not
knowing gen Z terms which is now the
number two video on the channel and then
so wow wow so we have the bull Choice
blade speak a boxing with 204 views that
was six months ago it was like one of my
first decently edited videos
uh and then we have two video videos
right here so I guess you guys think the
content so we'll keep the content going
um but I have a very special video
coming up for you guys soon Andrew's in
Genesis has released a video about chat
GPT being detrimental to Christianity so
you know I'm going to react to that is a
30 minute video so I may or may not clip
it but we'll see about that and then of
course we have the Juan Carlos Bagnell
interview and then my favorite device
I've ever tested one of the most
favorite ones whereas the planet
computers Cosmo communicator and maybe
you'll hear from peppermint mobile again
who knows right I mean apparently mobile
is on profit for the anti-trex videos
content creation so guys if you wanted
to
please tell me the only reason this is
here because we use everything on our
phone tests in anyway
but watching subscribe
big things are coming ahead of us we
have more content than ever coming out
don't be able to see me in more places
coming coming soon and actually starting
now and even one of my most helpful
videos it only took a few seconds to
make was how to change 24 version 1 to
2002 in the voice changer which I can't
even be able to get the voices to work
but I did get this to work so thank you
everyone who wants to be number 90 on
that video all right thank you one for
these
101 subscribers Julie it's been a
pleasure doing this and I will keep
doing this for you guys all right now
let's talk about the extreme skins case
uh skin that I received from
um here and then we'll talk about the
Verge again and then
I guess that's it so I can go write my
article so first the extreme skin is
right here it is on the Samsung Galaxy
s22 plus it was supposed to be
customized inside the tech boy but it
doesn't but that's okay it still is nice
it does have a little hole right here so
you can see the Samsung
trade logo thing right there it covers
the cameras and the um you know back of
the phone not the original of the phone
installation is really easy they have a
YouTube video but here it is look it's
really easy short use alcohol wipes the
swab on there and then stick you and
stick it right here onto the back of the
phone it's just that easy that simple
okay but if you do need help there is a
QR code here which you can scan with
Google end all your Samsung camera app
and it will take you right to their
YouTube page on their specific phone
all right so
um I've only been using this for two
days but I'm gonna give some criticisms
and some good things about it first of
all I mean it is sticky it's not peeling
off but you can stick and we stick it
off um if you need to like adjust it or
anything like that
um it fits the phone well okay don't
need to use BUMP suit because I think I
just maybe some dust under there
um and the Finish is nice
I don't know what it's supposed to be
wood maybe the only criticism I have of
this right now
um I don't know about women too because
it's only been two days
um I received it yesterday
um the only Christmas wherever right now
is that the grain is all going this way
this way or a pad went if you go down
and across down the massage Down the
Cross which would just make it better
for grip because it can just kind of
slip out of your hand but I guess it is
not as sticky as the back of the phone
but I mean the back wasn't that slippery
I think it was frosted glass
um and also this doesn't really offer
any real product detection I mean this
is probably more likely to get scratched
than the actual glass of the focus is
running really grass victus but I mean
it's a nice aesthetic it makes fun to
look kind of look like silver wood
uh yeah kind of like Silvers but it has
a wood grain texture in it it's really
nice I'm not sure about the price though
um 31 Euros I mean pounds let me see
about that um
37
for the thing I think that's what it was
without shipping because they come all
the way from the UK it's about forty
dollars for skin but I mean I would say
this is a good alternative a good
upstart to dbrand which
um like the brand I
first of all they don't
they're just so robotic and mean to the
consumers and like one time I was like
hey guys I would like to um work with
you but you have all this bad language
on your page and like
yeah anyway
um the next thing on the agenda is now
to talk about the one post that we have
up right now later we'll talk about the
uh
pin post and then I need to go back and
watch last week's episode to see what I
said it right about soon but oh well you
can just tell me you could do that okay
anyway Dex on PC is great but
so ducks on PC is this software program
developed by Samsung it's called Dex and
you just plug your phone into your
computer and
your phone screen on the computer and
that's really good editing and
applications like lima Fusion because
actually normal Fusion is probably a lot
faster than the program I also use
Chrome video Studio Pro 2022 at least on
this computer because I don't think it
has a GPU just integrated anyway
um
so I was editing a clip on there for
project
um this project I posted about
um I'll link it down here and
um everything the washing clip and it
did some did well but
the screen gets a bit dim for some
reason it wasn't recognizing my USBC
input or there's one from a little Wi-Fi
which is nice but I mean if you're not
on Wi-Fi it's not gonna do anything I
wonder if it worked with the hotspot
that's interesting and I'm not sure if
the files are supposed to drag and drop
the weight like I couldn't get them to
drag and drop in but that's all fine
whatever
um Dragon drop them from the Explorer 2
decks so to transform the files that way
but the excellent PC is great it gives
you your PC a new light let's say you
have say a 300 PC not a Chromebook but
it's running Windows and it's really
slow four gigs of RAM 64 gigabytes of
storage we do have this I don't know
older Galaxy S10 s20
128 gigabytes destroyed six eight gigs
of RAM something like that pretty decent
camera
um you could do over the Wi-Fi network
and it would use the processing power
off the phone which is probably more
powerful than the computer you can do
um basic photo edits with
um photo Google photos which is awful
because like that but you had a photo
editing applications out there as well
you can do some web browsing or you can
do some I mean there was a bit of Mac
maybe you could lose Wi-Fi it's a video
editing get pneuma Fusion it was really
nice it's basically turned your laptop
into a portable monitor for your phone
the only criticism I have is against it
instead of getting really recognize
input and it asked for the phone to have
to go over Wi-Fi and the screen was
demoed in the actual screen so when I
was trans switching back from my laptop
to Dex I had to have to brightness up
but when it was here it was super bright
Because the actual brightness so I don't
know what that's about maybe Samsung
will fix it in a little update but I
really hope that Samsung keeps pushing
Bixby keeps pushing decks because that's
really good really productive moving
Celtics or Bixby doesn't look like
bixby's going away they introduced some
voice cloning tools for your Bixby text
call feature which is an interesting
feature
um so that's great so anyway thank you
for subscribing please subscribe to this
video and that's all for now Tech talk
to you later good night and God bless</pre>
