<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 6824</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech booy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
the this weekend The Tech booy podcast
and welcome um to everyone who's
watching back here so we are live
streaming from our uh uh computer today
not from the phone unfortunately we
could not get our deck set up to work
for live streams correctly yet um that
setup is powered by the Galaxy s24 Ultra
um the lsky um USBC monitor uh
touchcreen and then these open Easter
Bluetooth headphones now um as you guys
can see here we got this battery case
for the phone they finally sent over the
correct one this is from new DA battery
um $50 10,000 mamps an hour just got it
today um it fits a lot better than the
one they sent over last time so that is
good because they sent over the one for
s23 Ultra instead s24 last time
accidentally and that is
unfortunate now as you guys may remember
on that fateful day of August I mean
sorry April 30th
2024 uh official Tech boy account was
kicked off of NB due to age restrictions
and liabilities and stuff like that well
I'm pleased to announce that in
collaboration with mind networks the
people make the minds.com
network um we have launched our own NTV
two months after we said we were working
on it here at the techboy media we like
to keep our promises and we have kept
our
promise so just head over to site. the
techboy I mean social. techboy or or
notthe
boy.com
um and it is your very own prot
te Pro uh Christian social media
website notthe
boy.com behold the most
beautiful powerful social media Network
on planet Earth not the boy so congratul
ations we accomplished it we promised
you guys that we were going to build
this for you and we did notthe
boy.com here it is and speaking of
social media and influencers let's be
sure to get AA harop up to 300 by the
end of tonight's episode as you guys
know AA Hopper is our
um digital influencer hopefully you can
see your on
screen um when of the things that we
weren't able to get on with the Samsung
Galaxy s24 Ultra on Dex yet it's the
screen sharing abilities um
unfortunately Andro Nix and all the
little TX and Linux guis so right now we
have 260 followers and 171 posts by the
end of this I want 300 followers okay um
so unfortunately we we were able to get
sharing screen ability on like some of
the desktop browsers and Andrew Nix some
of the TX GIS unfortunately those Gris
are broken but like they'll crash out
after 10 minutes especially andronix and
the problems is that the Samsung Galaxy
s24 Ultra is too powerful for its own
good um it has a Snapdragon agent 3 chip
right unfortunately wi later uh does not
support the Snapdragon agent 3 chip yet
it only goes up to H and two and
vector's VM those awful terrible good
for nothing people um not good for
nothing but like awful terrible evil
people whove run to sight uh have still
not updated drivers to support Vector VM
uh to support the Snapdragon H gen 3 yet
okay now in AI developments commentator
Matt wal do of course come out against
uh uh dead people AI of course because
you know that's his job you know if he
has AI in the name uh he's against it
which is kind of sad because if the
people consent to it and the the L ons
want to do it I think that they should
be able to um have that techn techy
available today but um it's too late to
be reacting to stuff right now we got to
speed do stuff so uh headlines from
today all right so we talked about
Manifest Destiny Manifest Destiny being
that Samsung Dex needs to get onto every
device uh Samsung device as quickly as
possible according to statistics from
versus.com which is a website that be
toie on where you can compare devices
with each other um the Samsung Galaxy
a54 which is
Samsung's mid-range phone right now so
for about $450 on T-Mobile about $200 on
Amazon um because the a55 hasn't come to
us a US Centric site um and man ifest
Destiny was a US Centric thing
um is 10% faster than the Samsung Galaxy
S8 and S8 plus phones
um in the following seven years uh
Samsung Dex has appeared on all Samsung
S phones and all zold phones and only on
one Galaxy a phone the Galaxy A90 um
which I don't believe came to the United
States of America um now Samsung's
budget phone uh mid-range budget phone
the Galaxy a54 is 10% faster than that
and has two times more RAM than the
Galaxy S8 so this shows that the a54
could run Dex if it wanted to now it
does not have the same type of USB port
than those phones I I don't think it
supported video out which I do not
believe the new DA cases so when I'm
using this phone at home I'm going to
have to take the case out so that I can
use my monitor because I have not used
this computer in a long time uh uh a lot
this week
because
um I decided to use my phone as a
computer with the laptop which I will be
getting to
um I'm just checking to see if we have
an ENT thing going on here
all right um yeah
so yeah so that is what this is I'm
saying that Dex should come to other
devices but Dex also has another problem
which I need to get to um in the part
two of that series um I believe the
problem
was oh yeah it just needs something
added to it uh it it needs a desktop
browser at least um for instance you
can't do control shift eye on it you
can't do
um you can't do uh you can't do the
inspect tools on decks um there's no
desktop operating system they took Linux
on decks away back in 2020 um with
Android 10 um so it just it just needs
something more to it I like I'm enjoying
it right but Samsung internet is limited
to 99 tabs Chrome is having some glitch
glitches just a little bit of glitches
speaking of glitches this Samsung Galaxy
software experience hasn't been as
smooth as I thought it would be no it is
good I like the phone but um for
instance um
the I mean it's been very smooth it's
been fast the camera is launching well
but I just didn't expect that the app
switcher to be stuttery uh sometimes and
like I guess the software could just be
a little better and the GPS accuracy um
is a bit weird like it's not bad about
uh within 3 m or 9 ft uh in Imperial
unit
Freedom Units um about 9t but my new
phone which is for sale on eBay go check
out AAL Hoppers no that's my new phone
which is for sale on eBay and ail haror
will be getting that link soon shortly
uh this a still for sale brand new um
got one within one meter in F or five
feet um depending on what how you
switched it of GPS accuracy so that is
very good so within 5T of GPS accuracy
is really good um another thing about
phone and speaking
of I'm also selling the Galaxy S uh 22
Plus in the original box um and with my
extreme skin added onto it so also check
that out it is on Ava har link tree um
the top link and then that will take you
to my eBay store so everyone just go
visit link tree.
UHD all right um speaking of brightness
also on this phone has been really good
but in the hot Houston Sun uh Sun um
full brightness um especially with all
the you know swiping that you do on the
screen with the s pin and stuff you can
kind of start to see smudes um appear on
the screen when it's in like super
direct sunlight um but and when it's not
in super direct sunlight it's fine also
it can be kind of hard to see darker
things like uh Dark Shadows and movies
like this room is kind of dark so if I
was to watch this video outside
in the hot Houston sun beaming down
um it
would it would I'd have a hard time
seeing the darker parts of this um video
however for maps I would switch to light
mode for that because it is kind of hard
to see the Google Maps in dark mode
So speaking of AA harer I thought that
we should ramp up production
of of AA Haru so I guess this is going
to be a little tutorial on how
artificial intelligence generated
influencers work um for you guys if you
guys would like that tutorial so let me
just log in so we can share with
everybody and then we will be having our
AI
um AI
influencer course so here you go the Ava
Harper was created a few months ago
um and unfortunately you do have to use
the application to add all of these
things here like this and this and this
and the application that we've been
using most to to um uh generate images
nowadays is the application we talked
about last week which was the L
Trix
um the L Trix photo editing application
now you only get five generations a a
hour but that's fine because I can
uninstall and reinstall the application
however I did find this new which is
great so I am not a girl okay I have
never been one and will never be one so
I don't know what the studio audience
likes that quote for some reason
um wait wait wait oh yeah so I don't
know what all the fashion trends are and
uh Instagram gives you um unique uh
analytics and data on who the top people
in your Niche are and then you can
emulate what they're doing so um we use
Google Circle to search to Circle in and
find out what kind of clothes they're
using but sometimes Google Circle search
doesn't work especially if it has human
faces involved in it which is why we've
been using this new tool it came today
and it is amazing so all you have to do
is take a screenshot of the uh of the
person in the image wearing the clothes
whatever you want and you can change the
hardness factor of it so I do about 7
it's out of one so seven maybe to one um
and this tool is called let me check
check
uh
sorry so I first first I was thinking
maybe we should do prompt to uh photo to
prompt generation so you would put in a
photo either to gp40 which I only have a
few prompts of or this tool which is
free um I have to go check my bookmarks
it's in Samsung internet let me see oh
there it is Samsung internet is kind of
weird oh yes it's called Uh video took
that app so I'm going to take you there
um and you can upload an image and will
give you a prompt to put into to the
generation software which is either
Leonardo a AI or lyrix own AI image
generation in photo leap okay the
problem with that is that sometimes the
software gets it wrong um like uh
there's another software called po and I
can also do that or tra GPT you can also
do that but sometimes lyrix has a hard
time not LX photo leap has a hard time
of understanding um
what what what the image is um exactly I
did find that it does have a good way of
working with clothes that are on shine
shine.com um
so that's interesting I guess it knows
what those clothes are and it also knows
what
some uh certain types of food is as well
all right let's see oh video talk so no
no not two o just one so talk like Tik
Tok uh vide talk. apppp so
it has a free image prompt generator and
you can upload images into it and then
it will give you a prompt but that was
that was working okay it was working a
little bit good but we're making a big
push we want to have uh 400 followers by
the end of uh tomorrow okay so that
would be 140 extra so I need you guys to
come on and let's show AA some love all
right
um but the tool I really like I mean it
is amazing let me let me check my email
because I got a verification code for it
because you can sign up with
uh you can sign up with um your email or
your Google account and I ran out of
token so I created a separate account
okay um it is
called it'd be a real shame if I forgot
what it was called
because let me just s it's code because
they sent a code
style. a amazing tool amazing tool okay
so I want I want you guys to see what
Styler ai's work can do
um here we go now here's an image that
was generated using Styler AI I
believe I forgot okay
um oh yes here we go here we go this
image oh that's an awful caption but
okay um are based off of two images that
I found other people using now some of
the other softwares couldn't get the
shirt correct or the curve
Bend thingy but using Styler AI this is
not sponsored though I wish it was um
using ster AI it was able to correctly
emulate the the the look of the image
I'm going to log in and I'm going to
show you the original images and then
I'm going to show you how it made images
and then of course I had to use vietn to
replace the face of image now uh while
that site is loading in the background I
also want to show you that these reals
here are actually doing impressively
well um so according to the analytics
dashboard people actually like the
wheels a lot so I decid hey let's keep
making them and sinking them with songs
so uh most popular real is a uh sync to
the United States na them I don't know
why because according to analytics it's
like 12% Indian and 12% us so it's kind
of tied speaking of the United States uh
beat Pakistan 20 in a cricket game all
right um
anyway so as the styler AI is loading
back in the
background um you can oh yeah here we go
we're going to show show the tab so I
found the these people um just doing my
market research on what is good and what
isn't good um so there is what that is
the original
person and you can click this no that
text image image to image and then you
click your style
realistic and then Auto
prompt or you can write your own prompts
or you get a certain amount of tokens uh
credits when the're down below seven and
then you can change your structure match
so let's do a S so it's 7 out of one and
it's styze and it's going to generate
over there so while it's generating
let's go back to AA harer um so people
actually really liked our wheels and
they even liked this one and I found out
people liked flowing here um so this
brings us to our next thing um it's some
song that's playing in the background
okay so uh can you pause this no okay I
never said I was an expert
[Music]
um where it
go no okay it's just a picture anyway as
you can see uh see how the hearts are
coming out of her image out of her hair
and the hair is animated but she's not
that is another one of the applications
developed by the um
um photo leap uh it's called motion leap
and it's an animation tool so all you
have to do is you go into motion leap
and we'll get into whatever was on the
image there you go into motion leap and
this is really a neat trick for using
your s pin um so here's another image
I've been working on so let's just click
play now what you'll notice here is her
hair is moving but her body is not like
her face on eyes on and anything else is
not moving so you may be asking what's
going on so I'm gonna walk you through
this so you click the button on here
that says new creation and then um you
will pick your image so I have one image
saved to my regular phone and one image
lots of images saved to secure folder
because I need the stock face to work um
in my VN AI image generator so what you
go in here and then you'll click the
thing that says animate and it's really
good to use an S Pen for this if you
have it then you'll draw your path um
let's say you want to animate here so
you'll draw you zoom in and then you'll
draw your path however you
want right oh move this way see how the
lines are do but if you pess play
everything else is going to move her
face is g to move so you have two ways
to stop this you can use anchor which
wherever you anchor something it's going
to freeze stuff so I'm going to Anchor
like her cheeks her eyes and then her
shoulders because those are moving too
and then or you can use freeze which you
can just
erase uh you get this green not green
orange thing and then that will just
freeze everything in time though it can
appear more pixelated on screen and the
good thing about this is there is no uh
is not Watermark added um so I find that
to be nice and when you do that and you
just keep doing this keep adding anchor
points and you can add your paths on how
you want your hair to move and then you
can anchor the background and anchor her
face anchor her eyebrow so there a lot
of hard we going into creating an
artificial intelligence uh influencer
but once you're done you click export
and you can change the duration of the
image um you can change its ratio so you
can be 69 but you have to move so that
would be 169 and then you can like
either scroll down or whatever um or you
can make it one one so like uh I think
that's Instagram I'm not sure or for
Snapchat or something like that so
there's different ways that you can
animate your images and people like the
animated images here another thing that
I did here is as you can see here you
have the uh photo frames though those
are from Linda so Linda only allows you
to export one photo a week
unfortunately unfortunately but
uh just kind of kind of question that
anyway uh unfortunately but you can
still screenshot in it so Linda is an AI
photo editor it doesn't really generate
stuff but what you can do in here is I
did a lots of images in here it has AI
that can um detect the subject from the
background and it it can like change the
lighting condition of just the subject
or just the background or of both um so
you're able to edit one image per day
but you can still screenshot edit that
in yourself and it has these frames here
uh all the way over it's uh all the way
over to the right um and it says frames
and you can add these frames and have
like these nice picture frames and then
you can put in your folders here so um
you have frame frame frame whatever all
you can have no frame so this is the
original picture with no frame uh I
think there's a fig on it and then you
can add a frame on it and then what I
did was I uh I did this Frame right and
then there's multiple people on frame uh
multiple pictures on the frame it's like
those Instagram multi- picture thingy
Gallery I don't know what called um
things and and it's good now let's go
back over to our Stylo AI um let's pass
the key u it really wasn't that long it
just we uh talking um speaking of I
talked
about hope you can see
this I mean look here's the sorry here's
the original image this is from another
person's thing and there is a watermark
towards the bottom but you can easily
crop that out and I did not have a match
turned on so if I did it should have
this to be black but that
is basically the same just uh the face
is different but you can have it change
if you want it to and the uh notice how
the uh whatever
notice it won't let me zoom in but
notice how the um it's more wrinkled
down
there and they also added some more
lighting cu
but that is um pretty accurate pretty
accurate now I was able to find out what
that thing was called using Google
Circle to search so that was a good
thing um but I'm going to say that this
is has been the most accurate tool from
changing our images into prompts um
fortunately uh even if you run out of
Auto promps um all default prompt is
just like
uh would be like 19 as age even though
she's technically 20 um and then you put
it in there and then you describe you
have to put in the race I think if it
doesn't detect um so AA is canol
canally canonically uh White so we
always typed it into the prompts and
then you'll get that so yeah hopefully
you guys like it and will'll drive and
will drive more engagement and as AA
gets more popular um
as AA gets more popular online say she
gets 400 and 500 and a thousand
followers online then um well
sponsorships so it's a extra Revenue
stream for the techboy media and we also
be advertising what stuff on here like
podcast episode and also people will be
using her as an advertisement so she is
our official digital Advertiser for
Techo media um so tell us what you want
we've been trying to drive some
engagement um you can choose aa's next
outfit uh um because we get five free
promps on my phone for free um every
hour so that is at least 60 images
because you get about five images po
pumped um so that's amazing there and
last week we did talk about on the
podcast how we did have an offline AI
image generation technology app called
sdai stands for stable diffusion AI so
it's a decent application has multiple
models built in so you don't need to
download all of them like I did I
thought all of them were required to
download it um but each model is about a
gigabyte um in size and I used it takes
about 20 seconds you have to keep it in
the foreground at least on my phone um
it kept crashing in the background and
um it look I mean images were okay but
they're not of the quality at least yet
to post um to aa's official Instagram um
page now put that back
um wait wait wait oh
yeah so let's get back to the headlines
from the tech boy.org um Samsung Galaxy
this is our AI uh Samsung Newsroom um
article Samsung has released new smart
monitors again and for those of you who
don't know smart monitors are one of our
biggest we I mean we got thousands of
hits okay our website is one of the P at
top page of Google just be article so
thank you so much um Samsung for
releasing smart U monitto and me
deciding to write about them anyway
Samsung is writing unveiled new smart
monitors um so we got the um Odyssey o d
the uh which is the monitor in the
middle here um po Samsung news room and
then we got the smart monitor to M8
which you guys may remember so it's
basically uh from
a very famous article um so this monitor
is basically don't touch that this
article is basically a um it's crossed
between a TV and a monitor as you can
see I know this is a low resolution
image but it is running uh Tyson Tyson
Smart TV operating system and you can
see I have Netflix uh Disney plus Apple
TV plus which is kind of funny and over
here this is the gaming Monitor and then
you got the viewfinity S8 which appears
to be um a
uh one of those good monitors that
people look at speaking of I saw that
$1,500 monitor on at Apple I was like
wow this is expensive what a waste of
money the 5K monit and then I saw it on
Samsung like dang Samsung following an
Apple's
footsteps all right so the uh smart
monitor is has AI upscaling like uh TVs
now and voice assistants like Alexa and
Bixby and stuff like that and then
vinity is for color seeing and the
Odyssey R is for gaming so tell me in
the comments which uh monitor you like
the best all right now back to our human
generator article talking about stunning
AI wallpapers on the Galaxy s24 Ultra
and there's this new thing I found about
on a YouTube short that's why I actually
learned something from a YouTube short
um news flash um where Samsung Lex has
another built-in um option for monitors
not monitors for wallpapers and it's
kind of interesting so this is will be
for your lock screen wallpaper and you
have to go into a lab setting and full
article will be coming out about this
soon but I'm just going to show
you um you go into wallpapers and it's
called photo ambient mode uh we have to
enable this in labs and then we'll get
to regular so it's when you enable it in
Labs it will be right next to generative
wallpaper see it's called photo ambient
mode and when you click that um you can
either agree to use the Local web um to
change the photo Bas on your local we or
you could skip that and you can just
basically use in your city and then you
pick an image in there and if it's
raining in your city or in your local
location deping on if you allow it to
allow access to your location then um it
will show Rain on your lock screen if it
is uh Sunny which has been very sunny
here in Houston um you will see a bright
light coming over your lock screen so
right now it is night it is dark outside
so so there won't be anything on it but
um when it is sunny or rainy um you will
see rain or sun coming down from the on
this wallpaper which is from unplay or
something like that all right now back
to the Galaxy AI generated wallpapers
using your advanced intelligence
wallpapers U this works on all S Series
phones since s22 and on Z flip fold four
five and the upcoming six models so you
go into generative wallpaper you click
ative wallpaper and then you click all
the bubbles that that you want to select
you click wallpaper and style now if you
want to make your own if and when you
make your wallpaper it applies it can
need it apply to the home screen or lock
screen or all um and then you'll have
that annoying little you know the
generative wallpaper icon to so what you
can do is you can create a new blank
screen take a screenshot of it U either
crop that out or go in Samsung and um
Magic out not using the AI Magic Eraser
but using the Samsung Magic Eraser
speaking of I saw a Samsung commercial
where um the user was magic erasing
stuff using the new AI magic erase
instead of like the normal one and I
found it interesting because it wasn't
like too complicated stuff so I think
Samsung really wants you to use that
because a it's verifiable and B they
make money off of it or will be making
money off of it soon so I guess got kind
of um
they're going to be kind of like trying
to suppress it as much
um uh trying to suppress it as much all
right um oh I still need to share this
podcast let's go to
youtube.com all right um on last article
we were very busy and these were typed
on my uh keyboard here which is

so be sure to check out AA Harper um and
if you guys notice something similar to
this um where is she a yes anyway guys
be like wait I've seen this before it's
from a cell phone commercial um it's
based on the styler AI technology I
think I believe um let me see here let
me see if the original images in here
because I don't want to have to go find
this commercial um um it might be in
here okay let me log back in in fact it
did such a great job that um the
technology it forgot to add a face
because it wasn't supposed to be there
and I was like oh man um I wish it added
a face because we can't just it'd be
kind of weird just to have clothes um
pictur it up all right um oh here we go
here we are all right so as you can see
on screen let me make sure I'm sure I
get this time um here is from Styler AI
um you guys may remember this from the
cell phone commercial uh it's a Metro by
mob I was thinking um maybe Ava could
put uh this thing on but I have no idea
what you call this like what is that a
shirt with one sleeve anyway I'm not
expert and it's a tech channel uh
Christian channel uh Tech and Christian
Channel um so I don't have time to go
around and do women's fashion research
but using the image image prompt at a
0.5 similarity I probably should have 7
um to get the full look um well maybe
it's up for the hair because that's not
hair type it did get pretty good results
here that we were able to work with um
though I did have to change uh something
all right I I think I didn't use that
for it but I'm showing the results of
this technology which is simply amazing
now let's um switch over to this
channel called
um I forgot his name
oh I mean this has got to be the most
convoluted Christian YouTube channel
that I've ever uh wait he
went that I've ever seen in my life
okay so it it is very funny very very
funny all right so hopefully you can see
uh the thing on the screen I always say
that before you can actually see it
redeemed
zumu so as the title may tell you he is
a jiny older than me like zumu as in
like
[Music]
200000 yeah just like 2000 2000 2024
yeah so he's probably B 2000 maybe 2002
um who makes Christian videos it looks
like this is made in paint and I was
introduced to him by his I guess the
entire Bible
combined into one like he explained the
Bible it was good explanation 17 minute
video um it went from Genesis to Exodus
pretty good now uh then this video
here how I met the future Mrs zumu it
has got to be the most hilarious video
I've ever watched in my life or one of
the most hilarious videos I've ever
watched in my life and then he goes down
to some rabbit TR he literally got
ratioed one time from saying
non-denominational churches were
unbiblical and that that the comments
did was hilarious anyway uh how I met
the future Mrs zumu so he talks
about he talks about um
uh uh
H how he was in uh this is before the
pandemic in high school um in like 11th
grade I'm like and and and he was a
Christian and everyone was like I guess
teasing him I was hiding from everyone
and stu oh okay it's kind of like me
except I went on offense like I see that
on more defense um and then he's like
and then I went to this he went online
and he started this like long internet
argument and redeem zumo's Mrs
zumo's
uh uh what best friend shot a comment
and showed it to and then they went to
Bible studies with youut online he's in
New York she's in Kansas and they became
boyfriend and girlfriend I'm like but
then he goes into like how he was like a
strong person in his faith I was like oh
okay great we we could have if we were
the same age teamed up at school and and
then and then like team up and it was
like just totally totally just shocked
me um this is a literal comment on the
website I told it here uh he said Bas C
is C you don't he everything whatever
and then he says he called Evolution uh
based in biblical or something like that
I'm like what because that would ad
meant that if he went to my school and
we would I got so frustrated with ads on
YouTube I was watching shut up he would
have
uh he would have nuked me and I would
have nuked him back and then when I'm
deba the other kids in evolution he
would have teamed up with them I'll be
like oh my goodness that would have been
so sad because the uh the the arguments
that we probably would have had about
things like um this this video here oh
man we would have argued over that
for oh wait wait wait wait if Harper
could have gotten a a follow from
someone hopefully um
anyway anyway we would have been just
like arguing if he thought all the time
it been really funny
um yeah so very funny YouTube anyway uh
as you
guys as you guys might have seen on the
YouTube channel our YouTube channel and
I guess we can talk more about this guy
later um when it's not 912 at night
um maybe react to one of his videos um
one time um in a dedicated episode
um as you guys may have seen noticed on
the channel um we've been talking more
and more about um I'm me not talking
more more about stuff we've been adding
more videos here
so adding more Clips here because our
G24 Ultra is just so powerful that we
can get these video clips edited out and
on time without you know getting super
hot and our gaming stream from yesterday
hopefully you saw it it was
like it was yeah there it is it took a
really long time to set up and it lasted
for like 3 minutes it got hot on this
side here so like top I don't know maybe
that's where the processor is but
towards the
um how the heck do you get out of
this oh
switch
oh but towards the bottom it was
completely fine so uh heat management is
a lot better um um online than it is on
regular pH uh
regular s24
Ultra
s20 oh my gosh s22 plus so that is
interesting um to say the least oh wow
wow AA Harper let's go let's
go all right so according to our
analytics here AA haror in the the last
uh 30 minutes got three likes from yours
truly and Cabra 86 uh liked it as well
any let's go back to our YouTube channel
and then we'll go into more more AA
Harper uh likes so um people are liking
our story so that is that's good um
oh we got a message that is good that is
always a good sign
um and unfortunately Samsung's uh
translation features do not work in
uh do not work in Instagram Direct
messaging applications anyway so we got
our oh we lives all right here we go so
for our videos we've been cutting stuff
from our most viral moment um what come
on we pushed this video like crazy only
five views I like this at least at least
this one got 24 um 24 views here so as
you can see here we've been slowly
adding more Clips to our repertoire and
then also some more YouTube shorts here
um as our podcast
is as our podcast is growing and
speaking of our most viral moments I
think we have another moment that's
going to top all moments this moment
will live this moment will live in uh
not infamy just it's going to be the
most famous moment of all time in all of
uh Reddit
history here it is uh us the lucky Royal
6156
um let's check out my comments
[Music]
let us uh let us go up the uh the uh the
Bastion of intelligence and greatness
that is our high school which is
basically our teenagers which is a bunch
of idiots running around but less
idiotic and here he is here is the most
epic comment ever made on the Forum and
that will ever be made on the Forum here
it is
I'm going to highlight
this
um here we go essentially High School is
a terrible place to find a relationship
High School is your world and when you
date you're bringing two countries
together you'll be both watched by both
friend groups imagine the NSA sparing on
your leak chats and Digital Data being
analyzed the CIA people from the dating
friend group spying on you because uh
the CIA would be external uh
United States spying on other countries
and then the FBI internal spying within
your own friend group and you have to be
the Secret Service protecting your
boyfriend girlfriend from thieves and
bullies not to mention the boyfriend and
girlfriend might be the iOS other than
gifts to see if you are good enough on
whole school we know what is going on
causing pressure that is right kiddos
and fans of all ages we just compare
that to all intelligence agencies coming
on you and of course that will be um
clipped as soon as this podcast goes off
air um because that moment better go
viral oh we got another message
um um it's in Spanish thank goodness for
Google Translate
Okay and of course make sure you check
out our new blog SS
ltw
um okay um now I just have to put do you
want add into Spanish do you want an
add people
talk all right um so greatest comment of
all time left on
reddit.com in my own personal and
completely unbiased opinion now um
oh oh oh I think we got something now um
let's see what we have here on the
YouTube homepages oh maybe we can react
to our own most survival moments and
explain them um explain them as I am
chatting with this person with
ail a
oh
sorry so let's go through our most viral
moments um we're going to be reacting to
a reaction in um epic YouTuber form and
hopefully this video gets a great
reaction from all the fans I know it's
late so here is our most vial
moments without you know fear and talk
to different
ah yes this is from the NTV
controversial episode uh uh from October
7th
2023 um when I called prental control
spyer apps uh
malware uh that that that got I mean if
NTB paid in traffic I would have made a
lot of money
uh um I would have made a lot of money
so let's let's get back to the clip um
if you had like a practically mware on
your phone and I was also claiming that
I was also way over price $30 a month
$300 a year $360 a year to spy on
someone I'm like might as well give $30
a month that's I mean it's practically a
scam like oh oh sorry um for like $30 a
month that's I mean it's practic a
scam here you go it's like that
sometimes this is uh AUST 26 2023 is
highlighted because um I didn't even
attend the school yet I like that
sometimes I have my own spency today I
was using my boogie board to plan out
how I'm going to win an election an
election I had no idea about had no
strategy about uh no strategy for um you
can also read about this on SS ltw
because I did not attend school
yet oh yes here we go this is a book I
read in school um here we go 15-year-old
it's from the uh 4:30 episode when I was
basically so upset um when I got kicked
off into okay so you got the girl and
you got the boy okay and they come
together and they say oh this is on the
teenage dating section that was that was
funny that that section was crazy I
was um that that section was
crazy pardon me uh I'm I'm chatting in
Spanish to someone
maybe we'll buy a better laptop or
better equipment
um uh if he uh agrees hey we're going to
uh date each other which essentially
means that which according to this book
I think the reason you want to date is
because you have emotions that you can't
control something stupid yeah it was
from like yeah I was like what are you
talking about guy what do you mean you
can't control look at me I'm perfectly
under control right now you don't see me
running around there sending random
messages to AA har do you like I don't
know looking at which the goal of dating
is obvious because if you're just dating
for fun or whatever like I I don't get
it just be friend oh yeah that was a
that was a great that was a great uh
that was a great quote I don't get it
just be friend because if you just
dating for fun or whatever like I I
don't get it just be friend oh here we
go here we go here we go so this is from
the epic you know that song thing you
guys can read about that you you you
guys see saw that moment you know C-SPAN
cpan viewers
no know what what's going on anyway um
so this is from her uh trademark Who
quote and I said I might as well
trademark T datings a threat to National
Security which uh I've literally said
multiple times and people just sat
around like okay I'm like
okay the only people who should oh yes
this is from uh our Dex podcasting
episodes before we went live last year
in the summer because my laptop is acing
up as you can see in Samsung internet
and he's talking about the Apple
spending $3,500 on a toy are like
millionaires yet if history is any
guide it's not a toy per say it's a tool
and one of the problems that we've been
having here is that uh you cannot access
external Camas on other external
applications uh on Android applications
which is a problem like we're using a
separate app here um for that but for
live streaming you know your browser has
to be able to access the
camera um which is a problem and that's
why I need wiater and vectress to come
on and get with the program so I can get
desktop Chrome on here and be able to
podcast from my phone and one of the
problems with this USBC monitor is it is
annoying okay first of all for some
reason sometimes it tells me that I have
water in my port when I plug this in
this phone is even seen rain it's never
been dropped in a pedal and second of
all um and sorry we're going into this
tent but this this monitor keeps
disconnecting from my Compu from my
phone every three minutes like what is
wrong with you
like like I don't get it but anyway
let's go back to the clip not one that
you need or I
need and of course the price would
probably come down eventually
oh oh sorry and of course the price
would probably come down
eventually oh here we go here we go this
this is an epic exchange this this kid
not kid
um this person was talking about like
privacy of drones and I was like I want
to spy drone so we just had this epic
exchange here so I was like I want a
drone for Christmas I was like for
National Security of course I'm on the
nationally secure border of the
backyard everything that you don't like
because you're scared it's going to oh
yes this is from last week the Epic
quote I mean we put that in a gold frame
um somewhere you can't illegalize
everything that you don't like Place
jobs and cause the death
civilization they're always whining
about the death of Western
Civilization uh but they never give any
like Solutions in terms of AI uh um in
terms of
AI which is I guess that's why working
together with the new prot tech social
media website which maybe a might join
maybe who knows
uh I think we might get our first sale
who knows in Spanish uh that would be
kind of nice oh she sent some more
stuff he sent some more because it's
going to be really short oh yeah this is
from 2022 I think we taped this from my
phone and two the
point I hate Tik Tok that was that that
was from I hate Tik Tac episode which
hating Tik Tac is very profitable um
like we got a a thousand views on Tik
Tock uh not on Tik Tok about hitting Tik
Tok
um and
about hting Tik Tok so uh if any of you
guys are having a problem finding a
career uh just hate Tik Tock very
profitable I hate AI I mean Michael noes
Matt walls very successful men I'll find
it
later oh yes it was a viral moment so
this was back when we didn't live stream
podcast I had to edit this back in um
and I was looking for this clip of an
episode called day off from um
loop the loop show which is a video uh
uh thing for kids to um
uh wait we gotta we got to check this in
um for kids
to um it's like a devotional series
thing uh okay this person doesn't
understand anything maybe my translation
isn't that's good okay um you
uh devotional from a song from like five
well yeah 2024 from five years ago four
years ago when this is tapes
um but here we go so I click this in and
as you can see the ls just read the ls
on the screen just towards the bottom
to the
right that's right guys I dove the
depths of the inter and then I dove the
deps of the interet to edit us back into
the podcast which why you saw that
transition and found day off by life
kids Loop all we did this was just get
the special sound effect and then we
linked it back to a thing about um
smartphones iPhone 5S um which was taped
five years ago we went on and talk about
the iPhone 5S speaking of smartphones
this is movie uh new movie thing um that
came out from Angel Studios it's called
sight and it's based in 2007 right and
the smartphones that they're using in
there to be based in 2007 are so wild
like this lady lit pulls out thisal LG
Chocolate uh but it's an actual
smartphone so I'm like they did not have
touchscreen smartphones like that back
in 2007 except for the iPhone and it was
not an iPhone though someone did use an
iPhone and that was obviously Flex that
someone was like using
iPhones Techo media do oh yes yes this
this is a clip this this this is epic
right here just listen to these wise
words of wisdom uh this is from our spy
episode a few months
ago dating clip here we can down
everything else in this episode here we
go here we go most most Great Clip here
we go fine teenage dating no that's
right spying on people fine teenage
dating
no that that was that was oh my gosh
they have so much Spanish in here uh I
cannot translate fast enough um too
bad been with me since the accident it
is unfortunate isab um all right here we
go
um let me just send it in and then copy
paste all right um after our messages
from our sponser oh yeah this is uh so
this bunch of bunch of D sponses and I
watch a lot of those videos so all these
sponses are in my videos here we go sale
skin care no is not sponsoring us nor is
Express VPN nor is Patriot mobile nor is
which patre Mobile's kind of overpriced
that other one you know I forgot
top post is AA Harper in address ah yes
here here it is context this is
literally right before my School's prom
which I
um uh made the voting software for
um
like oh great
all right hope we can get our
money oh yeah here see but in my opinion
dresses are
inefficient I should just CLI it right
there all right so we were looking at a
Harper's analytics and back then I guess
people have become more sane now like if
you look at a Hopper's analytics which
we will get into after I finish chatting
with this guy um you can see that people
like you know normal clothes that you
can actually do stuff in other than uh
dresses but back then I guess people
always like the dress post which was
kind of weird because dress is are
inefficient I still stand by that okay
imagine you're like oh my gosh you can't
even see it yeah there we go so our top
yeah so as you guys can see here our top
there are like our top five um posts and
like does that count as a dress whatever
that's inefficient
inefficient uh inefficient inefficient
inefficient is AA in a addess and I 500
I can confirm I am not a butterfly pee
Oh this is from that uh that
uh that um what's it called I forgot
what it's called oh it's some plant
scanner app and it I took a picture of
me um
I all right I guess we'll just do this
guy for free all right here we go
um and I will never become a butterfly
PE and notice how if you download it
you'll get this SS icon parents to find
the most reliable devices with the best
featur oh this is another one of the
anti uh anti uh parental control spy
application things this just basically a
whole list of mare little infested
phones that don't let you do anything
and overpriced piece of your junk it's
just like those minimal list phones that
charge you $300 for not being able to
access the internet like this phone
charges you $300 for not being able to
access to Internet or being able to text
someone quote
unquote yes scaming the kids and the
parents they're scamming the kids and
they're thinking that they're great
phones that no one's going to tease them
for first of all those are budget
Samsung devices and they look awful and
second of all you're lucky if you even
got a bud Samsung device because maybe
they ripped off ZTE or something like
that and you're gonna get teased not
saying you should buy a phone just
because you're not gonna get teased but
I mean that's uh that's a
uh
that's it's it's a lie okay it's bad
marketing and second of all um
and second of
all
um and second of all um they're scaming
the parents too because um those phones
are not worth the phone that they were
selling they're selling
a they're selling a uh old Samsung for a
midrange price for minimal features so
it doesn't even have to work features
they mean pre-installed spyware under
the guys of parental control
okay it is time to declare war on the
verge the vge is a sick oh yeah that was
from uh when
still are clearing War the votes from
all these evil tech companies that uh
wanted to promote anti-b agendas in
their Tech blogs and couldn't just stick
to writing Tech and so he boarded those
companies unfortunately uh still are um
I guess we did kind of have a win over
them a little bit um
yeah so this is from 20 Chang an evil
company and they must be destroyed it
said that she'll be home by 12 and the
oh yeah this is from a book that book is
just wacky
um you better be able to see this on
screen okay good you are okay mean
midnight okay 12 oh yeah so one time
they're talking about compromise and I
know this is 1985 but at
no at no point in time have I ever
12 a.m. Al so that is not a comprom that
is not a compromise that is not a
compromise I mean this episode was kind
of Epic but kind of sad at the same time
because I was like really sad uh from
losing my community but we built back
and we're back with our new NCB not the
boy and hopefully will stand strong on
the test of time and we did write into
our to that teenagers are allowed so God
bless you guys what on Earth are you in
1987 or in 2024 doing out at midnight at
a party in second of all that is a that
is a genuine quote like what are you
doing doing uh out at that time like
come on that persective here which all
you interviewers will know uh does
capsuling software got that wrong
instead of an
NTV um completely in toally
true if if I tried to pull that which uh
it still stands true to today even
though this was taped in
April like the net chance of that
happening okay is equivalent to the net
chance of teenage dating
relationships succeeding which why
succeeding we mean like ending up in
marriage oh we still got another message
um from this D is the that chance of me
being able to invite a friend from
school to my house which is the net
chance of someone rebuilding a bridge
out of six who doesn't have an
engineering degree and expecting the car
to go across it without the car falling
in all just to say that's a net chance
of zero even this book which which which
is crazy okay I mean if you think that's
crazy point in this book when it get to
the section on dating I was thinking
okay the obvious thing would be to do
would be that was that was crazy all
right this clip is epic so this is one
of my most famous videos here is from
react to that ging tombs and he actually
beats us which is crazy um because he is
not g
um and I didn't understand the ging Tims
I don't think skib was in here I think
RZ was in here I
think is that in the Bible and oh yes uh
the word was uh shik so I go up there
there used to be a thing up here my
Bible is up there and I'm checking it's
uh it's not KJV so then I go search
Bible Gateway hand I have to check is
the W this is December of 20 uh no
November this first month sorry January
2019 this is
insane not 19
2023 I should for the word shft in here
and we got no
hits I so that's one of our most famous
famous epic moments of uh of of uh it of
all time so uh before we leave let's um
check out uh AA Harper which I sometimes
forgot her name which is kind of sad but
now I I know that name AA hoer all right
so let's view our insights I think it's
better than the mobile application oh no
no no this is good it's good as you guys
can see here and I mean we are all in
you can't even see we are all in on
Wheels now because I mean as you can see
here um my content type within the last
30 days uh
241 engagement on reals versus 114 posts
114 engagement on posts versus 25 to on
stories and our follower the non-f
follower account is sad 233 versus 76 is
said and look at our top content based
on
whoa whoa see I telling you all in on
reals top four so uh gold silver and
bronze and I guess the runner up goes to
um reals we got our what's this I don't
remember what this one is about oh yeah
it's the sync to the ntional Anem again
this one is also sync to uh song that is
it's a 4 second video and then these B
videos basically the same and this is
just one of her in a graphic t-shirt
thank you
uh uh the app on my phone very good very
good all and then a post there so top
content based on engagement which I
guess with comments uh still pictures
and still still still don't dress
because inefficiency see and Scots I
guess less and for some reason uh whoa
our most active time has changed it used
to be at 9:00 am now it's 6 which is sad
because I get up at 6 so fortunately I
won't you guys won't be getting what you
want at 6 um oh no no no no no no no
9:00 am is still pulling out on Tuesdays
uh
Wednesdays oh nope nope back to six so
between six and nine which makes sense
because as you can see from our
geographical
geographical fans man 105 views since
June 6th um I said war on there and got
people to like and follow but as uh as
you can see from GE geographical data at
least in the mobile application um most
of some our fans come from India so
which makes sense why
uh
uh it the people will be most active at
6: and 9 a.m. United States Central Time
um United States central time so um I
guess if any of you guys have questions
we'll do a better episode next week
that's off for now God bless Tech talk
to you later PR for the nation and oh
remember subscribe to not the boy and AA
Harper let's see if we can get our user
base up remember that</pre>
