<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 12923</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
this week in the tech boy podcast we
have plumy to talk about with you today
including CH the boss's phone rankings
we're going to go over that today and
also speaking of phone rankings we have
to talk about this absolutely terrible
okay so these these parenting blogs uh
Teenage parenting blogs not Christian
oriented absolutely hilarious articles
that they wrun on this site but what's
even more hilarious than the Articles
they want the site it's just you know
like normal teenage stuff which I guess
we can like read the headlines for like
the amount of dumb stuff that they have
said on this website is it it it's
revolting honestly
honestly we should get into this right
now yeah so um I bookmarked this website
called very well family and oh my
goodness I have not seen this much dumb
stuff a day in my life um ever since I
went to uh see bookm manager we're GNA
show this on the screen hopefully my
audio sounds good to you
guys okay here we
go I think it's very well family let me
check the book
ah yes 10 best cell phones for kids of
2023 okay and before we get to this
we're just going to look at the you know
the content that this website likes to
produce for for their General audience
what what they um act like it's you know
Talent okay um I'm pretty sure that half
this is AI generated because nothing can
be this bad okay so what we were looking
at is the very well family teen teen
guide uh so I think we have to type
in there it is
teens the very well family teen side of
the web oh wait no sorry it's your
parenting mag that had the terrible
articles
okay yeah these are pretty terrible
articles too but I think it was your
your teen mag that has terrible articles
nonetheless here it is very well family
the best cell phones for kids of 2023
okay this article was written this year
I am so sorry but these people could not
write a cell phone review article if the
lives depended on it okay now let's get
into this
okay they surveyed 500 pents to find the
most reliable devices with the best
features quote unquote and by best
features they mean pre-installed spyware
under the guise of parental control okay
um and look we've been through this and
people got mad at me for that you can go
back and read the clips and what see the
clips of that whatever but honestly even
if you're a pro provincial control
whatever but these phones absolutely
scams okay first of all let's look at
this graphic here we got the Galaxy S8
um from
2017 okay so according to my
calculations that would be about six
years ago so that's a no okay this is
the iPhone sc3 and then we got the Kitty
Buzz 3 which should be called which
probably be be name the bezel Buzz thing
because I'm pretty sure there's more
bezel on the screen on that thing but
best probably prevent drops and stuff
which this isn't even a phone is it's
just a compressed
tablet okay it's basically a step up
from those fake phones that you give to
kids anyway let's move on here so
they're going to take off the age
contracts we don't need to talk about
most families before Apple or Samsung
phone for their
children I wonder why maybe it's because
they're the two most popular brands in
the United States and maybe it's because
you only talk to 500 parents and maybe
they didn't know what they were talking
about their best overall phone was the
great wonderful and
Almighty iPhone
se3 no why you couldn't get I I don't
know say an iPhone 12 iPhone 13 mini no
the iPhone se3 but that's a decent phone
I guess for a kid and then you say the
best for big kids is the S21 f5g that
makes absolutely no sense here okay now
from a tech review perspective the S21
f5g is probably better than the iPhone
se but the best for big kids these same
big kids unless they're part of Team 13
which they should obviously join um
aren't going to want a Galaxy S21 f8 and
I'm going to go with the inferior iPhone
because this is America and in America
we use iPhones unless you're like me
best eco-friendly what is it with these
people okay Samsung and Apple you
already took the charg out the box why
on Earth do I care if the kid that I if
the phone that I buy for my kid is
ecofriendly best watch based best safety
features which this should be control
shift eyed to best scam
$489 for this piece of junk this is a
three times um price increase okay this
device if it was a state of emergency
and a hurricane flew through Houston and
they were selling these phones and gas
stations they would get fined and
arrested for Price Scouting For The
absolutely terrible deal that this thing
is this thing is essentially two and a
half times more for the privilege for
the phone to not connect to the
internet okay we're going to get through
this entire two okay so here's the
iPhone
se3 they pick it as the best phone for
kids it is water and dust resistant so
that's good and I recommend it because
it it it's hundreds less than the iPhone
12 I don't know what they're talking
about let's look at the iPhone 12 prices
here um
[Music]
12 not to mention that the iPhone 12
supports you know like a a big bigger
screen so here we go Amazon 64 gab of
storage which is table in this day and
age but it's an iPhone so don't get away
with it here it is the iPhone 12 from
Amazon hundreds less quote unquote this
is only
$32.80 which um according to my
calculations is less than $429 in less
than
$449 so yeah that one's out of it okay
um
we love the 4.7 in widescreen display
it's not widescreen with a traditional
home button it stopped being traditional
in 2017 okay this has been a great
article in 2017 don't worry about FAL
controls Apple takes care of that for
you the iPhone SC parents and caregivers
can reap the benefits of screen time
parental controls Family Sharing and
find M which allows families uh to
locate loss of stolen
phones
okay the best for big kids the Galaxy
S21 Fe
5G and then they get a fact drunk only
64 gigabyte storage option that is a lie
there is no 64 gab storage option on
this device it's 128 no builtin parental
controls is Google family L they'll
survive okay um we appreciate the facial
recognition lacking for extra security
if a child for gets their phone at
school or the
park but it's not even
secure it's 2D based it has fingerprints
SC in the screen for better and the S31
can definitely keep up to your child's
games thanks to its fast Dynamic
display what does that even mean are
they talking about the 120 HZ feature
why are they calling it a dynamic damic
display in this sentence here okay it Fe
also features virtual assistant Bixby
which can remind kids of sports practice
to do their homework and more okay um
sorry to tell you this but I am probably
the only person in the continental
United States who actually uses Bixby no
kid is gonna use Bixby okay next there
stores up to
128 gigabytes of
photos you just said is only 64 up here
do
better and then you said that there's no
buil-in prental controls and then you
just say oh well there's Google family
link Life
360 yeah it's compatible
with this phone is an improved version
no it's not of our two G favorites the
now discontinu Galaxy s20 and Galaxy S8
this has nothing to do with the Galaxy
S8 the Galaxy S8 released by over five
years
ago all right anyway and did they can't
even spell the dang thing correctly the
galxy x21 Fe
X okay
whatever the best beginner phone the gab
phone
Z2 so look at this the pros are that it
has 14 kid safe apps only GPS tracking
and internet social media is it needs
internet for the GPS tracking so there
is a way to get a browser on do and then
you said that there's no games on here
but then you list having no games as a
benefit when used minimally the phone's
battery lasts up to a few days without
needing a
recharge there's nothing to do on it of
course it's G to last all day
the phone also
has the kids will love the phone's two
cameras for selfies or taking pictures
with friends and parents will love to
added fingerprint security it sounds
counterintuitive for a phone that's
built for parents to see everything on
it seems kind of
counterintuitive like unless your
passage uploaded to the servers which is
a totally different
problem
okay now on to the next thing the Terra
Cube Drive which honestly this design is
interesting I
mean made with a recycled material and
biodegradable case oh how nice of them
I've always put my phone into the ground
after it got old and started the by the
gra process once my a715g died is not
signal I just buried it in the ground so
it could start
biodegrading that's the only reason and
this the drive includes pin patter and
finger face yeah it's basically an
Android phone with provincial controls
built on top which means they'll be
bypassed this by like resetting it
anyway but and then there's the VTech
Kitty Buzz which we already talked about
that it's basically a tablet but let's
talk about
this scam of a
device the pinwell pinwell plus three
kid
smartphone now you may be saying hey
this kind of looks uh normal familiar
yeah that's because it's a Samsung
Galaxy
a13 or 15 or something some budget phone
that you can find on the side of the
road probably get for free from your
carrier for $150 tops or less okay and
they put their parental control software
on here okay which you can get for
freeish
and yeah it says it's a Samsung Galaxy
a13 but it comes with provincial
controls and it blocks there's no
internet browser
app cost
$150 this phone is retailing for about
$500 that's a $350 um discrepancy so
either you can buy three Galaxy a15s
with internet and social media and then
put your little blocking apps on there
or you can buy one pin wheel plus three
for
$500 right and it's still a terrible
phone for that price right and it has
the privilege of not having the internet
not having an app store but you do get
the privilege of having therapist screen
apps how however because the phone is
still based off of Android for the extra
$350 that you have spent on your lovely
phone you can just use the little volume
button reset thing and reset it back to
being a Galaxy
a13 I looked it up so
$350 get you a device that with a press
of a button can get sent back to a 100
$50
device that is a that's a scam like this
software that can basically see all
text only select approved
contacts get your GPS location and block
all
applications this software is not worth
$350
okay let's say you took a overrated F2
control
application $30 a
month you're essentially paying for a
phone plus toal Control software for an
entire year for it to be built
in not to mention
that should your
kid like want to access the internet
from their phone at one
time that phone's a piece of junk
essentially unless you do the reset
which then you don't have the software
which you pay
$250 oh
$329 well these people can't even write
an article you said it was $489 now you
say it's $329 that's still too much
$200 it then bet best doable the Palm
Phone are you kidding me this thing's 2
Ines and this thing is laughable battery
sometimes drains quickly oh maybe just
maybe it's because the battery is one
inch why would you get this for
someone may not be ideal for younger
kids probably because it's a choking
hazard they might accidentally put it
into their mouth and swallow it
or maybe they won't be able to touch
these tiny little icons on this weird
little launcher
here dust and water resistance location
tracking and prental control via Google
family every phone from the past seven
years could do
that kitchen constantly under finding a
cell phone that's doable is a must it's
the size of a credit card is dust and
water resistant and it's made with
impact resistant glass
uh glass it has an Android interface so
kids can browse through Google Play and
stream music too No One's Gonna it is
two inches okay I could put this in the
bottom of my shoe this is the kind of
phone you would give to someone if
they're trying to break out of
prison this is basically a GPS tracker
disguises a
phone and why on Earth there are better
flip bones out there
like I mean at least it has Alexa I
guess but why this it is $50 but then
you have to pay for extra Lively
coverage let's say you have T-Mobile or
something you have to pay for a separate
line for your kid
like
why okay no internet say social media
that's a lie okay has Amazon Alexa on
here pretty you could probably figure
out to get a browser on it's probably
running Android or something like I
don't think they they they I don't think
they spent the time to make their own
operating systems like that that's way
too much money all well let's get off
the topic of horrible parenting uh
websites tech review guides um let's get
down to Tech boy.org which
produced articles about spying on people
for like let's
see yeah great so um the best
applications to spy on your phone RP
people mini and uh best applications for
to spy on people with your phone part
two also I guess we can talk about that
notification thingy and don't be alarmed
because I'm pretty sure you need a
subpoena I want to get into it all right
here we
go so so let's get into this the best
spy applications for your phone part
one okay for data
security Samsung secure folder and
Google Google files are good
applications to hide uh data
inside
um Google files says no reset so just
remember that if you forget your PIN
Google Samsung secure folder does allow
a reset via email or you can turn that
off audio recording you can just use the
basic audio recorder built into your
phone if you don't have one you can just
you know download one but if you have a
builtin
one um you you you can program it like
my phone's programmed and when I hold
down a specific button on the display it
will start recording a f recording audio
alternatively if you wanted to hear
audio from say 30 ft away all you need
is a cheap pair of bluetooth headphones
this is basically an upgraded version of
the old walkie-talkie in a room trick
put walk you put the app in there you
syn it pair it walk out you can hear
what's going on and then in the specific
version of the application you can can
record so there's
that and for photos you can just use the
built-in camera uh in here in your phone
uh a year ago we talked about the hidden
spy trck in your Android phone where you
can like basically blow the camera
out and if you want to have basically
Wi-Fi based surveillance I recommend the
AL food Home Security application as
it's pretty good you can hear and see
everything and has most in the setion
you can get everything that you need for
free and then we're going to go over to
part two where we go more in depth and
if you guys like this series uh make
sure to tell us and we'll keep going
okay so if you want to bug people if you
go into your dialo settings I saw this
on like a five minute hack video what
you do is you open your dial application
and go to the settings and have Auto
pickup calls making sure that auto picks
up calls means that if you were to call
your phone or anyone Wass to call your
phone your phone will automatically pick
it up and you hear everything around it
however this could become
counterproductive because you might
forget to turn it off and then people
will hear what you're doing and your spy
trick basically turns itself in so if
you have a your phone programmed say you
have if this and that or mod and routine
you can say um if a specific number so
you make your own Google Voice number or
you have a separate cell phone number
calls my phone then start a recording
and make sure my phone's on silent you
can program your phone to do that now a
scenario that you might want to use this
in is
if let's say
that you need to collect information
about
something right but you need to remotely
activate your
phone from from somewhere so that you're
not know accused of Suspicion you could
have someone I guess accidentally leave
or drop off your phone or just somehow
get into the place it needs to be and
then call it and then you go back and
pick it up later and the benefit of this
is that your phone will be locked so as
long as you don't have this little like
recording notification or widget where
someone can stop it and delete it then
it should be fine right now for tracking
and mapping of course if you need to
track something using the phone you can
always use the basic find my phone
services they fine right but for a
better GS spal oent whatever you can use
Google
uh Earth to get 3D SL street view Fen
views of places to map out whatever
you're mapping out um just collect that
on the place that you're visiting and in
for stenography um you can hide
information in your uh photos using exif
Editor to change exf data into image um
if you find a specific program that
allows you to share the exf data sh
photos that still have the exf data
embedded SMS doesn't let you do that but
let's say maybe via email or something
then that would be a good way to
communicate via image with someone
without having to type it into word in
Signal tracing you can also trace the B
Bluetooth signals just by via Bluetooth
uh signals and beo
mini iip beo mini broken by Apple um be
Cloud's back up but b mini is still
being worked on
um but but let's say BP mini has
miraculous
recovery it say it comes back it worked
really well it was a nice two days but
let's say that b mini comes back and and
works okay so SMS RCS support has been
teased but if it comes that would be
great because you can message everything
in one application however to be fair to
my Android users this application is
bare boned you can barely customize it
your profile picture is either your
Google account profile picture or the B
basically the beoo stock image just in
different colors it it is the void of
customization you cannot group messages
like in Samsung messages you cannot
theme messages you cannot
select there is no customization
whatsoever none okay I'm pretty sure
that iMessage Apple's iMessage has more
customization than this and then a flat
wait I'd be willing to pay maybe $10 $5
for this but to be paying
$25 yeah $25 for the rest of my life to
communicate with someone via iMessage
which I
mean is better than some of those pral
control like the phone Spate things but
it's still exor
it like 25 it's not exor but still $25
yearly to message
someone like maybe now because they're
going through a problem and they need
you know to pay all the people but $10
would be enough I mean I understand for
people Cloud why you'd have to pay $4.99
because they have to keep the servos up
they have to buy all the Mac Minis and
Etc but for people mini there's not that
many servos that it's
communicating which is
communicated
okay um that's all the headlines from
the tech
boy.org
today um now we're going to get into our
video reaction we're GNA be reacting to
M who's the boss his most recent video
but the video about
his phones of the hear it we'll see if
we agree with them oh and hello to our
first visitor please come in and chat
these are best smartphones of
2023 okay so my smartphone that I've
been using for all of 2023
is is the Galaxy s20 uh2 plus
um as you can see it on the
screen um I had to take this off because
it was blowing off my camera like the
extreme skin like all the gunk was
getting on out whatever so yeah it's
basically a two-tone basically an S21
now all right so let's get back to Mr
showing the tab and there we go new
contenders phones that have vastly
improved as well as past Giants who've
just fallen off the radar so because
it's been such a big one I have custom
designed 10 different trophies to award
to the winners of our 10 different
categories all leading up to the single
best smartphone in the market right now
and the winner of this giant thing so
let's start with the most improved
Awards which company has made the
biggest jump from their last phone and
it has to be Google look at this all
right so let's think about this this is
the Google pixel 7 uh sorry Google pixel
8 Pro over the Google pixel 7 Pro okay
um let's let's listen to the benefits
for the as here and then let's think
about the other people or companies that
he that he could have chosen so let's
say Samsung which would have been the
s22 ultra over the S s22 Ultra over s22
Ultra okay there's Apple who I mean
honestly could
could could have won this award with the
iPhone 15 switching to USBC and then of
course the other like Chinese brand said
he gets a test due to being in the UK
and you know being
major Beast of a trophy so proud of this
when the pixel 6 launched last year it
gave us this glimpse of something
special a bit of neverbe seen software
magic but it was kind of hard to
appreciate it when the phone was plagued
with reception issues bugs and glitches
all around a wonky fingerprint scanner
and some pretty grainy looking video
recording I can see pixels in the pixel
so considering all of that I am
genuinely shocked that in one year they
fixed all of those issues with the pixel
7s and that allows you to focus on what
pixel
7s oh long
video I was going to say I was confused
why is she talking about the
pixel she talking about the pixel 7
sorry about that
guys this year has finally shaken up the
smartphone
market I was also wondering why he
was we've had new contenders phon that
have vastly improv as well as past
Giants who've just fallen off the radar
so because it's been such a big one I
have custom design 10 that phone to oh
there best smart phones of
2023 that's best smart phones for Market
in 20 there we go here we go 23 has
definitely had its lows and its highs
there's the large proportion of
companies who just carried on doing
their own thing making slight fairly
unambitious improvements to what they
know already works but then at the same
time we've also had both a couple of
pretty major flops and some of the
biggest game changers we've seen in
years new phones or emerging companies
just coming in and dropping Bombshells
that we never saw coming so with all of
this in mind who makes the best phone
for you and who's made straight up the
best phone of the year and yes we did
specifically get wooden spoon trophies
made for the losers you'll see who's
written here very surely okay let's
start with fbls because this is one of
those markets where I do genuinely
believe we have just witnessed a game
changer I mean Samsung has basically
been the winner by default for the last
5 years being the only company to
actually make a top tier foldable that's
also globally available and yeah they
are making good phones but you can also
definitely send all right let's see zold
5 or OnePlus open okay so OnePlus open I
would really like well I haven't used it
but I really like the software that I've
seen on Des spit screen uh screening
applications I also like the Des an IR
blasters that's nice
um zold 5 you know it has decks secure
folder which I think OnePlus has an
alternative
to um so it's probably just all comes
down to who software is better um I
think the OnePlus camera is better
and we'd have to test out the different
desktop moves if they have the
complacency with how quickly the
company's foldables went from the fut is
no absolutely not not top
twoing with their first entry to here's
a 4% better camera than the last vable
and also just how long it's taking them
to fix some of the well yeah but you
have to think about it like it's a phone
that folds in half that's innovation in
and of
itself fundamental issues with foldables
like the crease for the longest time
Samsung has needed competition and just
now I'd say that is a lot of phones on
his table that's like
$112,000 just sitting right there they
finally got it in the form the OnePlus
open it has a more competitive price
better cameras nicer construction it
also has a great uh design like the
front screen's
usable and I think as spe ratio makes it
so that it's basically the same I it's
like a square it's got longer battery
life and most importantly unique
software that really makes the big
screen useful it's the first ever
foldable to actually compete with the
Samsung and in my opinion genuinely just
straight up come out on top and thanks
to OnePlus also being part of the same
company as Oppo they managed to use both
companies distribution networks to do
that while also overcoming the hurdle
that most foldables have failed at
making it internationally available and
that is why I'm giving it the award for
best foldable of 2023 and if anyone from
OnePlus is watching this just ping us if
you want it because uh last year every
single company collected theirs except
for Apple the shakeups continue as we
now go on to the best compact phone for
a few years now I've been consistently
giving this award to one company Asus
they make this all right so let's think
about this you think it's G to be Asus
or Samsung so Samsung has the s22 oh I
think he pi the different company but
Samsung has the s23 series right s23 6.1
inches right that's basically compact it
has all the flex features of the s23
plus except for Ultra wide band it has
smaller battery a smaller screen size um
same screen resolution as the s22 plus
s23 plus I believe um it has decks has
all of that it even has a telephoto
Optical like zoom camera which assus
lacks however he picks Sony due to its
battery life I think and I think it's
more affordable however Sony's not more
Global like you can't just walk in by
only one Mark 5 in the United States
this line of phones called the Zen
phones which are basically Flagship
specifications but bottled up into a
body that's a good 25% smaller but this
time around why why would you want a
smaller
phone my phone is my pocket computer I'm
going to use it while the latest Z phone
10 it is still a good phone it has had a
price increase from €700 to €800 and
very little has been upgraded for it it
moves it to a tier where it's basically
competing directly with the likes
of Samsung's flagships and I just don't
feel quite like the Camera Tuning or the
software support is close to this level
so what are your other options well I've
actually played around quite a lot with
this base Galaxy s23 I think this phone
looks good I think it performs well it's
a really great size and the cameras are
a lot better than the specs make them
seem thanks to Samsung's tuning so I
mean the specs make them seem good it's
a very close second but then who takes
it well I genuin think the best compact
phone of 2023 belongs to none other than
Sony with the xeria 5 Mark 5 I just
think about
this xeria 5 um five mark five and I'm
going to just do like a rting comparison
of it to the Galaxy Z flip back let's go
the thing is really high spec it's got
cameras that so long as you're willing
to put a of time into learning how to
properly use have a really high ceiling
what I particularly appreciate is that
it battery life is way longer than the
Samsung's like it will literally so
Samsung Z4 5 would obviously lose to the
one more 5 there the cameras are
probably better on Sony but Samsung
would be more automatic and more Punchy
I guess it's better for social media and
of course you get the angle and stand
all that vlogging I guess we still be on
30% by the time the Samsung runs out and
also the ratio the tall narrow ratio of
this phone makes it the software
looks maybe it's the this looks also
2018 Android 9es the clock this
wallpaper e waste it that look makes it
look like it's lagging like it looks
like the app just didn't pull it up all
the way the
buttons like why and the bezel I guess
they're fine but this this looks like a
Nokia 99 from 2018 smaller than it
actually is this is comfy what you won't
get is four full years of software
upgrades like you do with the Samsung
but what you will get is a headphone
jack plus top shelf audio quality a
Micro SD card slot and even a physical
camera button which is pretty fun that's
fine but Samsung you can take pictures
using the volume button so it's kind of
irrelevant to have a physical camera
button in my opinion unless you can
remap it to something else this leads on
quite smoothly into the best battery
category because to be honest it is so
good here that you could well just call
it the xeria 5 Mark 5 again leave it at
that but I'm instead going to hand it to
a different Sony phone the xeria 10 Mark
5 simply because it keeps up one to one
with the battery life of the 5 Mark 5
but instead of being a $1,000 phone it's
a $400 phone now obviously other parts
of the phone are scaled back because of
that like the camera's a bit weaker and
the screen's a bit weaker but it's just
the fact that you can have this option
for insane battery life both in the
thank goodness for custom software like
Microsoft launcher or something because
I I just wouldn't want to use stockish
Android looks like Samsung's just you
know spiled it for me Flagship
configuration and also in the mid-range
configuration that is something that I
want to see more of and yes the naming
convention is incredibly poor yeah son
fire whoever named their
phones
like Mark five if I asked went down the
street and asked someone hey get your
name get your name uh iPhone for me
right they be like iPhone one two three
four right if I ask someone may name a
Samsung maybe they name it they may be
like oh the flip the fold right I name
ask someone at school and said hey name
a Sony phone um I don't think they
could I don't think that someone could
name a only
phone I test that out these these names
absolutely terrible you should never
have a situation where the 10 mark five
is lower end than the five mark five now
they look like
batteries 10 vol 5 Vol and you really
shouldn't be calling phones five Mark 5
in the first place but the products the
products speak for themselves so good
job sir I wonder if this going to have a
a six mark five a seven mark five and
what would happen when the five mark
five comes to its 10th Generation of
cellular technology are they going to
skip 10 and go to
11 this isn't the very sustainable Ming
convention maybe maybe when this gets
said they they'll call it the X the
which then if they call it the x mark 5
that would be
15 yeah so they should probably stop the
name convention can this one's yours and
on the subject of less major companies
who are managing to both keep up and
sometimes even out oh let's do a um
score check right now so right now it's
one win for one plus two wins for Sony
the big players I think it's time we
talk about the most improved phone of
the year because it's not well I mean
theoretically I can make anything just
make a piece of junk right and make a
less is piece of junk and that would be
the most improved phone of the year
that's so I could just win this
everywhere from Apple or Samsung the big
players as a very general rule they're
in a position where they're already
making great phones that are selling in
large quantities so they're in a
position where they don't really need to
or particularly want to mix things up
very much but you know who really did
genuinely Motorola and I know it's kind
of weird to treat Motorola like a small
player given that they're the makers of
still to this date one of the best
selling phones of all time but that time
is not now the companies felt like they
were past their Peak and kind of ready
to dip out of the market at any point
for years now that's how I felt until I
saw and used the Motorola Edge 30 Ultra
I was I was kind I kind of wanted a
Motorola
uh um what kind of white a motorer
edge 2022 too plus has stylus uh
selection you can has a DEX like feature
has teleph Zoom it's got a 144 HZ
refresh rate OLED screen it's got a 200
megapixel camera a high-end Snapdragon
chip 125 wat turbocharging the list goes
on but see this is what I would also
call this design is kind of weird though
the company's first ever ultraone and
that's normally red flags all around
because truth be told it's very hard to
compete with the software support and
the Camera Tuning and the battery
optimization that companies like Samsung
offer at that Flagship price point but I
think motor is well aware of this and
what makes this such an interesting
option is that it looks not not that I
would really care and it does stand out
is it just looks dull but I do like that
coding they've priced the edge3 ultra
accordingly while with most Flagship
phones you'd be expected to pay $1,000
to $1,200 for this you can quite easily
find it for 700 sometimes less and that
very much brings it into the picture so
the most improved award goes to this
unexpected champ if Motorola can now
just sort their camera image processing
they could kill it all right so now just
before we bring this together and we
pick the best overall phones for Budget
mid-range and Flagship let's talk best
gaming phone best camera so I can
definitely feel the Winds of Change when
it comes to gaming on a smartphone it
felt like the concept was massive in the
early smartphone days fueled by nauy
then it pet it out for a long time cuz
well mobile game companies realized they
could earn more profit making games like
this instead of making games like this
but that feels like it's changing now
that phones are reaching that critical
mass of power to actually just be able
to straight up play console games it all
of a sudden becomes very easy to bring
actually good quality titles to FMS
because yes but how would you monetize
that like I don't know how many people
would pay $50 for a mobile application
that's how much console G games cost
correct so let say they brought say I
don't know Madden over to an iPhone how
much does Madden
cost how much
is let's see Madden
24 is $34 yeah who's going to pay $34
for a mobile uh application those games
have already been made for other
platforms all of this is to say that
there's a pretty strong case for gaming
phones right now and if you're in the
market for one I would say there's three
top contenders the red magic 8s Pro
which almost makes too much sense in a
lot of ways because you're essentially I
kind of like that design like you just
stand that up on its side and start
recording getting the most densely
specked phone possible it also looks
like a piece of titanium more for an
upper mid-range price it's just missing
a few quality of life features like
water resistance and wireless charging
but mostly this whole invisible selfie
camera thing well it looks cool it
really does look cool it performs at
absolutely terribly and so that leaves
us with Asus Asus makes two gaming
phones they make the Rog Phone 7 and the
Rog Phone 7 Ultimate both with top shelf
performance both with stupendous battery
life and also both with a ecosystem of
accessories that genuinely makes them
feel like a lot more than just I just
don't really get the concept of why
would you want a gaming phone or say a
normal like flagship phone like you can
just buy a case that supports the
cooling that you
need a phone that can game and you would
think well if you're going to go that
extreme you might as well just go all in
on the ultimate but this is one of the
few cases where that's not the case the
ultimate is over $200 more expensive
than the Basse phone for little things
like a little vent at the back that
opens to let air inside the phone and a
second OLED rear display it's very cool
but it's just like DK it's $100 for a
vent and $100 for a screen and the
screen is not even useful like the X me
uh 11 an ultra where you could see the
time
and the camera if you're taking a
picture of someone I believe the last
thing that I'd want to be wasting my
battery on which leads us to gaming
phone of the year the Asus Rog Phone 7
but if I had to guess the single
question that I get asked the most about
phones these days it's not about gaming
phones or compact phones or battery
phones it's this which phone which phone
can repair cats currently has the best
camera it feels like that's become the
platform on which all of these companies
are competing now thanks Milo well the
boring answer is it's subjective I know
people who are really attached to iPhone
cameras I know people who swear by
obviously the Galaxy km Samsung cameras
I know people who are still using Hua
alwayss because they insist that that
takes photos in the way that they most
like so me saying that one of them is
just outright the best for you is a bit
like me saying blue is better than
Orange as true as that may be but as for
what's been the best for me it's got to
be the iPhone 15 Pro Max and there's
three reasons one is that Zoom has
always felt like it's been lacking on
iPhones and this it's for him but like
if you think about it you can find the
add external mics you have the five time
zoom camera you have USBC support it's
just all of that kind of like helps the
camera well not the best zoom you can
get it no longer makes me feel that way
the new five-time zoom camera has
actually come in handy so much more than
I expected it to whether I'm on a bullet
train in Japan and I want to get a
closeup of Mount Fuji or I find a really
interestingly lit Alleyway and the five
times allows someone on the other side
of it to get this really cinematic
closeup of meat that is such a real
scenario so real in it the second thing
is that it now shoots photos in 24
megapixel as opposed to the base 12 that
most phones shoot at it doesn't make the
photos twice as good and it is a I can
shootting 50rs bit of a bummer that
social media programs like Twitter and
insta they compress your shots to the
point where it doesn't really matter
when you just posting the raw photo
you've taken but the beauty comes with
the ability to crop in to centralize the
subject for example after having taken
the shot without feeling like you're
giving up quality to do it and then the
third thing is this ability to convert
any photo you've taken of a person into
a portrait mode shot other phones can do
this too like you can do it on a Samsung
but from my experience it's not as good
as it is here and
I use this so much now pretty much every
photo I've taken of me that I'm proud of
I'll test adding in the portrait effect
and 80% of the time I keep it on and if
you're enjoying this video then a lot of
effort goes into testing every single
phone on this table so a sub to the
channel would be rewarding so when it
comes to budget phones the things that I
tend to look for are actually very
different to those of more expensive
offerings you know how we talk about
this idea nowadays that specs don't
matter that everything's a software
battle and while that is very true at
the the upper end on specs do matter to
me but lower end specs are often the
limiting factor you need a certain level
of hardware for the software to just be
able to run with it and so while with
more expensive phones I tend to wait
things like user experience and level of
bloatware and Camera image processing on
the cheaper end you basically just want
to get as much good core Hardware in
place as possible and there's one phone
that I feel like has picked the best
things to prioritize here the Poco X5
Pro things like the chipset the
Snapdragon 778 G which is really good
for both performance and battery life
things like the screen which honestly
for anyone but the most hardcore I like
the screen aspect ratio reminds me of
the Galaxy a 7152 that I used to have
but what is on this screen we need to go
over this okay so it looks like we have
some weird browser here the Google
messages icon seemingly hasn't updated
and you have that stock my apps that's
fine like I'm okay with pre-installed my
apps or not my apps like that but like
Samsung apps like Samsung email I use
that and
Gmail I just like having the choice of I
use Samsung Notes don't really use keep
Samsung calendar Etc or techies will
most likely feel Flagship even the
camera is a very respectable 100 that is
such a waste of
space why an 8 megapixel sensor that if
someone handed to me and said use this
instead of your iPhone 15 Pro or your
Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra camera for a
few weeks I would have no real issue
with it because I know that with a very
little bit of editing I can get very
close to the best phones out there this
is one thing that xiaomi and their
spin-off Brands redney and Poco they
just they do it right but as you start
to creep up to the mid-range category
you can be a little fussier you can
decide well you know what I want my
camera to have really powerful image
processing or I want my phone to have an
aluminum frame instead of plastic or
wireless charging and the fact that all
phones in this category tend to have
those luxuries it makes this one tougher
I was very strongly considering the
Galaxy s23 Fe Samsung's Fe Series in
general it seems that the company's way
of Shifting the extra parts inventory
they have because there always a bit of
a mismatch of Parts seen in previous
phones and usually that's fine I mean in
a lot of ways the s23 Fe is like the
normal s23 but just with a much larger
battery yeah basically the problem
though in this case is the chip instead
of shipping the phone with something
fairly current Dave decided to chip it
with the exos 2200 which is a nearly
2-year-old chip that was that's so weird
why would you do that it's basically
like a
S21 Fe with updated cameras still not
the fastest or most efficient chip I'm
by time that byy the actual chip in
Destiny I even then and when you're
charging $600 it doesn't feel like that
instant recommend that some past f
phones have been Galaxy
a54 there's only been three past Fe
phones and one of them was only sold in
South Korea so it's not like the Fe
brand is
anything
like has pedigree to go off of is really
good too it's a tier below but it's
arguably much better value for money
because it is significantly cheaper well
you know what I really liked the nothing
phone 2 I was so close to giving the
award to this phone cuz it's just a cool
phone with really subtle thoughtful
design choices like the beautiful
animations the way the glyph interface
allows you to tune out of your digital
life for a bit the completely even
screen borders all around all without
sacrificing on the specs the only reason
I didn't pick it is because I think the
winner of this category is even better
though this xiaomi's redmi note 13 Pro
Plus which is actually just crazy I'll
link did they
hire
uh who's Sony's Nam
because like honestly that's better Nam
than five mark five but they must all
meet together at some same club or
something full video where we covered
this down below but this one's out of
the picture for now just because they
haven't launched internationally yet and
finally the base Google pixel flagships
usually also have a space here but the
price hike they've had this year has
kind of pushed the base pixel 8 out of
what I would call mid-range territory
which leaves us with the winning phone
the pixel 7 a and holding it like this
reminds me how cool these crystallized
trophies are CU you can actually see
both the home screen and through them to
the back of the phone now sure there are
a couple of slight caveats like the
charging is a bit slow but I like the
pixel 78 what is it with this have
update the M largely speaking this phone
when you're using it day today it feels
like it has no real weak link it takes
awesome photos it has full ACC well it's
for the fact that it's like small slow
charging
[Music]
um no Zoom so like you know it's still a
midate just for the Google pixel editing
Suite which is world class good stereo
speakers up-to-date ports and
connectivity and the up toate ports best
part is the price the phone launched at
$500 at which point I probably just Veer
towards the nothing phone but the thing
with pixels which is usually a bad thing
but in this case kind of has a silver
lining is that the price Falls very
quickly so I've seen these things now
for closer to $400 with the pixel
earphones included and closer to 350
without and at that price this is just
so much phone for the money and very
deserving of mid-range phone of the year
and now just before the winner we should
talk losers so there's two phones that
are going to be handing out The Wooden
Spoon Awards too I wonder if the
companies contact them for The Wooden
Spoon award if they'll if he'll give it
to them the first is the iPhone
SE we were talking about that today you
in the
episode this is not going to stand is it
do you know
[Music]
what and while this phone wasn't
technically launched this year the way
Apple Works it's still very much part of
their current lineup like it hasn't been
replaced and it's still being sold for
that full fat $429 price point well yeah
Apple's not going to get Apple's not
going to be selling phones for $200 I
mean they were ton as the brand they
look like cheap little they launched
that it's got an older chipset a weaker
camera very poor screen and Battery do
you know what I don't think there's a
person on this planet for which this at
its current price is actually the right
phone for think I very well family's
first pick of phone for kids and then
the second award is the go Google pixel
fold and I should be clear here I'm glad
that Google entered the space and the
pixel fold it also does do some really
good useful Innovative things on the
software Ed but the hardware it's just
not it like when you pull up what
Samsung's current it looks
like I know the bezels are like but
why it just looks like you got two
pieces of plastic stuck a screen on it
and said hey okay this is our phone it
looks like a
prototype foldables look like or the
OnePlus open this genuinely looks like
some Shel prototype from 5 years ago
that got accidentally released like
those bezels and that crease for this
price is quite disappointing I think
this phone exists more as a proof of
concept a way to show other Android
makers how to make foldable software as
opposed to a consumer product that's
actually competitive and viable it just
doesn't sit quite right with me that for
the price of one of these you can
literally get yourself like 6 and a half
Poco X5 Pros anyways this is what you've
been waiting for what is the best
flagship phone phone of the Year 2023
well there's a lot of good ones there's
the Samsung s23 Series xiaomi 13 series
there's the iPhone 15 the Vivo phones
which always have awesome cameras the
Oppo findex 6 the Sony phones the
OnePlus flagships which while not the
Trailblazers they used to be have fallen
into a nice niche of affordable quality
Flagship the issue we're having though
goodness this is heavy is that so many
of the Chinese companies they have
struggled to break into the Western
markets to the point where some of them
now they're actively pulling out and
actually trying to get one in a way that
doesn't involve just ebaying it and
potentially losing your warranty
starting to become a bit of a chore like
obviously there's the whole Huawei
situation it's always CH for me to go
out on my weekly VI buying spre most
people those phones are completely off
the table but also now Vivo are really
hard to get Oppo their latest Flagship
love this phone I think it's so stylish
and the camera was awesome they had
unlike last year's no European launch
this is China only and the other day I
was even looking up Shi we covered their
13 Ultra earlier this year and I love
that phone but does the UK store
actually sell it no you can buy the 13
you can buy the 13 Pro you can't
actually buy the ultra cuz I guess they
just decided it wasn't worth it for them
to release it here but then it gets even
more difficult because as a tech person
I'm fully aware that a couple of months
ago this company announced their next
jeton sh 14 series of phones but because
the Western markets have been such a
challenge for them they've developed
this sort of dual launch strategy where
China gets it at one point and then the
Western Market gets it 4 months later
and so in the UK and many parts of the
world xiaomi genuinely acts like this
next gen 14 does not exist whereas me
knowing the 14 exists and having seen
the potential improvements it can bring
would find it quite strange to now
recommend you buy the 13 what I'm trying
to get to is that in Western markets at
least it kind of feels like the number
number of viable options are drying up
and what you're left with if you
actually want a full warranty and you
want to buy kind of weird him being in
the UK because he actually sees those
phones sometimes sh me never releases
here in the United States unless you
kind one plus I guess phone from a
company that actually has a physical
presence is Apple Samsung and in some
places the Google pixel now while that
is sad since I do think companies like
xiaomi and Vivo and Huawei are driving a
lot of the hardware Innovation right now
it's also not like we're missing all the
best options because honestly the
Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra is for the most
part a master class it's probably the
biggest box ticker to ever exist you
want lots of cameras and lots of good
cameras check you want a top-of-the-line
screen check you want continuous
software support check you want to be
able to customize it to your heart's
content check honestly I've only just
recently delved into the Samsung
goodlock sweet of apps and the options
it gives you are genuinely staggering my
only complaint is the graininess that
you you can get in video as you start to
get into lower light but even with that
I do think the s23 ultra does enough
right to earn itself a title of
smartphone of the year but why does it
look like that it doesn't sit there on
its own there's one more phone the
iPhone 15 Pro Max also deserves to share
this position mostly for the camera
improvements shoot it with your Espin
shoot it with the s pin we talked about
earlier I literally noticed them every
single time I hit that shutter button
but also the better battery versus the
14 and the USBC which gives me one well
yeah it's not best phone improved it's
best phone of the
Year
whatever less cable to worry
about and before you think about
switching phone I want to show you why I
recommend you switch your browser to
because they PID you money all right so
yeah that was a good video from Mr who
boss what do you guys think about that
um
let's see what else is in the tech news
it's been kind of a slowest Tech news
week apart from the beoo thing people
have been asking what's it
called
grock grock AI from
X um things I guess we can talk about AI
again which is most definitely not
satanic monic okay so there's that yeah
you heard he F
folks Co AI also seems to be a lot more
free like it it doesn't look like
it cus as much say chat GPT and by
virtue Bing chat and then Google B
speaking of Google B Google launched
their um AI new
AI
service in a staged video that's
interesting oh GTA 6 came out don't
really know what that is I think it's a
game let me see if this reaction would
be good for with a
channel yeah apparently GTA 6 is a game
we I just drive
around do
stuff let me switch the
transcript
interesting all
right um well if no one comes through
today um that's all we have for
now so let me just check to see if any's
in the chat no okay God bless Tech talk
to you later pray for the
nation</pre>
