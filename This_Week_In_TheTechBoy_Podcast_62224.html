<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 62224</h1>
<pre>to the tech boy This Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast yeah today so we some
new all right we go so we got some new
Bible application uh
uh yeah so we got this new Bible
application I want to talk about it's
not new but it's new to me but also
going talk about how reacting to how by
PC in uh
1993 and there's also another video from
this it's not a channel it's a TV series
it's not uploaded to YouTube called
um computer Chronicles and I actually
like the 2001 PDA episode they show
people using Palm Pilots as computers um
but let's first get to the most
important part of the show Christianity
all right so as you guys can see here
from my
uh folder I created here we got the god
Quest and mobile application the Bible
app and then the Blue app this in called
Life Bible now the I like my Bible app
but I was just searching through trying
to see because as you guys know of these
things I'm sure it's called sword drill
so you basically take a Bible and oh my
name's on here something covered it up
you take a Bible and they'll call out a
verse and you have to go search to it
right so I was thinking that has to be a
fast way a faster Bible app than the
huers Bible app um on Android and I
found this other app called
uh oh okay I thought I said NLT okay
anyway this this Bible app on here
called Life Bible I was wondering if it
would be faster to flick through it and
it it's basically the same whatever but
I do like this feature called touch
points so as you guys can see here on
the screen called touch point it will
find it's in beta uh you can find all
the subjects that you want to talk about
my camera is reversed let me see if I
can fix
that there you go all right so as you
guys can see on the
screen you have all these topics
anything that anyone might want to know
so it's kind of like got questions and
you click it on here so let's click uh
uh adversity right and then I'll give
you this thing uh this blobe of text
about adversity troubles come of
multitude of names accidents afflictions
Beav calamities difficulties
disappointments wow they put this in the
alphabetical order so they go through
this thing about adversity and then
there'll be some questions on here like
uh oh does an auto score function to
does God actually send adversity into my
life don't troubles just happen and you
can read the response to that
um with some Bible vers so when I click
on that it will give me the Bible verse
Deuteronomy 2820 the Lord himself will
send you on curses confusion and
frustration doing evil and abandoning me
and it will start Auto scrolling really
slowly um just
fear and then it'll find some other
Bible verses and then some paragraphs to
summarize it so that's a really useful
feature so let's go find another thing
let's say
um Bible okay so it tells us a little
bli about the Bible how it's God's word
communicating with us several centuries
God inspires people to you basic truth
stuff you facts about the Bible and then
you can have some questions here has
like can I trust the Bible how often
should you read it promises from God um
so and then you there's also a search
barall in here so if I want to search
something in here let's say
um I don't know what's a Christian topic
people want to know chat what do you
have to
say there's no chat yet so I'm GNA just
say
um let's say Church how often did you go
to church
so I type in church you get a question
and then you get different questions
about denominations why should you be
involved what's my role what kind of
things you should do I'm just going to
cure um and then you'll get more
questions for it so it's really useful
um I haven't seen if it works offline
yet um speaking of offline capabilities
let's move into Leila AI so Lea AI we
reviewed that back in November no
January now we have an AI capable phone
and I I think it's better it seems a lot
faster on here but it has recently
gotten a new application um on here now
um unfortunately it does seem to still
have some of the censorship as some uh
AI do but now Lea AI can now chap into
chat gbt and Claude AI uh online of
course and it still has the offline
capabilities you now have these Min
applications so you can uh add
background inflence so switch apps on L
is thinking oh I need to add that um
so you can it will generate stuff in the
background so that sounds great um lce
toolkit they now have a cloud AI section
image recognition and then some you can
play chest against your characters so
there's like so much more you can do in
here has many miniature micro apps in
here and you can also show the amount of
cores and RAM that's it's using right
now so lat AI used about three to four
gab of ram so phone like this is you
know obviously capable for it
and it also tell you how many seconds it
takes in load J so nice little overall
update to Lela AI only $15 no
subscription cost at all all right and
the reason I've been getting into uh
sort of retro
Computing um
is uh I want to know what we can do with
these these powerful devices right um
that's not just browsing the web and
using internet right so when you go back
to a time before people were always
using the internet for everything right
um you'll see more of what they did and
they see some database processing word
processing etc etc but before we get
into this there's a very important thing
that's coming up uh uh on Capitol Hill I
think um the
surgeon
uh right let me let me pull up the news
article
here that's crazy all right
um so this is just an opinion article
hopefully you can see it on the
screen uh I'm going to take off my sound
video uh
oh go I'm gon to add a screen share here
we
go social media needs first thinking not
warning label so this is in response to
uh this is in response to the
uh Surgeon General Mr VC mty saying that
uh social media application should have
a regulation on them calling for
Congress to slap a health warning labels
on social media apps you might be
thinking that's crazy but let me tell
you how bad this really is okay first of
all I look this up the average date of
Congress is about 58 to 64 years old
House and Senate right I really really
would like to see a bunch of
60-year-olds try to Define social media
second of all the harmful effects I mean
it's only existed for like 20 years so
it's not like you can have harmful
effects study on something that fast
like it's like one generation of people
you got to see how the teens are
progressing through social media uh into
into adulthood right but let's get to
back to the defining social media I
really like to see them Define social
media because if you if you make it too
narrow then any plat for can uh say that
they're not a social media site and get
out of it but if you make it too wide
you you run the risk of literally
calling SMS social media let's go let's
go through this okay so traditional
social media platforms like Facebook
right well maybe to get around the law
of like putting a stupid warning label
on them because then people aren't going
to want to use it like cigarettes have
gone down because the warning labels
which is a good thing but you put a
warning want say Facebook maybe people
aren't going to want to use it as much
which will you know cause Revenue to go
down
um Facebook can say hey hey hey we're
not social media we're a live streaming
platform and technically yeah they are I
mean they do allow live streams right
and YouTube is not social media we've
gone through that you can go check all
my articles on that before all right but
let's say Discord discord's not social
media but I mean it's a chat application
some people consider Snapchat to be
social media but what's the difference
between slack Snapchat and Discord
nothing like Snapchat has like swipy
videos but so does YouTube but
Snapchat's main function and feature is
a chatting application right chat over
Wi-Fi if you guys consider social if you
guys consider Snapchat um social media
that RCS text thing which is going to be
baked into every Android iOS phone from
now on an iMessage it would be by
definition considered social media which
which is insane like do you guys want to
see a warning label every time you open
your texting app I don't think so
Instagram right some people use it to
post pictures right social media right
but some people use it as a messaging
platform do you guys really want to no
and then and then if you try to Define
social media as any website that allows
interactive content then the tech booy
has social media on its own site because
we allow comments but if if we allow if
we cast the definition as social media
any site that allows comments or just
any non a non-static site an interactive
website that allows usually generated
content then literally every website in
existence would have this stupid warning
label on it Microsoft start the New York
Times the New York Post the all of all
comments on them right Microsoft Edge
you load up Microsoft Edge you see all
those news articles from all those
random companies I guess they pay for ad
space too right you go into and then you
see Microsoft St they have uploades and
downlo speaking of uploades and down
votes red red it's not social media it's
like like a site that hosts multiple
fors right um X which used to be a
social media now it's moving into a Blog
and streaming platform right we're live
streaming to it
now I mean half the websites in
existence and most of the apps that
allow interactive content that you can
share with
people by this definition would be
social media but then if you make it too
narrow then the stupid warning label is
silly and also this the but this is too
trying to do is trying to get a a
definition of social media which is
going to take ages and by that
time it's it's going to change right and
let's just say hypothetically that
there's uh uh that they somehow come
together um they they they Define what
social media is right and they they get
enough votes to pass and it gets signed
right well now that they have enough
votes to Define what social media is and
they's say that they ban it for people
under 16 which is no possible but this's
is say this play the hypothetical right
do you guys really think this is going
to protect American social media
companies or uh meta uh Snapchat which
isn't social media but we're just
including them there no the only thing
that these bands and labels are going to
do they're not going to protect kids
from the allerg threat that social media
no what they're going to do is they're
going to Bo to VPN companies that kids
would then use and these won't be the
most rable VPN right they're not going
be buying reputable VPN from uh Nord or
vast or whatever you see uh Express
right know they're gonna be going into
the play store they're going to go going
into the App Store especially with the
EU now opening up iPhones uh they're
going to go into these stores and
they're going to say hey look here's a
free VPN and you do know what's GNA
happen all their data is not going to be
sent to China or whoever makes the VPN
some scammy company North Korea or
Russia which is worse than it going to
an American or EU uh North American
company objectively right and second of
all other social media platforms are
going to rise that aren't based in the
United States and will stay for
Innovation like Tik Tok
or uh let's say Tik Tok right they they
put on this little sticker thing on it
while kids didn't use their vpns or they
changed the IP addresses to go to Canada
or Mexico or any other company doesn't
have these laws right and Tik Tok is not
going to care they're not going to be
checking not going to be like Hardware
locking IP addressing device identifiers
they're not going to care at all they're
just going to do the bare minimum
because it's in their best interest
right they're G and let say other
Russian social media sites right they're
gonna become more popular and I would
rather our data be sent to meta in
Google then our data be sent to bite
dance and whoever else is out there
Yandex right um people who propose a Tik
Tok ban or against a Tik Tok ban which I
personally am against because of this
problem
right people who are against
it who say like well
see you're you're scared of Tik Tok
spying on you but you're not scared of
Google spying on you exactly I trust
American companies more than I trust
other companies I mean it makes more
sense my opinion so yes I'd rather have
Google quote unquote spy on me I'd
rather have LG quote unquote spy on me
um I'd rather have American allied five
I comp uh countries so like New Zealand
uh maybe some EU companies uh
Canada Australia South Korea I would
have those companies qu by me then i'
have Russia China North Korea or hostile
countries to the United States right I'd
rather have those I'd rather have my
data in American and EU silos than I
would in Chinese and Russian silos it's
simple as that right but that's all I
have to say about the social media
attempted bands age verifications which
is terrible like age verification does
not work on things that should not be
age verified right like if you want to
age verify illegal or elicit content
fine right I I'd be in favor of
Banning elicit content from the internet
I'd also be in favor of making trying to
bypass the age restrictions legal but I
would not be in favor of trying to make
bypassing age restrictions on like
Instagram or Tik Tok uh illegal let's
say in Montana it's like a $10,000
finding for kids not for kids but uh to
Tik Tok if they allow content access
right it's fair for the owners to be on
Tik Tok and all on kids because we don't
want a whole bunch of kids trying to
access quote unquote illegal t uh
content when it's just like innocent ish
Tik Tok
videos uh going going to jail and having
to pay funds right that that that
wouldn't be good we wouldn't want to
have like mass jings of ging kits all
right now we have how to re to buy a PC
oh and speaking of social media I have
the world's best ad to show you created
by the tech boy on my phone which you
will get to after our reaction videos
now um speaking of making things on my
phone we got the Galaxy s24 Ultra in
studio today
and the battery life I don't know how to
say it it's abysmal it's atosis we got
five hours screen on time on this one
which say hey that's good that's barely
enough for using this this phone right
not on carry or anything would be like
1,200 or
1,300 for the extra
storage right I expect this phone to
last okay okay I know how to use an S
Pen I expect this phone the last two
days with say four hours of screen
according to the dox max um Mark score
with four hours of screen on time is to
last 56 hours so that's about two and a
half days that is good my phone here can
last with like the regular settings on
Al the best screen adaptive power
setting uh Sav right the regular power
saving uh settings
on it will last from say 12
to like
seven with four five hour screen on
time that is not
acceptable at
all okay let's say I get up at six
o'clock every morning right this phone
should last from 600 to 6 with medium to
heavy usage and I'm not talking about
intentive gaming or anything on here I'm
talking about like YouTube basically in
the background with the pp screen okay
not full screen I'm talking about like
web browsing and everything right so
here's what I did I put the phone into
power saving light mode right so it
optimizes efficiency and uh over
performance which is fine and I set the
screen to HD not HD sorry fhd not HD and
then uh I put it back in the dark mode
and also the brightness has been
decreased by
10% I expecting this phone when I charge
it up tomorrow I go to church and
everything is well I get up at 6:00 in
the morning I use it why I hav't been
using this laptop it's t for streaming
because it's kind of slow and hinges are
broken I expect this thing I get up I
take it off the charger all right
without its case I will have the case on
to protect it which the case is good
though it's getting very smudgy like
with oil touching it just s up there I
use it normally right take some notes
maybe take some pictures do some
research use my co-pilot AI
um 60% when I go to bed or not maybe 40
right I'm expecting one one and a half
day battery life four hours each screen
I mean that's only acceptable right this
thing should be a laptop is a laptop
replacement I use everything on here
right when I plug into my monitor it
drains slower because it gets some of
the power from the monitor though it
outputs more power so it drains a little
bit
slower this thing should be able to last
me a whole day without D 12 to 7 is not
a whole day unless you're Apple Apple's
the only company you can be like all day
B of your life and then say it's 18
hours 12 to 7 is 7 hour battery life
with not 7 hour screen on time that
that's
insane right 9 to
six that's not even 12 hours right it's
telling me that at full charge over the
last 12 hours which might might sound
good but that's not 12 hours screen on
because that would be six and six that'
be great that's just 12 hours of mixed
usage that's unacceptable that's not
good it's not like I'm even using this
phone hard hard I'm using a bit hard I
have lots of all right I'm usually
hitting eight caps of RAM and maybe have
TKS running on some things which makes
sense but I mean most of the time we
just have our widgets running we have it
set to you know notify me of new
messages coming in then we got uh we're
using Co AI a lot um of course we got a
image generating AI all of this is
online so it's not like on device AI uh
photo late for AA harpu um and then face
tune in some of the photo editing uh on
offline photo editing and then
um maybe some advention Odyssey episodes
some spin
usage that's
it and maybe like what's that game
crashy smashy Road what crashy road I
don't know what it's called um but
yeah but without further Ado let's go
back to 199 ow so 1993 so we're going to
be reacting to reacting to how to buy a
computer in
1993 so let's set the stage here 1993
the worldwide web had just come out
three years
ago I think netc Navigator was
like uh brand
new um most people haven't even used it
yet Windows Windows is a software I
believe uh you can still buy it as a
software
um this is a horrible gaming
experience YouTube Windows is a software
like
videos on on on on
things you'll see all right here we go I
wish I could switch to the left side
this looks better it will recommend me a
video that actually slaps that I'm like
okay all right I guess the algorithm can
continue spying on me it seems to be
working some of the time so I wanted to
share this video with you because it's
freaking hilarious for one but all right
so the computer Chronicles 4 42.1k
subscribers they now have uh a thousand
100 thousand that's also kind of
interesting it's basically an episode
from a really old TV series called the
computer Chronicles that started in like
the 1980s and I think ran all the way
till around 2002 which I which that that
is a good rent for a TV show but I I
wish they still did it now because it
seems like a most computer magazines I
like reading computer magazines on say
archive.org really good use of the spin
by the way
um back in the 90s they they get into
the computers right they they get into
what they could do what softwares they
can run but you look up a laptop review
now this just like I tested with battery
I played a
video maybe edited an image on a more
expensive laptop and that's it like it's
the same sad apps it's the same we got
Adobe we got
we got um I may we got Adobe we got
Chrome maybe some AI tools like what
that's kind of boring like with the
studens of AI I'm glad to see more on
device processing like I like to see the
oama scores say of the uh new Surface
cider arm PCS right I I like to see some
of those scores right I like to see what
what they can do right and also guys
make sure you go watch Juan
Bagnell um review of the surface hardw
we might react to some of that too but
make sure you guys can go watch and
support as uh Microsoft apparently
Microsoft and his bank apparently didn't
get the things to on time and algorithm
or something like that
uh what do we talk about oh yeah so we
need we need to go back to the
days of when like people expected the PC
to be used offline like you look up
right now what can you do on a PC
offline right without internet what can
you do on a laptop with internet the TP
the first top results top SE results
will be like oh you can delete some
files and uh and
type delete files and
type like really I I will type in here
um 20 things to do
on without
internet okay our top search result is
from Apartment Therapy oh wait no no
no that's
a let's called a Wiki okay I saw
something that said like listen to
Digital radio and stuff that's for SDR
but let's say we don't have an SDR okay
here we
go personalize your computer this is
some Wiki H organize your computer
program your computer uh with notepad
it's what they're showing here
apparently you don't have any software
on here and also they don't even tell
you what kind of programs to run clean
your computer draw in
paint listen to
music watch videos on a DVD drive write
a
story get familiarize with your computer
program sometimes you have programs that
you don't even know what they do so um
make a virtual
diary and put a password on it okay so
uh two of the things they have done is
literally typing five of the things is
cleaning up the computer yes guys
offline in 2024 you can drag some icons
around and
type oh what's the next thing become a
computer geek learn how the computer
works yeah uh they don't sell computers
with manuals anymore I doubt that just
typing random stuff in command prompt is
going to turn out well for you okay um
it won't work or you might do something
bad play a game like mind sweeper in
solit to oh that's decent 12 only had 12
things here so
um here we go let's go to Reddit this
from eight months ago so this is from
2023 ebooks
write a
diary learn how to use delirium okay
that's
useful okay
like the the stuff that the people are
encouraging here
is basically
useless but let's get back to
1993 which I never really watched
growing up U but I knew about it vaguely
and this episode specifically is from
1993 and it's called buying a new
computer so I thought it'd be absolutely
hysterical to see how far things have
come what's changed since then it's been
he look at these laptops look at the
bezels I mean look at these things these
are track bars to control not not even a
whole track
pad good almost 30 years since this was
filmed and I thought it still be better
than the Apple Magic Mouse because I
used that today went to Best Buy today
and it was I like what is this thing
what are you guys doing also be
interesting to see what stayed the same
what things haven't changed uh so I'm
just going to give some commentary it's
just going to be a stupid react video
hopefully you guys will get a kick out
of it there are definitely some really
amusing Parts here so I'm just going to
go ahead and play it and we'll jump
right in today's video is brought to you
by slick deals and there it's brought to
you by be brought to you by Samsung prob
literally within seconds I was finding
all kinds of offers like there was a be
stuff like computer hardware need I
continue if you like saving which is a
dumb thing awesome that YouTube has
these full episodes online let's
go iPhone 15 in a mouse
case 3 2
1 so you finally decided to buy a new
computer you go down to your local
computer store and what do you find a
zillion choices how do you so let's look
at all these computers I think that's an
apple look at the color logo I'm not
sure decide what to buy should it be a
Macintosh or a PC if it's a PC PC youy
guys out there go buy PCS see what brand
of PC and what kind of display how much
memory how big a hard drive should you
get a c this whole thing cuz it's a
reaction to a 26 minute video and on and
on and on today we'll help you so pretty
much that's
beautiful computer Chronicles oh yeah
this is funny this is funny in part by
Intel microprocessor technology for that
logo back when Intel's font was still
what is that thing back there if so to
switch I go like that's neat also I use
Google uh not Google Samsung bixby's
voice cloning tool this and then you can
have it talk back to you it
is it's not
is is provided by the software
Publishers Association providers of
educational materials to help manage
software don't copy that floppy
yes personal computer division don't
copy that floppy we need a we need an
updated phrase for for modern times
don't torrent it's abhorent I wonder how
long it took him to come up
fit HP still kicking welcome to the
computer Chronicles kind of funny like
they're L be sponsored by Intel and uh
HP which means in this time period yeah
it's G to be a Windows device cha and
with me today is Andy Reinhardt West
Coast bureau chief for bite magazine and
we have two computers here an IBM PC
compatible this is an HP Vectra a
Macintosh centrus over here they both
look pretty much alike the question I
get from someone who's buying a new
computer what should I buy a Macintosh
or a PC guys sit by PCS PCS are better
we got co- pilot we're gonna get recall
soon which uh for recall I understand
why they take it away though I'm a big
fan of it I was a major proponent of it
and when it comes back I'm I'm expecting
this okay so at least on the new
computers separate space allocated just
for recall okay um in order to use it no
no programs can access it from the
outside so remote desktop a team viewer
no internet programs coming in you have
that coming in what work that like lowle
screen sharing hacks or whatever
um everything's encrypted 512 bit like
one 256 I went down on 512 okay um and
you need Biometrics and a password to
put it in preferbly a password that's
not your Windows login password um
screen recording is blocked doing that
and if you try to it's Hardware locked
to the ID of your computer so if you
tried to transfer it to someone else's
computer it wouldn't
work
um One Touch deletion and then of course
time deletion so you can say uh like
they have on Google data storage you can
say after 18 months of my activity
delete six months my activity delete Etc
ETA it may be some inactivity so let's
say after six mons of inactivity this
will just automatically delete I think
that would be good features for that and
of course of course disable and
disabling certain applications maybe you
don't want it seeing your browser maybe
you don't want it
seeing your your your texts Etc how do
you answer that question easy I get
asked this question all the time it used
to be easier because the Mac was quite a
bit more expensive than the PC so it was
partly a question of what you could
afford but now the prices on Max have
come down so much that that that's
really not an issue did you see his eyes
he were like whoa happened here also his
uh headphones they don't
seem it doesn't seem like they're
working uh because it's up so I I guess
that's just for
sure
um that did not age well what you're
going to do with the system is often a
point that I suggest to people but in
fact the applications are about the same
for both the systems so I really think
what one kind of applications people be
running back then down is how much
computer expertise you have going into
it and if you're willing to get in there
and roll up your sleeves and kind of get
to know the system really well you can
still get some better deals on which is
fine but uh they are harder to use you
have to mess around with auto exact bat
and config sis files and dip switches
and jumpers and irqs and that sort of
thing which you don't have to dip
switches
iq's I I need to do some research on
that deal with at all anymore so even
less of a reason to go with Mac if uh
user friendliness is a big concern I
think with the Mac basically everything
works out of the box now of course
they're trying to correct that with the
PC with the plug andplay initiative but
that's not going to take they did they
fixed yep yep it's great you plug in it
plays want to depend on kind SLE going
through difference between Max and PC so
I pick PCS you Owen lender Holmes senior
editor of PC World magazine says
choosing a 486 processor now may sa look
at them the keyboard and that is
basically the same like I don't even
know why these keyboards are so small
this thing looks upgraded this thing
looks like a military machine also 1993
was when uh wayed in the windy city let
me see if I still have that I don't have
it well guys the black Chronicle Books I
think way in Windy City is from 1990 D
so these be the kind of laptops that uh
Mr whu and
Robert not Robert Mitchell uh what's his
name not Ryan mattlock he's he's a real
person
uh where's where's my book what's his
name I got I forgotten
uh Richard Maxwell yeah Richard Maxwell
uh would have
wiped so these are the kind kind of
laptops that you know they would be
using back in the
90s save you money in the long run
prices Dro so fast on them all the time
that you're be you're best off deciding
what you can afford now um and buying
the best notebook you can for that let's
look at the compies got we got Microsoft
and shba and if I called into shba split
into four different like divisions I
haven't seen a t sha laptop in a long
time I think we have one up there from
like 2009 comes with like Windows s on
it m that way it'll last a bit longer
shop at the low end it just means it'll
be obsolete all that much quicker that's
some pretty Universal advice I think
pretty yeah I mean U you you do that for
phones with the exception of some the
import like Poco phones and stuff like
that uh pixel A's which you know crept
into prices that people have demand
demand it more features you go down to
the local T-Mobile yeah go to like uh
a Best Buy and you see
like
the I forgot what to called oh
monoat Motorola Motorola phones right I
mean they're basically obsolute already
um yeah Timeless different models have
different kinds of input devices the
most common is a track ball mouse that
Clips onto the side of the unit it's
like a big version of the uh
ThinkPad but it's best to try several
different ones no wonder all of our
parents have arthritis and carpal tunnel
battery range is another important
feature to consider battery lives range
from about 3 to 6 hours which I mean you
think about 3 to six
hours that's still pretty good 3 to six
hours I'm assuming you mean screen on
time if you mean just like you charge it
up and it lasts six hours
that's that's criminal uh but 3 to six
hours of screen on time for a laptop you
take it somewhere that's pretty good in
my opinion um let's say 3 to six hours
screen on time so let's say uh you go to
work at 9:00 come home at
5: and you have if you have lots of
meetings maybe that's bad but you can
charge it up at
lunch um you can typically expect to get
what the the lower end of what a
manufacturer claims so if they say 3 to
5 hours you can expect three if they say
four to six you can expect four Shady
manufacturers man don't count anymore I
mean manufacturers like they say like 3
to five hours whatever the laptop screen
screen time is now um those are always
based on like a video playing all
connectivity off so like you downloaded
this video from the internet legally of
course um privacy is bad and then
you turn off all connection settings
it's basically like you're on an
airplane like airplane battery usage is
probably what people most accurate more
than that because the chances are you
won't get it if you need more than that
buy a spare battery keep it charged up
and then to swap it in when just hop
swap your laptop battery everyone's
doing it so yeah I mean how you charge a
separate battery that's the thing people
like hey yeah rle battery phones are so
great because you're can always have
another battery charged up for you it
sounds great it sounds great right
except for you know people take
batteries out with phones and they can
steal
them etc
etc but you take a battery out of phones
how are you supposed to charge the other
battery I I've never seen a removal
battery charge
before at least in in real life that
Samsung right there battery life was
pretty abysmal back then especially
considering just what the computers
could do but I mean for a laptop back
then in 1993 you probably couldn't spend
more than 3 hours on one anyway without
being like well I've done everything
this device is capable of doing and now
I'm I mean like I mean like Excel and W
and stuff like stuff like that is fun
but you just need the data to put it
into
going to go outside the internet doesn't
exist yet so there's still a reason to
see the Sun what you want your notebook
computer to do should determine how much
money you spend besides the internet
works outside Prices range from1 to
$5,000 that's crazy like nowadays Prices
range
from a 100 you can buy a Chromebook for
100 to um like I got a Chrome
book before I started the website and
Channel with 16 gigabytes of storage
Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 3 it's one
feature which that it could fold flat
180 degrees um and I spent all my time
trying to install Windows on I think of
course it didn't work
because it was a Chromebook with 16
gigabytes of storage
um anyway 1,000 to3 $5,000 that's
expensive like nowadays it's three to
say maybe $7,000 you can find a folding
laptop but the the major price range I'd
say is maybe uh 5 to 3,000 so $500 to
$3,000 and 3,000 is including like the
highest Top ofthe Line MacBook Pro with
the most storage in Ram at the 1,000
then we're talking of 386 2 megab of ram
what do you even get for a $5,000 laptop
today like that's just insane and for
$5,000 you might be able to get a gaming
laptop $5,000 is a lot for a laptop like
maybe a folding laptop doesn't is you
know back back then
um extra
storage
uh let's see in the S rgaming laptops uh
bash laptop for $5,000 with the thinness
sck
design yeah people already saying it's
overspeed it's it's uh I mean not overp
too much like the lovo legion 9i
according to this uh goes up with $4,500
has C accuracy 490 and water cooling
like really water cooling in a
laptop it starts they start at $1,000 I
mean nowadays $1,000 laptop is like a
solid it's like a solid laptop that's a
good mid-range option yeah $1,000 you
can find good op um options from last
year maybe some decent options from this
year um you can find like this surface
lap around a them today they look pretty
nice the keyboards and track pads are
good the touch pads not touch pads the
touch screens feel kind of you kind of
have to work for them in the AI features
they weren't there just yet like recall
wasn't installed on them yet of course
um C Viet I wish it worked offline on
those like you got the S exite chip on
there least install a rimary like that
that can do a lot but back then it was
like $1,000 and back then $1,000 was
closer to like between 1,500 and 2,000 I
would think let me see what the specs
are let's see what the specs are on a
$1,000 laptop prices range from1 to
$5,000 inflation today so that
is so so we'll be comparing these to say
like
uh uh the surface laptop Studio
here's some laptops under $2000 from
Best Buy
which their prices are always the best
so we got the Lenovo Legion 5i 16in
gaming
laptop uh
for9 okay the MacBook Pro 14 in 18
gigabyt memory and
52 oh that is
disgusting 18 gigs of RAM and only 512
gigaby of storage for
$2,000 okay what of ram 16 megabyte hard
drivey 16 did you say 16 megabytes of
ram sorry low end did he say two
megabytes of ram oh no he said two two
megabytes of ram now for comparison
um a Chrome
tab uses
uh one to two gigabytes of RAM for 15
tabs so um according to my handy dandy
calculator let's let's take a low
and
six I'm I'm gonna calculate 6 0 Z
06666 repeating
um and I'm GNA drop it into a gigabyte
computer so
um one Chrome tab uses about 66
megabytes of RAM so this thing could
even load an entire chrome tag okay um
for
context the amount of ram in an Apple
Watch 9 is a gigabyte so there's more
RAM in your Apple
watch
um the new Nintendo gaming watch uh
has 65 D I
know that that's the old
one that's not even in gigabytes or
whatever it's not it's not it's not
telling me how much RAM there's in there
but I'm pretty sure there's more RAM in
this calculator than there was in that
computer which it's honest like all the
stuff you can do with two megabytes of
RAM and I don't know how much storage
and processing these laptops have like
these things should be able to do
quantum
mechanics and like literally program a
Plane by themselves there's 12 gigabytes
of RAM in
distinc right it is almost unfathomable
to understand the leap from 12 gigabytes
from two megabytes to 12 gigabytes and
this thing is smaller and than the
laptop we need to start using more of
these things for Less web browsing more
productive things like I I had co-pilot
on here called me a projectile
simulation calculator for Nerf wars and
stuff like that right and I'm trying to
get a nice gii loaded up on today and
everything like that um maybe I'll turn
into an Android app but like we need to
be using more of these things offline
more power than this because like people
have to put up on two megabytes of ram
we're doing a lot more than what we do
with our current Computing technology
wow people always like what's the best
laptop oh just can type you can do the
internet and some Zoom calls and then
some people like maybe pay $2,000 who
you can game and Video Edit like that's
it that's that's sad screen will be
monochrome get
a that is sad
like if someone Tri to sell a monochrome
device in 2024 the only way they get
away with it is saying it's
privacy uh minimalistic like the new
light phone that just uh released
which let's get into
that the Light phone
3 it's on pre-order for $3.99 so
remember that 3.99 and it's unlikely
that you're going to see these on eBay
for um
less because no one's going to buy it
but here we go we got the Light phone
3 sorry my eyes must be broken because I
know they not trying to sell this piece
of brick for
$7.99 this you you guys see what this is
right it looks like an MP3
player and it will come January 2025
probably because they're handmaking the
three of them that they're going to
sell all right this is the pre-order of
the light I got
5G which um which is a good thing I
guess also um I'm pretty sure some of
their Bas is gonna be oh my gosh it has
5G I'm gonna get Co and I'm gonna be
like shut up all right um we got 5G we
got um and even this would be more
powerful than the laptop we got a camera
on it and fingerprint ID to protect the
uh well to protect something the that's
on the phone the really
important
picture that you have on there all right
you got a twostep shutter button wow I
mean you guys went all out I mean you
guys are the second coming of Sony a
two-step shutter button for the uh two
pictures that you're going to take on
this phone uh you got volume keys on
here a wheel for because TCH screens are
for people who like using technology
apparently uh got some speakers on here
which actually actually looks good and
you got a flashlight and a camera and
this thing got dual cameras people dual
cameras just like the uh oh what was
that Nokia n95 from 2006 all you got a
battery cover with some screws on here I
mean this is the phone of the Year let's
look at the specs here we got 4G and 5G
on here USBC 2.0 obviously not gonna be
outputting this to a display I mean what
you see okay what on Earth do you need
128 gigabytes of memory and 6 gigabytes
of RAM for
why what are you guys putting on there
it's a dialer
of it has less okay okay you got the
Qualcomm SM 450 no one's ever heard of
an ip54 for whenever you want to take
your phone with you somewhere so people
can show off uh those are the specs uh
what apps do you get
preinstalled all right so it's a simple
phone with a camera and some optional
tools available for $7.99 I will use
every tool y'all got an alarm a timer a
calculator a calendar a directory
Direction not and voice memo so does my
grandma's flip phone all right and a
simple music or podcast
player always optional never
pre-installed there is no music
streaming for $7.99 this thing for able
to make it own music uh no ways to use
other calling and messaging
applications just like it's 2007 but
they might
there's no Uber these might be possible
might but 799 these better be possible
the phone has GPS Bluetooth fingerprint
ID noise cancellation mic fast light
voice to text it can be used as a
personal
hotspot it has a NFC chip for maybe
using as a digital water I mean it might
support cards I mean it's a developers
you know if they think about it they
might be able to do it uh video calls uh
I'm not sure they're going to do video
calls unless you got T-Mobile to a
T-Mobile phone accessibility features
with a front facing
camera like what what accessibility
features they are much better and much
cheaper phones for
seniors and let's anyone else um it's
important to remember the features you
will never have you will never have
social media internet browsing email
news or ads there are simply no infinite
feeds it will have internet browsing
social media email and news if you want
it just download the APK it's not like
they made their own uh app uh software
and use a pre-order because you'll get
it half off because no one who's Saye
will buy that thing for
$800 all right um back to the video
sorry you'll getting that the highend
$5,000 uh laptop you're talking about
one with Max $5,000 is a lot of money
for a laptop that would be absolutely in
2000 like I doubt these things had
network connectivity it's color screen
really sharp and clear a dx250 or DX 266
processor yeah you guys got a whole
color screen which um honestly is
nice compared to some companies 128 for
every uh picture that you're going to
take 128 you don't even have apps what
are you going to do with the 120
display memory lots of hard drive space
maybe even six gig of RAM you can't even
split going on the thing like I mean the
specs are nice it's better than your
eting a piece of junk toy of a phone but
I mean you didn't need to bring it into
the AI age with six gigs of RAM and 128
gabt of storage for no
apps just 200 megabytes this is a
computer which should ride so not only
do you get the full color screen full
full color full color doesn't he look
like Kyle man from the babon
B for $5,000 you also get a large
capacity hard drive as much as 200
megabytes that's like 100 megabytes and
I was watching a M's deos video about
the PlayStation handhelds there's a
PlayStation handheld where you could
plug in this thing I think it's called a
super Drive something it's like from
2004 that thing was like 1.9 almost two
gigabytes for a game console that was
sold to kids like how many music CDs is
that it's like at least a third of one
for the computer Chronicles I'm J like
half a song you can put like in the wild
maybe a short BOS of the national anthem
on
thanks
Janelle the ninja thirsty drink system
is like having a drink aisle on your
countertop choose from over 2 like oh
yeah look at look at these things
speaking of see how this uh is typing
out on thing the new Adobe Express
update ruined that it ruined it so as
you guys know I film uh News videos for
school right the glory News Network as
it's referred to in
ssw um makes you guys check that out
we'll get to the blog post somay we have
really interesting blog post there and
hand gestures I guess um so for the GNN
as it's referred to uh in in the thing
obviously that's not the
real name I didn't actually go to
question uh that's not real school don't
go looking that up anyway uh as just for
today I always had Bible boers that
would type out onto the screen on
animation so they'll be like good
morning of the day is gen11 and genes
111 would type out on the screen that's
just saying in the beginning I created
Happ right um and I would make those
things I copy and paste the Bible First
from Bible app put it in animate it
unfortunately the new Adobe Express
update while does AD generative AI thank
you Adobe it took takes away some of
those animation features so I need to
find a new application for that so very
sad ad doing I actually put off updating
that until school it out and update it
when I switch over to the phone and
download the newest copy from the Play
Store back on eight still hyphenated the
word online that's crazy these graphics
and music are everything if you're
thinking about buying an IBM PC comp I
thought he was what was that present's
name Bush I thought that was him desktop
computer you have lots of decisions to
make here
to e
all
right uh I don't want to do that there
you go all right we are back over here
Lisa what kind of computer does he look
like with
who uh ma use your computer before you
can get to use it you've got to buy it I
want to ask you about buy how use your
computer basic rule about buying a new
pc before Google they had
books
true and they still have books now
really there's two issues to consider
there's what you're actually going to
buy and there's who you're going to buy
it from I kind of want to start with the
second I think one of the most important
things especially for people who are
buying their first PCS you don't want to
prioritize price too much I mean price
is important what you're really looking
for is a store that has a good
reputation and particularly a good
reputation for service and support you
don't want the PC to break a week later
and they don't remember your or even if
you can't figure something out you want
to be able to call somebody and say help
how do I do this that's right okay so
price isn't everything price is not what
about price isn't everything I mean it
is if you're on a budget like a normal
well person that that is true that is
true everyone can afford to shop at
Sears lady um at this point if I were
buying that's crazy a new pc I would buy
a 486 it's a 486 not a 386 that's right
if you're buying a used PC now I get a
586 you don't want those 486 from a 30
years ago my consider a 386 but a new
computer I'd buy a 486 okay what kind of
486 there's lots of different processors
you can get it really depends on what
you're trying to do if all you're doing
is word processing in SX may be
sufficient if you're doing a lot I mean
I guess that's what they all tell you
now if all you're doing is word
processing which I mean for a thousand
well not a thousand for the laptops but
I don't know how much they're selling
these for this just wood processing like
you back then you get a dedicated wood
processing like if all you're doing is
that I don't even know what you're
getting computer for but if you want you
know networking and stuff like that
maybe a better keyboard and yeah maybe
that's kind of an expense just for put
some words on a page a lot of different
applications at once and you're running
Windows and you're using databases or
graph oh yes because uh if you're
running Windows as in Windows is a
software that runs over the Dos
layer you're probably going to want a DX
or dx2 okay so you go for 486 how about
the memory question 2 Megs of ram 4 8 16
how do you know what you need and how
much you should two Megs of ram I'm
pretty sure some might have more RAM
than
that it depends on what you're doing um
if you're going to be using Windows and
almost all of us are going to have to be
using Windows whether we want to or not
you're we we want to or not yes because
everyone knows how much fun people had
just turning on a computer and coming to
a blinking command P GNA want at least
four megabytes don't let them sell you a
two oh and guys uh maybe if we have an
old computer we can install free Doss on
it actually there's one right there down
there maybe we can install free Doss on
it and see what we can do megabyte
machine for Windows so that's your
absolute minimum and that would really
don't you let them sell two megabyte
machines and let that be true to they
don't you let people sell you two
gigabyte machines not even four four is
four
is I bought the last of the four it was
a tablet that thing died but yeah for is
like decent for cheap
phones get it get it only be for
basically word processing and not a lot
more if you're going to be doing
database applications for example
Windows you're really talking for like
grades and stuff uh I guess people tap
in and change their grade as they doing
all the great movies fortunately
unfortunately SS ltw does not have any
great changing schemes
uh in there I guess we could fix the
lies
one I go in undercover and stop a great
changing scheme in the office just like
Emily and Koop bless be 16's nice eight
would be
wow I mean it's kind of crazy too that
still megab sort of debating even today
when it comes to system memory do we go
4 8 or 16 just like they were back then
but now it's gigabytes whereas back then
it was megabytes we're literally talking
about 1,00 times more capacity take a
look at an example we have a PC
compatible over here running Windows and
maybe you should move your mouse or
whatever so we can get something up on
the screen show me what happens if you
don't have enough memory in your machine
well let me just show you guys this is
this is this is what happens if you
don't have another Ram pay attention
we've got paranox for we got a database
app apparently we got some typing we got
Excel um solitier and program manager
speaking of word proof you guys want me
to buy that no uh mobile versions but
maybe we'll be able to imate it which is
a database application we've got word
perfect solitire uh and Excel all
happening had four apps open and one of
them
soliter their memory stress test they've
got Solitaire hold on not solitire step
aside crisis colored rectangles are
being rendered so we running five things
here right and what happens now now this
is an eight Meg machine right eight
whole megabytes I mean this this is like
middle of the line back then eight Meg
machine which is borderline for all this
stuff once and for especially for
database stuff so here we are and I'm
going to open launch a file and we wait
and this is this is because it's a
database application and there's too
little memory and too much going on I
mean it would be the same issue in
Access or other database applications
this just really is very
borderline so uh she really wants that
16 megabytes of ram oh Paradox is from
Coral so you got Coral Windows Microsoft
Computing over here wait wait access
access access and that's because not
enough R oh my gosh I mean thank God
Google Chrome didn't exist back then
just saying the words Google Chrome
would make the computer explode CPU also
that's right Google
Chrome see we got any comments here no
okay
all right you've got two keyboards here
let me ask you about this a lot of
people don't even think about touching
the keyboard when they buy their PC but
that's pretty important is it that's
what you touch oh wow guys guys you
don't touch the screen you touch the
keyboard like really you know it's funny
it seems trivial but it makes a really
big difference in how happy you're going
to be with what would the difference be
in these two keyboards you have here
well a lot of the difference is touch
and sound so this is a more standard
keyboard it's sort of softer touch not a
big click a little mushy and soft and
doesn't make a lot of noise this and
this is fair I was looking for USB
drives on here used standard now this is
more uh this is a lot like the original
IBM PC keyboard tends to be noisier and
um a little stiffer and it makes a click
when you press the keys the thing that's
nice about that um is you can really
tell when the keys are pressed it's it's
not a question in your mind so teac tile
it's nice to know that they they hated
membrane keyboards back then too it's
also a good reminder that mechanical
keyboards I mean at least they don't
have this thing doesn't have a space
bar around a lot longer than a lot of
people think moving over from
typewriters often like this
feel you imagine going see on an Amazon
product page for a mechanical keyboard
great for people coming from typewriters
do I feel young try out the keyboard
that's and old at the same try typing
yeah lastly real quickly what about the
display how much money should you spend
do you need SVGA do you need a real
classy display a fast card so on again
depends on what you're doing I think
Super VGA would be a good place to start
super VGA you want to see the monitor
running your application you don't want
to see it displaying beautiful
photographs you want to see it that's
right you want to see it doing not
exactly my word uh Netscape Navigator uh
all kinds of great softwares your
program than an equivalent okay Lisa
thank you very much I'm going to go over
here and join Wendy and Wendy I guess if
you're thinking about buying a new P
even if you're upgrading hold on does I
like how the lady just stares off into
space doing nothing even if you're up
okay Lisa thank you very much I'm going
to go over here and join Wendy and Wendy
I guess if you're thinking about buying
a new pc even if you're upgrading does
that I like how the lady just stares off
into space doing nothing while he goes
to talk to this chick just standing
there waiting for solitary to load okay
we're talking about multimedia PCS and
you have an example of a new multimedia
PC one might have bought here with lot
wow back then not all PCS were
necessarily capable of multimedia
features that's
something thing this thing looks like in
school goodon it tell me what's in here
and how important is multimedia that's
the big buzz word going multimedia a it
depends on whether you need your uh
system to bark at you I guess what like
I've never heard that phrase if you need
your system to bark at you are you guys
playing dog videos on there but this one
for example has a sound card in it it's
got speakers it's got a CD ROM drive hey
guys you know you can for a dog if you
touch it click with your
mouth your systems don't baring at you
what also got a video IM lady with that
best he's like yeah so this computer
really box at you person at you like
what I'm just looking for laptops and
slay over here you're talking about dogs
playback
board um what is that that's it plays
back movies 30 frames per second full
screen 30 frames per second
what it plays movies 30 FPS full screen
in glorious 480p I looked it up that's
actually the maximum resolution of super
VGA 480p
which would look like this in 720p there
we
go so without that board you might not
and probably more like that because uh
the screen would not be as wide as my
uh 13.3 like because it has the cap
coing over there so you wouldn't get
anything might not be a show us an
example run a a video for Windows Movie
here so we'll see what you're talking
about see let's see the goods give us
the the hot demo
dragon slay Dragon a game Adventure
that's pretty impressive stuff full
screen good sound Etc exactly that's not
automatically going to come with my PC
because bonus not at all in fact most
multimedia PCS come with merely a sound
card and CD ROM drive once you get into
so not even not even all PCS came with
CD ROM drives which I guess is the same
thing is now like you you can't even
find a laptop with a CD bom Drive nice
speakers that actually sound good you're
adding another another $500 to the price
$500 with some spus nowadays if you
tried to sell a laptop without
spus you yeah yeah know decompression
board you're adding another $400 or $500
so total it's another $1,000 so think
about whether that ,000 you know just to
watch some TV that's not even live th
bucks is really going to to play Dragon
Slayer if just games it's probably not
worth it h exactly okay thank you Wendy
for many computer Shoppers the EAS way
to buy a new pc is by mail order either
directly from the manufacturer or
through one of we don't need to you know
watch this cuz that Amazon exist it all
out we've listed all the specs you
should look for all right so now let's
go into the uh the channel which is
called computer
Chronicles and while we're waiting for
that to load up let's go to Let's Go
full screen all right now it's time for
the greatest most powerful ad of all
time
so let's go over to our the techboy
um the techboy YouTube channel and it's
watch this ad here I mean this is it it
is truly beautiful to
me yeah it it
is I I'd say I'd say it's the ad of Our
Generation like this this ad
I'm trying to pause it here all right
here we go hope you guys can see this on
this screen and this this is this is
this is great all right here we
go and these transitions were all done
in uh motion
ninja oh did you see that did you see
that tone and then we got swiping skull
in here oh this is
great and we got the C on here we got a
properly on our OnePlus uh OnePlus phone
here um we got our screenshot on
here we got our animation that was done
in the derby Express and this is also
done the music and the music Graphics
all done in most so make sure go check
it out notth boy.com go join all right
um let's go to the computer
Chronicles and then we're going to talk
about the uh
I gotta find the correct episode because
this this really shows off the
technology they had available back in
200 and oh we go here we go I think was
the wireless episode yes there it
is every industry needs project managers
and a Google career certificate can help
you get the skills to get the job you'll
learn project
planning all right let's
go uh what have you brought with you and
let's start out with yeah the first
thing we're going to talk about is the
new BlackBerry this is from 2001 this is
a black communica from Research In
Motion this is the 975 most people are
used to small Blackberry let's look at
this here you got your stock uh stock
tickle here you got a green on black
screen you got a pretty good keyboard a
little email device this is more than
that yeah this is more like a PDA in the
sense that it does have a bigger screen
but what it really does is have better
connectivity to the Internet so as you
see here I just check Microsoft stock
all right so I can do more than just
check email I can go on to sort of PDA
enabled websites yeah and specifically
things like ABC News and Reuters and
sports news stocks usual kind of stuff
Airline schedules Airline schedules
things of that yeah that's great and
it's nice to see that people are still
interested in doing that way back in
2001 right so it's good to see that we
have progressed to this with never apps
you got ABC News Sparks news at CNN has
an app
um what else does Warriers have an app
I'm not sure it's not like I have any of
them on my phone but you got all you got
all your news apps on here app has a
stocks app you can check your stocks you
can even do your own stock stocks on
here with different mobile apps that
nature now it doesn't really replace the
PDA in the S it's not a really those
channels uh local some local channels
not sure those year about CNN you can
get some of those channels on some apps
like LG free TV Samsung free TV uh and
then go to the new section or 2B not a
PDA it's a wireless information it's a
wireless information device and of
course it does email got it and how
reliable is the service can you get it
use it anywhere this is an amazing tool
actually I use this all over the country
and almost anywhere I go I get a good
signal so it's actually a pretty good
tool for that how expensive this one
runs between and $500 to use it like in
the Midwest and dark Central and Great
Plains because of course you know back
in 2001 development would be done on the
west coast because Silicon Valley they
move towards East Coast because most
people do but I mean maybe like Texas
because it's a rich State stuff like
that but like some of the states might
get left behind some more R rural areas
I wonder if he tested them through of
course he might just be traveling over
the Tech Convention so he might be in
New York Los Angeles Houston
Dallas like major cities and maybe not
trying them you know in the interior of
the United States depending on the
carrier you and the service uh service
runs about between 35 and 45 a month
whatever I don't we don't care about
this but I want to get to this so we got
a
palm this is a Kyo here running Palm OS
but here you have a tablet this is
actually interesting this is actually
not on the market running Windows and
this antenna allows access Internet give
you an idea of where we're going with it
this is the national semiconductor did a
project with Metrocom called the
Ricochet Metro webpad this will be on
the market later this summer does that
look interesting uh what is this nine
years before the first iPad you have
basically the same thing ex internet
think the iPad all it could do maybe
some apps on there but basically access
to the internet all from the web a
little short St antenna and run into
full operating system or Windows CA
maybe not full but
decent oh here we go here we go look at
this look at this this is before Samsung
Note right nine years before the
note um years before uh six years before
the iPhone right nine years before the
iPad right and this about they doing on
phones in
2001 keyboard
pal s and pop it in put up my screen boy
I now have a wireless portable Computing
device you got everything and a full
keyboard not mouse keyboard right real
keyboard I right I go to the little word
writing pad on here go to my email
program on here and now for less than
five I me with it what more do some
people need and people attack my R want
to type some documents I want to do this
and do that this why Samsung deck is so
important right that's why I say I we to
get Samsung Dex on every device that can
support a54 and up or a855 whatever
right maybe even 835 like just some
simple video output or even just a a
better layout for typing you got word
Mobile on here you guys got um Excel and
all these apps right you got your typing
your web browsing and you're done just
to have a better web browser with maybe
some extension support open more than a
100 tabs Samsung internet um Chrome can
do that but Samsung internet is the
better browser on Deck it shows all your
tabs it it's feels better probably
because it's been coded for that in
particular for $500 I have a full
Wireless portable keyboard uh PDA
basically everything I need
fundamentally on the road it doesn't
have to be that hard works I mean that's
still great works every time Tim thank
you very much well the future of
Wireless Communications is much more
than just smarter understand which way
we should go no he's showing totin that
it's like a just a demo device but
they're saying that they want to bring
uh videos to cell phones and one of his
examples is that you can watch traffic
Camp so that's watch this is better than
just hearing the traffic report like you
might do on your desktop or on TV see
what the traffic looks like ahead and it
doesn't need to just be traffic I could
check in on my kids as I'm traveling or
from a security standpoint I could I
mean he was right back in 2001 now you
guys got ringed and wise uh cams and you
can check in take a look at my house my
office all right well that's two good
examples how about another one now what
about uh like online interactive gaming
can you do that kind of stuff yeah we do
since you're Wireless
there it is right there and this is a
multiplayer game where you could have
somebody else on a cellular device
that's one of the things I guess I I
don't care but I
miss from a tech standpoint the ability
to game let's say Roblox right you're
playing in a game of Roblox just you own
private server with maybe like one or
two other people that's to be able to
work offline without internet maybe just
with Wi-Fi without having to Ping the
Roblox servers or something right back
back then you could go there's some game
consoles I believe that yeah was in no
the uh Playstation little attachment
thing from 99 you could point it with ar
you could play multiplayer with just
infrared right um you could share files
with infrared they even did that in
Odyssey um which is science fic is um
but now everything is online and I think
we should get back to we should still
use internet for like more powerful
server based Computing test but like if
you want to play multiplayer games with
someone on a road trip and you're
driving through and your connection cuts
out you don't have data youed should be
able to do that maybe it's Point device
or hotspotting so you make your own
Wi-Fi
network right playing a fantasy type
this one is a a Batman and Robin type
all let's move on to another example and
uh again in entertainment I mean you
could sort of watch TV on this right
yeah that's what it basically this is
Comedy Central right here
and uh we've got about a hundred
different partners oh this is terrible
in the in the Hollywood area kids will
never get any work done anymore I that's
funny a TV in your pocket right it works
great with animation like this too also
I believe that this is tapping in to the
television broadcast of Comedy Central I
that channel so I don't think this is
over the Internet so that's even that's
great it's all imp standard all right
how about another example let me get
this back up here for you the other
thing that happens is uh a lot of times
you're on your way to go see a movie but
you're not really sure of what you want
to see the statistics going to see you a
movie trailers basically like YouTube
and they have their own little online
service too but I I got I wanted to get
into this I saw this in a movie but I
knew about it before
um and this this this is the
epitome of uh technology in my opinion
like it is the greatest one of the
greatest spy toys of all time let's go
in your ear there that's right the
Bluetooth people should understand that
the Bluetooth signal is is totally safe
baby little signal that's right and it
looks very cool M yes I it improves my
face enormously now let's turn to our
next Gadget which are these I love this
is the
Coco I look at this it's basically a
smartphone get communication device one
onone it's like a walkie-talkie why
can't we have stuff like this anymore
like yeah I know you can text your
friends let's say I messed Siler down i
i m Sil down you should be able to do
this I I saw this in a movie what's it
called
uh big fat M just this what the story is
on S well I'm going to go ahead and
press and hold the Escape key to turn it
on let look at this thing you got a
screen you got an antenna I mean some
some some of the stuff like this was and
of course this this would be better for
let's say Nation not Nationwide uh
neighborhood wide child
Espionage so let's say that you have
your
um your neighborhood right and you have
like a spy team let's say red team blue
team
whatever right so instead of having to
use
walkie-talkies which apparently
children's walkie-talkies go out all the
time none of mine work so we're gonna
have to reinvest in that all right let's
say you guys get your cyber Co you're
texting with te other but you guys have
a tech geek and someone goes online you
check what the frequencies are so then
they pull out the sdrs boom they CLI it
they click it in they get the correct
software and they intercept all the
messages so they know whenever these
people are planning to invade spy
whatever and but then maybe you guys
change frequencies or text each other
maybe have some signal Jammers it just
be so much fun you guys are texting and
chatting with each other and you guys
all each have Level Playing Field with
each other if you guys did this say now
like it is near impossible to tap into a
cell phone the technological
capabilities are not present on our
computer for
that I know I've tried
um here we go on this is a a device for
teenagers and and older kids it it does
absolutely everything it has a Spanish
English dictionary it's an organizer it
has email so let me where Spanish and
English dictionary organizer and
email that is amazing on a little
wireless network right now but oh I just
heard you just did something mine just
buzz it just buzzed because they
recognized each other they are now
communicating with each other yeah you
can game with each other with no Wi-Fi
no Bluetooth just with each other things
you can do that's fun as games let's go
ahead and play a game I mean this is
basically like the T-Mobile hiptop of
2001 the team hiptop is the D hiptop is
one of the greatest phones of Al time in
my opinion other was that whole little
uploading everything to a server so then
someone got hacked but that's basically
like the iPad iPhone thing but it is
it's amazing Stuart you don't have to do
anything I'm going to go ahead and
you're going to send a message and me
saying steuart you want to play a game
that's exactly right so we're like we're
sitting in class and it's really boring
and we're on opposite sides of the room
that's correct and after I send you the
but that's kind of loud and gangly also
I can
imagine let's say have a book set in
2001 and let's say that it accidentally
the signals got crossed with each other
and you're sending messages about let's
say your crush or something like that
again that's at threat don't send
messages like that on your cyer Cod
whatever so you're typing there and then
your CR also has a cyer Cod your you're
typing to your friend right but your
signals got crossed because you're like
the Cyber codes you really think these
are adhering to the best data encryption
standards in 2001 no so then all the
messages come through to the wrong cyber
Co that'd be funny the answers to the
test um we can go ahead and play this
game now what's happening is it's asking
you go ahead and say yeah just hit enter
there okay so I'll hit enter say yes I'm
willing to play the game and we'll go
ahead and start the game what game we
going to play here this is darts so
you're invited me to play of darts
that's right and for parents this is
much safer than real darts okay so um
it's go ahead and it's your move steuart
oh okay so I got to see if I can
actually see just hit enter and um okay
I see so I have to like time that little
thing there and hit and because we're
Wireless I see where your Dart hit and
the interesting thing about this in
terms of games is that they put up a one
game a day free of charge you can
download download got an internet
connection here wow one game a day which
is a lot better than that handheld
console with like the wind up thingy
isn't it like two games a month or
something like that for 24 one game a
day you're making 30 Games a month you
hook this up to the PC and download
games now there's an interesting
Wireless element to that you can take
one of these and hook it up to your PC
and run a special application which
makes this the server now the other cyos
are up to a 100 other cyos within 300
feet range now have an internet
connection live that's 99 bucks that' be
great though first and can you imagine
running a student election campaign in
2001 with the Cyber Co so you plug your
cyber Co into your laptop and you plug
the laptop into the modem right you jack
it into e that whatever right and you're
like all right kids take up your cyber
codes you got 100
people which gotta be the slowest
internet of all time like run basically
dial up or maybe if you're likey band
like Broadband speech and you got a 100
cyber codes on it whatever so you got
your cyber codes you take up your cyber
codes click in this link ww
that Ethan safe GCA that boom type it in
and then and then you guys see the Alex
campaign Alex video something like that
amazing are you be like all right guys
let's play a game and
all oh imagine the potential for growth
and opportunity that the kids had with
the amount of technology that was
available at their fingertips for only
$99 which um 99 USD
$99 in 2001 would be $175 so about $200
which is a lot of money but I mean that
is birthday present maybe uh you work
the entire summer $5 of a grass cutting
you got you got got in time for school
when this is accessible for kids maybe
$400 or $600 if you have siblings of
course would be a lot of money but I
mean this accessible for one kid and
seems like it' be a neat Gadget to have
and I think we should bring them back uh
at least cheaper $30 now in the forms of
walkie-talkies like the ice spy walkie
talkies basically great example this
they featured for video communication
you can go see that in our spy episode
they need to bring those back I Le have
an application that does that those uh
voice and video applications in
um uh offline space in a confined area
with um smart stereo devices um that
that would be a dream of mine I know
they have something like that from
Bluetooth but I guess it would be better
if they brought it back um no bucks is
it $99 Sao great for kids Mike thank you
very much thank you all
right right that's our look at the
latest and wireless technology don't go
away I'll be back and go that's amazing
all right now let's go to the greatest
website in planet Earth second greatest
all right let's go to Tech boy.org so
our articles for today we reviewed the
new day 10,000 Milli S2 F case talk
about that let's talk about how to
change the sky in a video so as you can
see here we have this regular video here
and if you want to change the sky you
can click these different icons in
motion Ninja on your application in
Android I also think it lets you do it
in
iOS what else do we want to talk about
anything here let's go check TV
[Music]
let's see what we got
here nope nothing outside I think that's
all for now um oh oh sorry I almost
forgot SS ltw sorry which uh I'm running
through some AI programs right now
to uh see it so let's look at our images
here oh look at this we got pus pogus
Allison here and we got me with the
little Poli hute and we got the the rest
of my crack investigative team here and
this is amazing we we got all right so
let's go through everything that we've
that we've been through here all right
and um let's go through everything that
we got on this website so you guys
really checked this out it's really fun
based on reality everything here was
basically stuff that happened through
names and stuff have been changed we
walk to November 9 2022 great story here
uh basically me battling a bunch of
random kids asking a whole bunch of
random questions that have nothing to do
with a student council election all
right and then we here we go in into
like the Back stories and then this is
basically a real investigation TCH real
investigation that we completed in life
world power details me part one running
for president all right and then part
two this image is actually edited with
Galaxy AI speaking of Galaxy AI actually
found out that in your keyboard you can
make it all
offline AI offline it will still suggest
an edit textb so just like apple so is
great all you got World War V which puts
up uh Valery just like a rival Valery
just like in Odyssey versus Hazel uh
Hazel is uh Hazel's in yellow and
Valerie is in blue see how it's 90% And
10% and here we are managing the
competition de and we got on land this
details our battles on land uph the
constitution of SSA and on NC sport to
you can see how we drew just here we got
kids here ranking the most powerful kids
on school all right and investigating a
special agent Maverick all right and
then we got on Cyber which details a
world war or not World War it's more
like a a thing that happened between me
and an NTB user back in September and we
corrupted that into a spy story and I I
think it's doing really well so of
course we won you know SSA ltw it's not
called SSA lose the way it's called SSA
lead the way all and then I set my eyes
toward Glory the name of the fictional
uh Christian School in there so you guys
can go read that
um you guys can go read that on there
and then internal press conference
democracy South stand uh basically
details the in in inner workings of how
uh the glory News network is founded and
how the agency um stood up against
terrorism in the school in mid October
so we got uh we got um Geneva and
Clarissa here and then that's not me
that's the kid in the video what's his
name denu denu is the kid in this video
so yeah there we go SSA ltw check out
the check out the videos really fun um
anybody may be wondering why we have so
little
characters uh so little characters in in
the thing but the truth of the matter is
it's 50 kids so I mean we we already
dealt with like seven of them so that's
more than 10% of the kids that we going
to be dealing with
to and I guess we can get more into um
high school geopolitical strategy in our
next episode on like how to win
elections and
uh things of that nature I will say that
there is this Reddit user who
appreciated my talent hereo so had I
gone back to Energizer uh which is the
public school in SS ltw Series right
where I had that stupid debate for the
kids had I gone back there instead of
Glory uh the
kids
um uh where was I oh yeah had it gone
back there inste Glory we would have Wun
the election
right a little
differently
um I was gonna say
something but well the numbers would
have been different we would have run oh
yeah yeah so the the kids uh a kid on
Reddit was reaching out asking for like
high school strategy on how to H on how
to
um combat theft in his school right and
I also wanted to combat the that hidden
fight gangs in school at my school right
so I told him and this is on Reddit for
all to see what I used to do is he used
to run on let's make the school safe
let's make the school great uh okay
maybe don't heuse that some kid got
kicked out for that uh in TV story
uh let's make the school safe let's make
the school secure
let's let let's make the school
fun yeah like basic high school
political to get elected stuff right but
secretly go back in and you use your
database and maybe use some teachers
help and be like all right these are
some of the most trustworthy kids in the
school and get them to work around you
you appoint them to be like your hall
monitor
right and they will report to you maybe
daily or weekly on what's going on and
stuff and also maybe leave some stuff
out intentionally have them like pretend
not to pay attention like get the mosten
cameras
and and
um get some to the cameras and then
catch the thieves in action and report
them to to the people but of course
these students can't reveal themselves
basically like undercover uh
cops uh Undercover
undercover undercover cops who basically
monitor the school report to the council
and Council reports to the uh
authorities right of course because
everyone knows running on let's make the
school safe and I'm gonna send you all
to throw you all in detention and uh you
all will now be surveilled by an elite
group of kids if you don't know is going
to get you one vote and one vote only
just like how we said like running on
Christianity and Christianity alone
isn't a good uh strategy for for the
school however there is one
one uh exception to this here it is is
from this television show called young
shell
uh
1989 and actually this person is the
exception to the world of running on
Christianity and Christianity alone
as an election campaign is a terrible
idea except for this imagine this 1989
Texas candidates your Treasurer
candidates your Vice
presid and Sheldon Cooper one of these
look how tall she is compared to him two
will be president of your class
remember try for a
week he just looks presidential like
look at her hair and look at her face
she's like I have prepared all I don't
know I don't know 16 years for
this
this thank you Miss mroy principal
Peterson are hardworking teachers and my
fellow y y y I'm blessed to call so many
of you friends y'all probably know
everything about me already Lord knows I
love to talk
whatever here at Medford High and well
that sounds
wonderful the truth is he thinks our
school wastes its money on
[Music]
football 1989 like the middle of Texas
they don't even have a real team yeah uh
you're not getting votes for that
kid do we really want a class president
who doesn't care about
football it's crazy I know I'm proud to
be a Medford High cheer and I love
football but you know the one thing I
love more than
football
God that's crazy like I mean it is a
legitimate strategy and you can't even
see it BR it is a legitimate strategy
the one and only time this is actual
strategy is if you're ring in like 19 89
Texas in a small town I'm not talking
about like in Houston well R try that uh
no that's not working let me tell you
another interesting fact about my
opponent did you know that Sheldon
Cooper is an atheist what that's right
he doesn't believe in God this is the
only time this an effective strategy so
yeah all right um that's all we have for
now</pre>
