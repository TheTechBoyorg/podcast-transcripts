<h1>TheTechBoy Podcast + The Launch of TheTechBoy Media and Tech War Updates</h1>
<pre>hello everybody good morning good
afternoon and good evening and welcome
to the this week in the tech boy podcast
all right so the tech boy has been doing
some very important stuff this week so
let's get down to it so first of all I
have a very special announcement for you
guys the tech boys interview with Keith
for kids radio we'll go live on Monday
and I will update you there all right
all right so now I hope you guys can see
this text and here it says the tech boy
property of the tech boy media because
this means I merged all my Subs together
created the brand new website and now
the tech boy media is its own media
company so um sites like
um PC Mac and the village have
um other websites that go along with
them and I decided to create my own
media company to compete with them and
to create a more Christian
um family-friendly alternative to their
website so we actually put them in the
middle of a tech wall and I hope you can
let's play the video here
all right
um You probably won't be able to hear
the sound let me see if I can I meet you
I don't know desktop audio
all right it is a YouTube short about 45
seconds and here we go
I'm declaring war on most of tech media
tired of these anti-biblical and dumb
political ideas they're being pushed on
our Tech websites today when I go to a
tech website I want to see Tech content
not the dumb political content that they
have to put up there because their
Publishers tell them to so too bad
there's no alternative is it's called
the tech boy.org and you won't have to
see these dumb political
um posts and everything that just that
Apple needs some new product and they
went on political on it of course they
did it's annoying so um just visit the
tech boy.org and you'll get actual tech
reviews When I visit Tech websites I
want to see tech reviews and Tech
opinions not dumb political and
anti-biblical ideas and declining War
all right so there is the video right
there and we declared war on them and on
Twitter we declared war on Android
authority PC mag and the foods so
there's that so if you guys want to join
me in this world
um please share that video on social
media everywhere else all right next
um I showed everyone how to stabilize
video on Android using Google photos
it's really simple all you have to do is
push a rectangle button in the edit
section of um Google photos so
this is what it looks like and here is a
video showing stabilized which is
unstabilized footage
all right so that's it I showed off how
to stabilize footage on Google photos I
hope you guys enjoyed that post I also
showed out what unsplash is and how to
use it and honestly I suggest a um photo
sharing website not photo sharing
website but a website that allows you to
get photos
um stock photos for free for example
this image here um the Samsung Galaxy
s22 Ultra is an unsplash photo and this
is an underpassed photo so I looked up
Windows 11 computer Samsung phone you
can find nice images for websites
commercial free
um sorry um content attribution free
license free you can attribute the
photographers photographers if you want
because you don't have to I also showed
why phones should come with 120 frames
per second video recording because it
gives you a really smooth video but also
it gives you the ability to
um slow it down say 1 8 150 for Speed
and Luma fusion and get really crisp
really clean video in slow motion so so
that's really nice and interesting so my
s22 plus chemical 1080p 120 FPS and
that's nice but 4K just gives it the
more crisp feeling sorry food um
function that can record it should be
the OnePlus 10 Pro the upcoming OnePlus
11 Pro uh Sony's Xperia one mark IV and
a ZTE phone so I go in depth too so
um speaking of the checkboy media
um I had added an inches of Genesis
right here and let's go see I will have
to
um
sweet so we have the Odyssey boy which
is a uh there we go websites for some
reason there's not linked to that allows
you to
um I'm talking about
um audio dramas here so is that an audio
drop is just uh
uh basically an audio play for your ears
and then CC
you can see this all right so this is
going to be more um stuff here and then
I just link the tech boy here and why is
it doing that
anyway I need to fix that
um and you can see underneath it says
the division attack with media and this
is our media page
media.thetechboy.org let me show you
guys what it looks like
so you can see the flagship Tech site
um CC the adventures in Odyssey fan site
and I've hosted the day widget
underneath here and then our email here
and then I describe what the tech web
media represents and I hope that my
listeners viewers and um videos can all
agree on this the techboard.org was
found performed in December of 2020
we're announcing the official launch of
detectable media
um we're going to fully focus on reviews
uh most of the time but you will now get
to enjoy audio travel content from The
Odyssey boy Christian jokes and Santa
from CC and fun gaming and stop-motion
content from Maestro Moon which is a
YouTube channel check it out I'll show
it on here the Techno media is the best
and safest Christian medium
Entertainment Group accessible for the
entire family so I hope you enjoy the
techboard media and what our goal is and
how we're going to accomplish it and let
me just show you some of the Maestro
