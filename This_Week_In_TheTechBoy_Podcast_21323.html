<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 21323</h1>
<pre>podcast
[Music]
hello and welcome to the This Week in
Tech podcast I'm the tech boy and today
we have plenty to talk about today from
the cow can sweat Pro 3 earbuds the uh
Samsung Galaxy s22 plus camera samples
and Camera sample review it'll be coming
up soon to what we talked about in Tech
this week's purpose let's get into the
Vlog all right so in the blog
um
okay
um
f-check GPT questions we talked about
plus 11.
um and we also talked about baby bio
YouTube having SM so let's get into it
starting with the daily right right s
and if you may know the daily wire is a
large Media Company on YouTube and they
also have their own media on
their own website
two videos
um so yeah so they have to own YouTube
channels and across those YouTube
channels
um there's plenty of
spam comments in the premios YouTube
premiers and in the tracks and that's a
problem because they don't really
moderate stuff because you know
thanks so much what are the problems and
say what does it have to do with tech
and you know YouTube it's a major
problem because they have a large user
base and this is the problem to the
viewer to viewers out there watching any
YouTube channel people the creators
aren't going to telegram you if they
have the word telegram in their
description it's not real and if it's a
big YouTuber that saved the baby wire
adjusting into PhD they'll usually have
a check mark next to their names if she
knows so be safe out there if you see
something that says WhatsApp
and then they have these rare numbers
next to it that's not real that's not
them anyone can make a YouTube channel
and copy and paste
absolutely I could tend to be the daily
wire screenshot and disappeared
into YouTube block messages started
being spammed over and over again in the
UTP news and Mexican people can't
impersonate show hosts but I don't know
making sure that their usernames can be
too similar I'm making so you can
include words like WhatsApp Telegram and
then the phone number in your YouTube
name because people are getting scammed
and that's not good even one percent of
the people eat scams there's still
thousands of people to channels that
have millions
all right now on to the other thing I
need to add an image here I extract GPC
some questions so let's get into it
first like I said to write a poem about
George Bush president because there's
this thing about how we can't write
poems about some presidents and how
okay so I just asked to see and it did
so interesting I kept everything in
format just me and then it wrote this
poem here
that's what it's not the V it kind of is
wrong because not the B is an actual
website as you can see in my review uh
on that website so go just so it's not
the video you see that and then I asked
about this favorite YouTube channel is
and it says as a language I can't see
any of that
and that was the three questions
all right now getting to the major phone
nonsense speak to OnePlus 11. and I want
to give some thought to that and then
we're going to transition to the
counting earbudge segment so uh OnePlus
11 launched and
I know some people comparing it to the
10 Pro and saying the tempo the 11th
Acoustics between the tempo but I really
feel like the 11 is uh updated 10t okay
so all right d11 I watched the
presentation on YouTube
um it
it really was about speed they talked a
lot about the cameras and
um I will mention reviews about it and
it is a upper mid-range Flagship camera
okay so it's not going to compete with
s23 but it's better to say
I don't know pixel 6A a53 all right so
it's like a
I don't know maybe s20
one Fe camera style like it's kind of
like an Fe phone
but it's super powerful it's a great
snap termination too a large 5000
battery it's 6.7 inch screen
um so it really is a flagship it has
fledges you need to get matte black or
faucet glass or something
um
simple camera but only a two type of two
times instead of the zoom camera is not
the best cameras you have to miss out on
something features such as wireless
charging but in exchange you do get 80
watt charging with the charger in the
box so none of that oh wait we just
trying to save the finally
so we're not going to include spiders
the monkeys
of some country you know
monkeys
into zoos
all over the place
just every bit charges in the boxes
it would really fight the monkeys
and the elephants
and attacks
all the poor animals
only we have
no charger in the Box whatever charges
should be in the Box
and unfortunately the phone doesn't have
uh headphone jack anything but one thing
uh but they did release that was
interesting versus one plus pad which I
was thinking one first time would be a
budget Pad but no 12 gigs if I am 140
foot display it's a super square or
something like that so yeah it looks
good to me and speaking of ram this has
16 gigabytes of RAM 250 gigabytes of
storage all for 799 which is basically
the base price of the s22 to s23 because
I said will be the best smartphone of
the Year bro I mean this might be the
best fake phone of the year but on the
s20 ultra I mean if you don't want to
pass 20 volts this is probably better
than this plus unless you need Dex
because this isn't a video about support
unless you want a better camera and
wireless charging and yeah so I would
say that it's more well-rounded flag
except it's a faster Flagship and misses
out on some core features which makes it
a better 10t the 10t was a super fast
except they didn't have as good as the
camera but you know stupid camera
so that's why I say this is it but the
temple was like one plus blacks nine Pro
and I found the best phones
I don't know maybe one person can make a
super pro 8.99 effective from next year
but anyway just a great film it's gonna
compete well with iPhone's 14 plus it's
going to One Magnum and the uh s23 plus
I think it's a good competition for the
Samsung's s23 plus yeah I think this is
a speed super fast from 250 gigabytes
special Ram I heard there's still some
Shadow mag but maybe it can come in
some traffic updates it's speaking of
software update full use of software
updates and five years of security
patches tying Samsung beating Google so
great job to workplace getting software
and I don't know about the time and some
people don't like the new oxygen OS but
it is good and since with this new Ram
it's gonna be super fluid super fast but
if it's more fluid than the OnePlus 7
Pro I mean it's it's gonna be effective
ly
and this is just me live eleven lights
and alongside the OnePlus 11 months
great so speaking of earbuds but for me
I did a great train just to go through
it anyway speaking of earbuds now let's
talk about the cow can sweat flow three
all right cow can sweat for three coming
up I have spent some time with these I
went back I literally liked my life
without going from them right now but
this is the calculate poetry
um they're called scrapbook dude I think
because they have uh uh they're they're
good for exercising
um they're sweat resistance water
resistant apparently they can walk in
the shower I haven't tested that yet my
phone will use a nap yet but I mean I
like this for YouTube there is a tiny
bit of lag you can notice but I don't
game and there is a gaming mode
which you can activate by pushing this a
couple of times it's testing some
controls the charging case uh it's okay
I mean the hinge isn't that sturdy it's
magnetic here this has a little icon
here to sort of charging
um left in the cable and it charges over
USBC you say oh that's great there's an
even a nice little flap here to keep
dust and water I guess out but the
problem is um if you can see
there's like a uh
it's recessed in there using plastic so
let's say I want to use uh my regular
phone charger
um that came with my Samsung Galaxy
a715g so this is this basic Samsung
charger here
um 25 watt plugged into my computer if I
wanted to plug it in here
it doesn't go in oops I mean I just want
to use micro USB or whatever like I
still need to use the cable here to fix
it in the box which is nice for a USBC
cable USB a USBC and it perfectly fits
it so that's nice but I mean I guess it
would do that I don't know if a reverse
Wireless charges let me check I don't
think it does I don't even know how it
push these cross because I got them sent
to me but
book of a guaranteed tech review so
we'll check that out
um I'll test I'll show you guys the mic
test the mic's not good uh it's all but
you can be to judge that and as I unlock
my phone so they can test to see if it
uses Wireless if you can charge
wirelessly
um I'm going to talk about the battery
life and I think the battery life is
pretty good
um all right
foreign
yeah I didn't think so anyway I think
the battery life is pretty good
um the charging battery life I don't
know maybe two days in the case so I'm
not really that big of a music Missler
but I heard the little over this week in
the tech uh intro music and it didn't
sound that good but you know you have
left that's all good
um you have touch controls to pause and
play music
um I think you can summon a virtual
assistant if you press and hold I
haven't spent that much time with it but
this is just a personal presence so I'm
going to switch over to the mic now from
mic 2.
this is what it would sound like right
now right okay hear me talking
um
of course on Samsung's pro video mode
you can um
uh use this as a mic if you wanted to
but back to the main mic
all right we're back on the main mic so
tell me guys and tell me what you think
about the sound in the comments about
what you think about the audio quality
um so yes that is the cow can sweat buds
Pro 2. hopefully I have a few full
review out don't run it
but I do say that these sound really
good
really really good
and uh I think I want to do one more
segment just
no two more seconds I'm gonna do two
more seconds I'm gonna talk about this
camera next and I'm coming next we're
going to talk about uh my gimbal which I
used all right so cue the intro music
all right let's talk about this camera's
camera is great it's a little Wi-Fi
camera I got from uh Galaxy tech review
it
if it stay connected to my phone more it
would be great it's a power button it
has an SD card which is nice
um
but it just needs to stay connected to
my phone I think this is the
are you away or something like that but
yeah please just give that to stay
connected
Services that's it all right now for the
final segment let's talk about my Gimbal
and then you survive
all right so yesterday I was doing some
filming with my phone for a project a
school project and this gimbal came in
handy it connected via Bluetooth stay
connected you kept the phone's favorite
when I was running around doing pushes
and floors and leaves and whatever
um
I didn't use any of the tracking
features I just kept it a little bit
steady the phone was great phone Samsung
Galaxy s22 plus camera quality uh in the
daylight which is a perfect overcast day
country bright colors I can show you
some of this stuff
um in my upcoming photo of you that will
come up soon hopefully it comes out this
month
um I need to really start putting it
together anyway great gimbal I recommend
getting it I got it fifty dollars
um if you want to invest in a better
gambling It Go with the whole game
gimbal get the one that has a camera up
here so you can track your face even
when you're not in the air I would
recommend getting that maybe 99 dollars
oh I got that on sale on eBay for $50 so
yeah great gimbal um
if you're having a problem with
stabilizing it there's an article on our
website about how to fix that the phone
needs to be like really centered here so
it's for my phone in the case it was on
the button which is kind of activated
Bixby whatever
um but yeah great gimbal I say you
should invest in one if you want to do
mobile photography videography and also
I say I need to invest in a good
um
overhead camera tripods I Can Do Better
unboxing videos so if any of you have
any tips for that please tell me all
right that's all for now Tech talk to
you later
