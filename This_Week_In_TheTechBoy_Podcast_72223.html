marshmallows crunchy crunchy yum yum
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
apparently people on Tick Tock have done
exactly what I've been doing and making
seven thousand dollars a day by
pretending to be in PC which I recently
learned stands for non-playable
character it was awesome
Odyssey episode from
much it's in the Club episode where they
divided with NPC mid and I knew what it
meant already did Yay good for me my
agency terms are already coming up and
it appears that we have a a new person
in here hello Robert and welcome to the
podcast episode now
um back to that new tick tock trend for
people dress for teach over and over and
over the thing again uh pretending to be
NPCs where they make money
um doing it somehow by people sending
them emoticons in the uh chat
the here's my take on it and it's gonna
be short because remember I went famous
for hating Tick Tock and it's still
there but look they make money on Tick
Tock by pretending to be stupid that
illnesses aren't the people who watched
him and it like they make money on that
good for them that's all I'm gonna say
that's my take on that because I have
more interesting things to talk about
than crunchy marshmallows now
we have plenty of tech stories for you
guys today but
um this week's recent episode no not
collab episode this week's recent
Adventure Odyssey episode
um launching on Thursday night club
listeners sorry spoilers ahead
um
there's a new social that not new Social
Network these people are live streaming
from this application called face space
from a portable cellular device
uh let me fold up the AIO Wiki article
hopefully you guys can see it let me
check oh oh I forgot to announce not
tomorrow next week on Saturday we don't
have a time set but on Saturday I will
be doing a live stream I want to get a
hundred people in this chat
simultaneously to celebrate the
three-year anniversary of the tech boy
media I have a special compilation video
for you for you I have a special intro
I'm going to thank all of you guys
especially
um all the people who've helped me along
the way
eight years I might want to do a
giveaway if we can get some money in
fast enough uh e-money
um
uh maybe I'll buy something so we can
ship it out probably us only because
you know international shipping is
expensive and don't forget we are still
selling the CCO uh phone thank you thank
you congratulations Robert uh if you
want to upgrade from that Galaxy a uh
Galaxy a a 11 13 whatever phone you have
uh I am selling a TCL 40xl
um here I don't know if the bands are
broken but I'm starting a TCL 30 40 x
channel here pretty good price 230
dollars
um so I'm going to drop the links in the
chat so that you can see
um and then we're going to get straight
to the
uh
what's it called
uh Aim so as I find the link let's look
into the space space according to the
AIO Wiki this is the most comprehensive
Adventist wiki of all time quote base
spaces or social networking site is is
its name is a spoof of face book now I
know you can live stream on Facebook it
seems like face space is the be all
end-all
phone for uh application for everything
it's like one one chat application
indivisible with liberty and justice for
um
anyway
it seems that the
the it it is the de facto go to social
network of all time in the adventures
Madison uni first
and if you want to access the adventures
in Odyssey universe
um you can do it from your brand ish new
TCL
40 XL right here Link in the chat
if you wanted to support the tech Floyd
media you can pay for a phone and we
will ship it to you capitalism in action
all right now to our first actual Tech
story of the day I'm going this is from
the Washington examiner let me score
guys all these ads it's about electric
cars I saw this coming in this
electrifying
um uh story from the Washington examiner
hopefully you guys can see this on the
screen there you go quote electrical
struggle to hold up a bit Heat Wave
roasting to United States that's
interesting
um
so it seems that cold Vehicles we
already know it does affect the
batteries of electric cars basically
batteries lifting batteries which is
basically putting yourself from a
grander scale in electric cars I think
they want to be around 32 to like 100
shots of degrees so if you're here at
Houston Texas
um you're good electric all year round
like maybe a few days in December in
January they call this usual month of
January you might not want to go outside
I don't know like it's not going to get
something negative temperatures or even
single digit temperatures
but I feel like an in like Ohio
uh
like Alaska's you probably don't want an
electric car or if you've probably even
here Houston in the summer months you
don't want that especially during these
Heats at advisories you see it's
document that cold after and one of the
effects EVS once you're above 140
degrees Fahrenheit which I think one
city has hit 10 days in a row
I think so that's an interesting thing
coming out of electric vehicles and then
also we have another story talking about
Google's AI but before we get to this
Google's AI story uh this is a story
that I actually kind of accidentally
broke on the podcast last week
um
Lucid motor seemed kind of cool I'll
look into them
um last week on the podcast I was
searching for a specific not the big
article to show you these little tiny
Legos and I was doing site colon
nottheby.com but then um portrait Lego
and usually in the days gone by I
supposed to find any word relating to
Lego on that one site that could be a
cop but it didn't work because Google
has
told us that they have pulled support
for advanced search mechanism where you
can search one site because people
didn't move it use it as much to replace
it with AI and I think that it's
absolutely terrible look I like that
yeah AI I'm a fan of it you know I say
um there's a quote of me saying on this
live stream and I will screen record and
post it
learn to channel it's not my last name
but someone else's I called in and I
said quote that AI is like guns can be
used as a tool for good or evil or
something along those uh lines
I'll see if I can pull it up uh here uh
later but if Google is replacing its
advanced search mechanisms and even it's
already the place it's pagnation
mechanism which is the first page second
page State page in
in that instrument of scrolling at least
here in the U.S Robert in the UK is it
still first page second page to the page
are you still school and especially on
mobile it's like you scroll for one page
and you get all these it's kind of like
a square have you ever seen like an
iPhone an iPhone uh
home screen widget thingy and you just
see the widgets and app clicks and it
kind of looks like that's more like a
news feed of some sorts but yeah the
replacement of replacing uh advantages
of AI I think probably other search
engines can do this but
it's not good but Google's AI is I guess
they're integrating it into some
Newsroom services so they're gonna sell
it to people so they can report on the
news
but here's a funny compilation I don't
know I just looked at it funny
compilation of some
ai's mishaps missed steps right
technology hasn't been perfected yet
hopefully you can see it here on the
screen
from the Washington examiner again
Gizmodo but remember we
um let's see
if you see this Moto said it's useless
men's Channel
and AI
generated article yes all these websites
Tina and Instagram I had AI mishaps that
I've seen that I think most
uh it's really bad for them
um
yeah so be careful and those those
newsrooms better be careful because they
don't want to be reporting like
stories
okay all right um on to our next story
from not to be oh yes yes oh I forgot
about this oh man I forgot to enter into
this but I can do this right now
USA USA USA shoes could be Hood from the
CNBC
uh stream as public SQ went public
on the NYSC New York Stock Exchange this
week
um public SQ is this application I'm on
it it allows you to find uh businesses
that align with traditional American
values and now they're finally public
um let me find which means I could by
stocking them so let me find their
oh my God
wait that's a story I missed it let me
find the
uh article from ntp I want to see
someone commented here oh and we also
have to talk about threats but before we
do this uh let's see how you wanna say
USA is doing uh
on the stock market because hopefully
their stock market prices are better
than their app development yes I said it
their app development is kind of bad in
their website
site Works trash
um but if you want I want to take one
yourself
because I believe in the product they
just need to
like fix it
I'm searching their stock price on line
using the Google search engine
it would be really funny if I use like
duck that go a brave browser to
subscribe like SQ but now I'm not gonna
do that
um It's A psq Holdings
is this Public Square
20 topics
oh just can't pick it because
they they've been open foreign
let's see what their price is
I want to see the stock price
I don't care what they said in the
blah blah blah blah blah
I want to see the stock price
I think the stock market's closed today
because it's Saturday right oh dang they
created oh wow twenty one dollars twenty
dollars so they're trading around 21 a
share that's actually larger than they
expected 21 share is not that bad like
decent investment of course it looks
like they created but that's just the
initial hype uh
29 so I guess now's the time to buy this
is not a financial advice for regular
Choice reasons of course but
in the crash wait was that today I
didn't know the stock market was open
today anyway
this is the overvite and it makes sense
all right so about
twenty dollars a share of stock price
um that's
that's interesting
um let's get to our next article uh
we'll find a public execute USA article
um soon but this is new application
coming in to I guess Shannon's public
excuse to kind of do the same thing uh
it's called vet beeps Thebes
v-e-e-b-s where is my phone okay well
it's not here right now
um even though I brought it in my pocket
did it walk away
um anyway veebs it's a application it's
in the Play Store uh even though it says
it's an app store come on uh it says
Brands online if you post the value
settings for suggestions for once or not
so it it's not exactly like skill I
guess it's just you know healthy
Fair competition
um let's see if I can bring up the
application on the screen
um veebs hey where'd everyone go come
back guys come back come into the screen
oh looks like someone commented oh no
it's uh
okay dibs
well I'll tell you which brand is good
value
all right and basically
it has like it ranks it it then tells
you what to get instead interesting
maybe I'll do a review maybe it'll
sponsor me we'll see and speaking about
sponsorships we got our first one and we
got paid thanks to intella the fluence
thank you thank you thank you here we
are on the best tech site in the world
on July 19th we got paid compensated
failing for players.org review you can
go and check that out
here all right and we also have another
one coming out soon I might publish it
today
um in fact
they didn't ask me to do this but I'm
going to be nice I'm going to show off
what place it work looks like here it is
but it's not org we're gonna pick up
random kid I don't game at all so
um don't be surprised when just looks
really bad
yeah I gone straight yeah pretty telling
for today's
goodness I don't have to sign it
um okay so as you're waiting for this
application to load
okay
I just want to play a game oh
tamachi yin yang puzzle never would have
hit all right here we go
and this site does not require a flash
to play this site is just browser based
and they also have some games that are
suited more for white screen experiences
like this one and vertical screen
experiences which would be better suited
to be played on a mobile device like one
player
is that the game
okay
I have to get the other one you have to
click here or something
I'm trapped
well this is what happens when you make
me play a video game I'm pretty sure the
games better designed than that I just
don't know how to play all right
um
well it's time to Shell for my dreams
not change uh
what's that thing about buy me a coffee
I got my first buy me a coffee last week
let's see if I can get one this week
about a year ago
all right buy me a coffee and we'll
Circle back around to NTB again but now
it's time for that YouTube reaction
segment of the show it's a new circuit
that we just made up two seconds ago but
that we've always had
all right oh we have three YouTube
notification trophy we can't see this
let me respond to this
let's see some people
may take it as a
challenge all right great just
responding to comment here
um
we're gonna we're gonna go over to not
nothing but Tech not to be confused with
NTB
she has reviewed the iPhone no not
iPhone the nothing phone
did nothing fun okay so we're going to
share this tab oh it is shared listen to
like let you see it there you go and
we're going to be looking at her
Real World review the day in the life of
the nothing found two six minutes 27
seconds wow Jackson
a t and Verizon rope you in with phone
offers then bind you to a three-year
device contract Break Free T-Mobile
addition to nothing phone too it was
just released today and in today's real
day in life review we're going to be
putting the camera the display and the
battery life real Dan Life review we're
gonna be
so obviously this must have been
recorded in what June we have to June
right
putting the camera the display and the
battery life to the test will be
tracking the battery throughout the day
oh yeah it's a really good ship uh the
epitome the phone tips
definitely it's
weird so I'm going to
be on the phone is actually audio
quality on the phone because we're all
much more likely to deal with that video
we're not likely to deal with bad audio
and I think a lot of Cheaper Android
phones really skimped out on the
microphone quality especially when
you're in a noisy environment and right
now this sounds okay but tinny what do
you think does she sound kind of tinny
to you
so we're in an incredibly noisy
environment at lunch hour in a park and
it is packed there is also one really
weird and interesting Hardware feature
that brings up this bigger question of
who is this phone actually for and
that's kind of going to be the thread
line for this real Day in the Life
review yeah okay so let's just separate
the lights from defense
what we have here is a
kind of overpowered mid-range device
right you have mid-range spec cameras
it
basically a decent screen like
it's a good screen
a weird
launcher but whatever it's Android
but uh high power which just kind of
like
pixel stuff you it it's a pixel 7 the
fights on the back of it
is 12 10 p.m the phone is at 59 thank
you
my phone kind of does that too much it's
getting really hot outside all right
we're into this hot outside but like
I definitely really focused on making
this phone not distract you so like in
the breathing they said
which is kind of funny
oh yeah we made a phone that's not
supposed to distract you so we put 900
LEDs on the back of it
so that you can see your status of your
uru
and I guess set notifications if your
phone it's great but
the phone's like 600 how are they gonna
get engagement
like people
I
they need clicks like
many many times we want this phone to
not be something that you're on all the
time we wanna
looks great but
like
I just need to take that thing off their
phone and they'll have the no phone
which is a really good deterior to using
a phone I mean they they sell they sell
a plastic bag to people they're going to
come out so
I want to be intentional with phone
usage the intense
intentional
disability easy way to do that make a
really bad Android phone and make it
nice and slow you'll be intentional
about when you open it or throw it
across the wall it's a little smartphone
usage Point shows up and actually one of
their design features which is the back
LED light so we saw this in
also there
black and white aesthetic
which
is basically sleep mode on my phone
it's
nothing okay take away the nothing
launcher which someone can use I'm
pretty sure there's a launch in the Play
Store can we both take that away take
away the lights on the back of the folks
strip that
what do we have here we have
okay cameras
okay audio
and a good display
we have the most basic Android phone of
all time
it seems that these lights are looking
for a solution we're like oh okay
whatever great
um
so they said okay look
let's do some market research and be
like what is Jin Z in Millennials into
these days oh they're into not using
their phone as much or something
so to sell to the phone that looks
unique but I guess Gingy wants to be or
something I'm not sure do they want to
conform or do they want to be unique I
don't know I'm that next book
um we're gonna put
lots of LEDs on it because nothing has a
brand needs to stand out because
it just looks like some random basic
Android phone from China or something
right
okay so around 570 something we're gonna
say oh guys look it's for digital
detoxes
and
then
we're going to have this the software
it's gonna be like kind of a black and
white
to I don't know save battery or
something
and
you know people really like dark mode so
you know dark mode I mean this is
basically a dark mode right here and you
know cameras whatever
and they're saying this is a flagship
device
but on Twitter like last year the guy
called pay
you said that the last year's method for
which retail for like 3.99 was a
flagship device and the people stopped
comparing it against the success
so I'm going to compare this as a
flagship
to a reflection do you have
with pixel 7 in ds22 I'd probably get
this over an asteroids but this has no
I don't even know if there's like video
out no optical zoom
I think it has wireless charging it's
just okay Flagship back cameras well
like middle link cameras
a good fluid software
but a pixels I just it's better
initially on nothing phone one but we're
seeing it again here at an enhanced
version actually a setting on the phone
we're on the entire back it's called the
torque
hey basically going to a coffee shop
where's your coffee shop and then when
you do that the entire back lights up
and then there are also features with
the I mean that's great but I don't know
how bright that would be
back of the phone lighting up for
example to kind of get the progress of
like when an Uber is coming or you can
assign certain apps or people
notification privileges where the back
of the phone
that is smart it's like the notification
on Android but 900 times bigger when
they mess to juice you can again be more
intentional with your phone
yeah but it's just screened out black
in the chat who puts this screen push
their phone screen down for that I want
to know
put it face down we're not distracted by
it but you know oh I've got an important
notification the phone gets warmer than
I would expect it to we've worked it
does I was expecting it to be better
with that new chip but okay she's
outside in like a lot of heat like the
temperature today is what's today
so it's like
that's it
kid
that is
84 degrees
that's nice I guess where do you live I
think she's in New York 84 degrees out
in Fahrenheit 29 Celsius and the phone
definitely feels warm in comparison to
my other phone I always use two phones
it feels a little bit hotter it's also
bigger it's a 6.7 inch display which is
definitely a little iPhone and also
bigger than a fear it's going to be
tried I'm dying the escalator right now
I still think it feels like pretty
pocketable and I think the bigger
display size means that you can kind of
enjoy it is
than last year and also it's a dynamic
High refresh rate people yeah that's
good it's good wow look at that effect
do they really care about their or
really don't it just makes the phone
feel fast like every action is fluid but
it is
reminds me of what Carl pay did with one
plus of really emphasizing the
performance of the phone over other
areas of the phone because I think that
when you pick up a phone if it feels
slow that gives you a really bad first
impression or Zach where do you think
the chocolate would be
oh so did we go upstairs for no reason
just because yes later is cool that's on
me
show you when you're recording video
that's really really I mean that's
interesting but what if you're trying to
spy on someone like how do you turn that
off
really cool I like that a lot I think
what's more important than design though
since most people ultimately put their
phone in a case is how it actually works
1 29 pm and the phone is at 45
I've been getting battery engines I
would be getting battery anxiety if that
happens nothing is optimizing for this
like intentional phone usage performance
oh how convenient of them
oh we made a phone like okay the battery
life is it's okay right but you know we
don't want you to be using it so much
so
you know if you're more intentional with
your device you'll get you'll get a day
and a half out of it
so it's a phone
that
is limiting you to be more intentional
that is shocking that that that that
that makes no sense whatsoever
um people in the chat please please come
in and comment because
we're in they're like we only want you
to use your phone when you want to use
the phone so that is we only want you to
use your phone when you use your phone
seeing in the fact that you can make the
phone monochrome wait when does he make
this because that story is like
so you make this yesterday or something
that makes
I've actually noticed that when I use my
phone monochrome I'm significantly less
likely
hit him on it
it kind of entices you a whole human
that's
good
ish
oh wait there's my phone all right it's
in this book here it is yeah that's a
new tip if you put your phone in the
book you won't
foreign
a lot of the time and I also really like
the software in like the widgets it just
looks like a fresh version of Android
it's really hard to create a version of
Android that feels as good or different
than stock Android and a positive oh
yeah speaking of that one UI six looks
to be getting a vertical application to
a more fully baked photograph at least
as well that isn't only from uh what's
it called
and I think that nothing has done that
so I
did something that isn't as great that
I've noticed is that this
skin so even though the display is Big
which is nice for media consumption
I feel like it's giving me a little bit
to be missed with speaker quality and I
miss it like walking around she's
supposed to be like using this the same
taxi is just
giving a review in a coffee shop but how
loud it is and how much it fills up a
room 2 16 p.m the phone is at a solid 44
percent
oh this Zoom is so rough I like can't
get over it it's Unique
that looks like it's from 2007.
you get us really decent solid video on
1X we'll see when we put on the Monitor
and please let me know also in the
comments what you think of it but
anything beyond like two three
nose dive falls off a cliff it's 3 30
and the phone is at 36
um that is not good
so we'll do the last
I feel like when you don't have
terrorist support it makes it very hard
for a consumer to be like seeking out
the phone a lot of people are not going
to know about it and people like you
know about it well lots of people know
about it I think that's true
it will feel like it's a brand risk to
take because they're a very new company
what is the customer service gonna be
like
do they have customers
what is the longevity of software
updates gonna be like it's a lot of
unknowns it's a big risk and so you kind
of have to be in the mindset of wanting
the two things that Carl pay and nothing
are optimizing for so it could be a good
deal even with all that said I'm really
hoping that so I guess it's a phone
that's designed first
but the designs on the back so you don't
have to use it you just look at it it's
a really nice art piece that you know
doubles as I found
which you can throw soup on
to protest the climate or something
nothing wins because I think having more
competition in the smartphone market and
especially a brand that fundamentally oh
I'd say made its own niche of
art based smartphones you aren't
supposed to use
so I wouldn't say that competition
but you know he cares about making
it matters a lot
oh yeah sure it is real fun to have a
phone that you don't want to use so you
can look at the back of its LED
sculpture
because when you're a small company you
can take more risks than you can when
you're a more established company it
means you have less money to spend on
those risks so you have to be more
strategic yeah but you have less to
spend but hypothetically you've a little
bit less to lose you can do more out
there things like having the back of the
phone be a light up phone and so I think
that honestly Samsung's just I don't
know have that an X right Galaxy X One
X2 X3 it would just be a brand that just
wild crazy smartphone ideas maybe I'll
do a vulnerable thing one time put
lights on the back of our phone for the
next time have 500 times optical zoom
for the next line
try stuff see if it works and then
integrate them into the Z and S lines a
few years later but but this x line will
be found
be available to use I mean this was kind
of what the a range was a little while
ago A90 plus 80. uh flip had a flipping
camera the first Samsung optical display
screen was uh Avon the first Samsung is
going to remove for four cameras with
some a phone what's my good phone but it
was still the first Samsung phone with
four cameras the first Samsung phone
with an optical display into my
fingerprint scan it was an iPhone but
then they kind of just like brought it
to the ass and made it there
and very clearly not too appeal to
everyone but to instead appeal to a
person that made the lower
mid-tier Android phone and people like
your psychology and as someone
I wouldn't call it a nothing phone a a
phone for people who love technology I
mean I don't think the phones boot
window is unlocked or anything like that
and I wouldn't call them Midway uh mid
tier it has a top tier process so I love
technology I was incredibly excited when
brilliant reached out to sponsor this
video
oh yeah that was incredibly excited that
it's going to be really difficult like a
lot of times more procrastinating
courses yeah that's great
um so great video to have them in TP
that's no ntp is not to be nothing but
Tech
um sorry we're not going to watch a
sponsorship video I hope you survive and
have a good dinner
um now we're going to go over to Marquis
brownlee's worst hot takes
he's perfect
you are the future oh oh I gotta say to
say this this is hilarious
wait wait sorry
um
pursuit tech careers with the DeVry
Scholars Program Advance your M oh I
didn't say that 500 degree
are these type of people like fishing
switch to Google Phi Wireless and get
simply unlimited our most affordable
Echo is behind the Galaxy Note 7 debacle
well I mean they didn't do a good job
think about it Samsung's still number
one
apple right after the Note 7 debacle in
2016. in 2018
to like fix people's iPhones because of
their battery draining thing so Apple I
mean if there are Apple's not a very
good at Mastermind
iPad should have a phone
okay that's not bad that's a good hot
take it should have a phone but after
those people will use it and it would
Samsung tablets have
[Music]
he made the best guns period That's a
debatable topic I mean they made a
really they made a 3D
camera first 4G phone for Android they
they made the HTC One M8 which is like a
much left phone so yeah I guess you
could say that
[Music]
Tech peaked in the early 2010s
I'd say the ideas of it peaked but
No One's Gonna say oh you guys that this
S2 is better than this
2022 but
I mean he has to I mean it was driving
interface and the s22 so it's kind of
like I generation
Samsung's ecosystem is better than
numbers that's debatable Samsung has
everything from a smartwatch to a tank
okay
the only thing they don't have is like
desktop computers they made like one so
that's debate I wouldn't say that's
[ __ ]
apples watches apples lists
[Music]
the Nexus 6 is still a phenomenal daily
driver
depending on what this guy's saying look
at the reach on that thing 50 000 people
saw that tweet wow
I mean did he Loop the phone and they
had a custom rom or like it depends on
what he did
LG was the most end of it that is true
that is true not name a company that
made a smartphone with half of this
place stick and got the side of it they
were a company that made a smartphone
with the vulnerable respect level at
least but they still made it name a
company that made a really good a dual
screen case for their mid-range LG
velvet LG V6 devices name a company that
had five cameras on the phone two on the
front three on the back
um in the LG v40 I think I have it right
right it's around this Summer that is
that is absolutely true and I wish there
was something else you hated because
maybe my clothes from my opinion LG V60
and I'm still music got stylus support
dual screen
[Music]
Microsoft do a super Android it too
if they need your life that's the truth
everything it's for the Microsoft kid
I don't see how this is awful how it
takes
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
on the internet for a long time and most
of it
at least where I hang out pretty
reasonable which is great but you know
there are some tucked away in the corn
once in a while that do have some pretty
controversial opinions things that they
actually believe in some
that are guaranteed to ruffle some
feathers
but sometimes there is some truth to
them so you think half those hot takes
don't do a base
today I've gathered oddest takes from
around the internet from you
hey what if I want you guys and we're
gonna see they're actually good takes on
that also I need to thank Jimmy hiroller
for the concept for this oh wow
his name if he didn't jxmy I was like
jimixi the studio if you haven't already
seen his channel he does a lot of
basketball videos including reacting to
NBA hot takes they're incredible so if
you somehow if you're interested in
basketball and somehow haven't seen this
channel already I'll link it below but
uh let's get into some tech hot takes so
here's a hot take Tesla
foreign
let me tell you the F-150 has been the
USA is 40th 40 something most longest
song truck
the blog is running most exciting trucks
not even shovel naked it's the Cyber
truck are you kidding me truck will
outsell the Ford F-150
by 2026.
he is insane thanks and this well this
is a hot one it's also long dead long
so the Cyber truck the Cyber truck is
one of the most hyped vehicles in a long
time as long as I've been alive
certainly the most hyped EV you know the
numbers speak for themselves
but now they're actually being spotted
around the roads around Tesla
headquarters and it seems like they're
finishing up details of manufacturing
and design and yeah um by the way it's
20 23. okay so let's say that this comes
out in 2024 an insanely high prices
insanely high prices right with like a
robust but not as robust is like I don't
know gas charging Network
um so insanely High advice with not as
robust gas you're trying to Dethrone the
longest running the the king of trucks
right now LS Ford goes on and does
terrible Edge which still
no and they may be about to finally go
into production with this thing now the
hot take is that it'll outsell the F-150
in three years because the F-150 as you
may already know is very popular but the
thing is
I don't know if you thought about this
as you're typing it I don't know if you
realize how popular the F-150 yeah
actually is the Ford F-150 has been
America's best-selling truck for 46. oh
my God
years in a row actually it's been the
number one most popular vehicle for 41
years straight last year Ford sold one
of these trucks every 49 seconds oh man
oh man why the aluminum alloy struggling
still it never Factory Advocate like
Savvy stop dropping the toolbox in by
the corner into your unbed lined truck
that's stupid and it typically totals
anywhere from 600 000 to just under a
million of these things every single
calendar year that's it so yeah the
Cyber truck very hyped and there are
allegedly somewhere in the neighborhood
of one and a half million pre-orders
which is crazy yeah but those might be
accounts
for a vehicle that's not even out yet
that only a hand even seen with their
eyes but a couple of things first of all
those pre-orders are 100
oh wow I can just pre-order one right
now deposits I know that because I'm one
of them you're actually hundred dollar
refundable deposits the point being one
and a half million half of those
probably kids
does not equal one and a half million
sales it's just it's just that many
people have reserved their spot in line
and some fraction of them will convert
percentage what if they're the same
people refer to orders but it won't be a
hundred percent and Tesla knows but then
number two you can't just build them all
at once you have to ramp up into
production we've seen this with other
models before so you know they'll start
off small a couple dozen one week then a
hundred the next week then 500 the next
week and they'll have to ramp up it'll
take a while to get through the first
million easily well over a year like at
this very moment Tesla doesn't even have
the capacity to make a million model
threes let alone a million of something
they've never made before so you know we
could be optimistic about the
manufacturing process but it is it's
going to be tough to get
tough
to a million of these things sold and
dethroning the King by 2026. so I love
the optimism about that cyber truck
possibly being one of the most
disruptive vehicles ever maybe could
happen but it's going to take a little
more time than that
bad take all right here's another one
apple now I mean maybe maybe not I I
don't use Apple Maps because
Samsung so it's debatable Maps is now
better than Google Maps get up to 150
off when you buy a set of four eligible
Bridgestone Tires
look at the weather
and this is this is a interesting tape
he says for the 7.99 Apple watch I'll
join you remember when Apple Maps first
came out like all the oh yeah people
were getting like lost dying we're not
dying because they almost died because
they got like ran into a link of the
horror stories the articles that all
came out how bad it was there were
entire towns missing there were places
that were just in the wrong spot it was
getting people lost driving them into
water it was it was seeing a ton of
features it was so bad that Tim Cook the
CEO had to issue
a lot of things have changed since then
basically I mean having a good maps app
requires a lot of mapping data so
they've been plugging away at that since
that launch of course all the street
view data the correct location data
businesses public transportation
different actual routes real-time
traffic all that stuff they've improved
dramatically but if they do go-time
tracks from all the iPhones using Apple
Maps
it's probably not that many people all
of that plus they've actually started
adding some genuinely cool features on
top of it I can actually vouch that if
you look at Google Street View and apple
map Street View in the same location
nine times out of ten the Apple Maps one
is actually higher quality and smoother
yeah it looks better it's easier to
navigate I also think Apple Maps is
generally better designed it's just a
little better looking than Google Maps
can you access it from a web browser
because if you can then we can use some
of that data and as of the latest IOS 17
beta it's actually finally getting one
of the biggest features that was missing
which is you're good
I use here we go maps for downloadable
maps I have the entire USA there's like
six gigabytes and then Google Maps it's
downloading maps for offline finally I'm
not ready to say that Apple Maps is
better than Google Maps yet I mean
especially because first of all it's
multi-platform it's just so much more
available and then the decades-long Head
Start that Google's had in mapping and
gathering information in the most
obscure parts of the world like it's
going to take some time yeah also Plus
codes like for people who don't have
addresses they can get a plus code well
I mean place that's a plus code but that
that could be coming to your address I'm
for Apple to continue to catch up with
that but I will say that it's at least
caught up to Google Maps they're on the
same level they're actually competitors
which is good because now they compete
to try to get better and for certain
people in some places sometimes it's
just as good if not better than Google
Maps there I said it
I said it it's a good take the Magic
Mouse is the best
for the Mac
that doesn't make sense because the
Magic Mouse
but I mean and of course it'll be better
minus for more Niche people so probably
not because it's like apples
uh you know y'all are really pushing
this one I
let's just ignore the take for a second
and just talk about them how does the
Magic Mouse exist like how is this the
best mouse that Apple the world's
richest three trillion dollar company
could come up with over billions of
dollars of research and development
dollars and the best is in the world and
all the testing and optimizations and
strategy on the planet this is the best
mouse that they could come up with
seriously sorry I should I should be
more objective here what makes a good
Mouse zoom out a little bit good design
good performance good features good
price the best Mouse cannot have a fatal
flaw in more than one of these
fundamental categories and we all know
about the fact that the only way to
charge it is a lightning port
an airport at the bottom of the mouse so
you literally can't even use it while
you're waiting for it to charge it might
only happen once a month but that's more
than it should ever happen but on top of
that it's also terrible ergonomically I
mean there's a reason why all the other
best mice in the world have an arch to
rest your hand but look older is a smart
guy I don't think he's trolling this is
not a completely empty take
the reason why people genuinely feel
this way about the Magic Mouse is
because Apple has done to this accessory
what they've done to every other
accessory that they possibly can in
their Universe which is making it
impossible to make a better one than the
Apple One literally cannot make a better
smart watch for the iPhone because
you'll never get as much access to the
data and the integration that Apple
gives its own watch you can literally
never make headphones that pair more
fluidly and switch more easily than
Apple's own oh speaking of headphones I
think they've
and the Magic Mouse
well the Magic Mouse has smooth
scrolling literally the best and only
good feature about the Magic Mouse is
that it has really smooth scrolling end
gestures so you can scroll up and down
with one finger and it just flows with
these so it's just a track
inertia of a touch screen like you can
toss web pages and apps around and catch
them with this smooth scrolling toss
them and catch them but drawing web
pages now you can two finger swipe
between spaces you can zoom in and out
of things it's just so smooth just like
a mouse should be and every single other
Mouse for Mac Scrolls in uh jittery
chunks basically because they literally
have to just pick an integer for how
many lines they want to scroll with
every unit scroll on the scroll wheel
it's just night and day difference
there's just no way for it to be as
smooth now this is also true about the
magic Trackpad which is actually why I
literally use one on my desk alongside a
good Mouse and I know plenty of people
who just use a trackpad and no mouse at
all so if you list if you really listen
to people who defend the map you'll
typically hear something along the lines
of well except for insert giant flaw
here it's a great Mouse and except for
come comfortableness it's it's amazing
yeah except for the whole charging on
the bottom thing which you only do once
in a while it's great
that's a pretty big thing for a mouse I
mean there's really not much that they
have to get right the Apple the Magic
Mouse is one of the most frustrating
Apple products
because it just it could be so good that
it they could with their trillions of
dollars they could just for a building
full of the best Mouse designers on the
planet they could they could buy
whatever people they want to design the
most incredible Mouse mankind has ever
seen
could have smooth scrolling but they
don't do it
they don't do it
I knew this was coming
it's a bad take tensor sucks and Google
should have stuck with Snapdragon all
right so
um
I hear that attention is good for
processing image data um put one back
now and it kind of gets overheated or
something I don't know but I wouldn't
say it sucks and this it's gonna get
better going forward so as something
comes over the tension and they drop
support for the pixel 5.
[Music]
[Music]
there are no words in this ad I I can
get behind half of this take not but
they switch to snap it sucks whole thing
but I can get behind half of this tensor
is great you know like two years ago
Google made this bold choice to move
from Qualcomm Snapdragon chips in their
phones to their own custom designed
tensorship that's actually built by
Samsung and the idea was to be able to
dedicate certain parts of the chip to
certain functions AI related or just you
know specific to the phone speech to
text things like that we are two
generations in now so we're at tensor G2
in the pixel and they have relatively
weak raw performance
and they also don't have great battery
life and they're not very efficient it's
like the pixels
get why people say tensor sucks but
I don't think they should have stuck
with Snapdragon I still think there's
time I still think in two or three
generations it could get to the point
where they have such good optimization
and such good calibration with exactly
what they want to do with these chips
that they'll be the most efficient best
battery life best experience something
that they could never have created by
just buying an off-the-shelf bunch of
Snapdragon ships so I think today I
meant to use older Snapdragon chips like
nothing to create optimizations like it
if today they literally offered a
Snapdragon Google pixel with a
Snapdragon hn2 and a tensor G2 I think
today I would pick the Snapdragon one
but I don't think they should just give
up on the tensor dream
okay yeah I mean if they give up nouns
all right beats are and have always been
very good often people pretend that
sound isn't incredibly subjective a
natural audiophilic sound is always less
enjoyable and more jarring outside of
pro referencing you know so you're
saying that pizza
when we bring up
a really good point
audio is subjective audio is definitely
subjective you know back in the days of
uh making fun of Beats headphones for
being overpriced garbage sounding
plastic there was always uh a little a
little kernel of Truth Underneath It All
which is that people still bought beats
all the time and enjoyed them and I
always found that fascinating that you
could literally tell people that there
there's another pair of headphones out
there that sounds better for half the
money and people in that world where it
seems like a totally straightforward
choice they would still pick the beats
and love them and recommend them and the
truth is like yeah for most people if
you just give them like their first pair
of nice headphones their first pair of
expensive headphones and they've got
this nice v-shaped equalizer a big
thumping bass and they're not really
thinking too hard about it being nice
and flat and a nice professional sound
they're going to be impressed it's going
to sound really exciting and interesting
for most music listening doing with
Beats headphones
it's great it's fine like audio is it
really is one of the most subjective
things in all of the tech world and
there are tons of reviews and studies
out there with countless examples of
this it kind of feels like the only
truths of reviews and studies out there
with countless examples
of this it kind of feels like the only
trait in audio that people universally
find in problems examples of this it
kind of and there are tons of reviews
and studies out there with countless
examples wait a two people just got the
link to this feels like the only trait
in audio that people universally find
impressive is just loudness just higher
volume but kind of across the board
anyone can kind of enjoy any sound
signature and generally headphones these
days are good enough to have an EQ and
be able to sound differently based on
different types of music and movies and
whatever you're doing now all that being
said I don't think I could still say
that beats have always been very good I
they've at some point in the past that
they were definitely a much more
expensive cheaply built version of the
average headphones you could kind of
just get anywhere else but the marketing
team
has always been very good that has
always been good so I think yeah decent
headphones today
decent take also side note I continue to
be so fascinated by the behavior of them
as a company like beats since they've
been purchased by Apple and the newest
pair of Beats by Dre
hello I'm back internet went out for a
little bit
um all right we just have a few more
stories back uh again we gotta talk
about uh World coin some type of Bitcoin
um
let me share the screen with you
CEO of world coin coming aims to scan
the eyeballs of every human on this says
a global World idea is coming whether
you like it or not probably the next
couple of years
um no we're not gonna do that
um oh yes I forgot greetings from the
real estate in America
um
let's see yeah so we probably want to do
that and
just before we leave don't forget that
uh anniversary live stream is next week
we want to be you know I want to see a
hundred people in this chat
simultaneously all live chatting with
each other I want to have a good party
in here and maybe we can uh Link in some
uh donations for buying me a coffee to
see if we can get to a hundred dollars
drowning purpose and a little more than
dollar per person because they take a
small cut and before we leave let's
check into that app what's called veeps
Beats
uh let's see
let's see
Vibes v e e b s
all right
it's from VBS Corp LLC
uh there you go so I don't know maybe
it's like vacation bible school or
something the app looks really bad looks
like it's designed in 2008 I'll give you
that
um
why is my phone screen all that high
okay uh the the publisher they only make
one application
it has a two and a half star rating in
the Play Store five thousand downloads
um and it looks
very bad oh my goodness this looks trash
um before we um look at that maybe you
know books can be deceiving I don't even
know how that got into that App Store to
be honest
um let's talk about this Tick Tock trend
about uh we'll talk about the tick tock
gym lady
um let's see
[Music]
okay I'm opening the application
let me see where is the
oh here it is
threads threads everyone's favorite
social media application
um has imposed a rate limit on its uh
people and I'm pretty sure people are
going to get this mad about it when they
do about oh about Twitter
um yeah so threads and Roses are right
in the mix because they want to fight
spam so it's becoming Twitter 2.0
interesting no I guess about threads all
right now on to the application and it
already has signs of bad design in order
to exit the app like normally if you
wanna
like
it's a
that go back you press the back button
or for you people out there who use
gestures gesture off but then you get
this dialogue that says do you want to
close the app and
container which is just bad at design
anyway all right you have to create an
account
dang you have to add your email address
and phone number
why are you email address and phone
number well let's test this out all
right remember my email address is
contact at techpoint.org
okay I put my email address and phone
number in and it's sending the same code
to my text
and and the input field is kind of bad
so
um
I I'd say we're not getting off to a
good spot uh start let's see
and my code is 7709 okay so we're gonna
I'm gonna scroll over seven seven on
that it
the app just let me get through without
putting my verification coded okay so
really bad design right here but let's
check
create my profile oh I still have to
create my profile
so it's just pretending to let me okay
no
no
no okay I want to create my profile yes
I'm gonna post the app I want to open it
again oh man all right so I had to put
my in uh email address in contact with a
look
and I picked my phone my phone go ahead
okay
it's gonna send the activation code
again one five one one five one one
submitting
all right zip code
so that gender male adult female okay uh
and then my both two let's see how far
it lets me go oh okay uh my boat view is
going to be uh 2008 for this
all right track my values pack
okay these are the values that they have
here
you know if you can see
um I I don't even know half of those
even though
wait so it's
okay whatever
wait dragging and dropping is slow and
that vibration all right there we go
okay whatever
select favorite stores
if you got Walmart Safeway can I put a
location in I thought we would have
Safeway in my life okay a little bit
Walmart at number two oh you can't
okay right after uh Target
um let me think no
um HCB HEB is going number one I guess
I thought who would have half these
pick and save Dylan's wrath Market
District okay I'm gonna put Randalls at
number two people in the chat
um
who made it
Bonds hours since the Giants fries food
never heard of it okay
um where's Walmart where'd it go okay
okay so that's subscription
you have to subscribe for No One's Gonna
pay for this app no one
let's see what their privacy policy says
opens up a web page
like okay look like my location because
we gave it to them like virals don't
sell GTP or okay
okay fine we've got the screen after
giving them like signing up uh see
okay so for premium you have to pay 99
of not a sign since a month okay so I'm
gonna say no all right let me make a
shopping list okay according to my
values
um that they gave me for Chris very
short
um
I'm gonna name this list test
submit it it's also like some type of
Barcode Scanner in here
okay I need to add some
I don't know X
um okay
they have eggs over it
okay I want some egg ones best eggs
and I'm cage-free I don't know and then
what store do I want it from a simple
truth to store
okay Land O'Lakes
and their score is locked
so this app just makes you let's make a
shopping list
but the values part of the app
it
is
a dollar a month
for it is badly optimized badly
developed applications
so zero Stars
optimization and development one of the
best optimized applications for some
reason it's been going down right
recently NCP still the best social
network but
that's it
I don't want you ending up like thieves
that looks
terrible
like a trash
all right
um that's all for now I'm not going to
go as long maybe we'll go longer next
week
um if anyone has any Tech stories about
to suggest let me just check YouTube to
see if there's anything there because
veebs Vibes looks absolutely in this
um let's see I'm I'm live
obviously
yeah that's all so God bless Tech talk
to you later don't forget to subscribe
to the channel
and that's all</pre>
