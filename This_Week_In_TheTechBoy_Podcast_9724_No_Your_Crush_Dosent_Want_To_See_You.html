<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 9724 No Your Crush Dosent Want To See You</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to this
weekend The Tech booy podcast as you can
see um things have changed up a bit and
Max you're going to change the camera
view here so that this is the regular
camera and this
is the laptop camera which actually
looks a lot better A lot less grainy I'm
not sure you guys tell me which one you
like but we uh recently got a new laptop
so we're going to be testing um that out
today it is a HP Envy
X360 um with A3 generation Intel i7 in
it all right so let me go over the
comparison to the galaxy book
um the galaxy book that I had previously
all right so just got it today but
um
it it does have some improvement so it
does have stylist capability I do like
that the stylist doesn't use like a
doublea battery or anything like that it
actually uses uh us C charging if I can
pull off the cap right there has a USBC
charging port in here speaking about
USBC and it actually docks magnetically
on the side side of the laptop on the
right side here I do wish that it um
charge magnetically but maybe that will
come out next year who knows it has two
um USBC ports on the side which is more
than the Galaxy book um pad so I'm
thankful for that and it also has a
fullsize Micro SD card slot uh two usba
a ports as well so those are all great
things um I do wish it was a Micro SD
card slot um but I guess I can just get
an adapted because I don't have any full
size I just have Micro SD card slots um
from previous phones phone and uh my
microscope right here um the camera
quality as you can see is excellent I'm
not sure about the microphone quality
but the speaker quality is really good
um I compared this this to um to the
Samsung Galaxy S uh galaxy book galaxy
book um and playing the same song in the
wild um by the the VBS theme song at the
let me see at the one minute mark it was
at 71.6 DB Samsung and at the 1 minute
14 second Mark was at 87.1 DB now
compared to the HP at the 56 minute Mark
56 second Mark um it's basically the
same thing it's at 77.3 DB and at the
114 it's at 85.3 DB so it's like a four
to six decible Improvement at 50% volume
right there and you can definitely hear
it I do believe that's because of the um
one of the bad things about not having
uh using the other camera is that I
cannot move it so I'm going to switch
back again is that it has
um front facing speakers right there
instead of
um speakers like towards the bottom all
right another thing that is beneficial
about this is the specs a lot more r um
more storage that has a terabyte instead
of
um this stus must be out of battery has
a terabyte of storage compared to say uh
one
gig sorry instead of a half a terabyte
of storage which was really slowing down
the computer um the screen size is
bigger but that's I guess that's it it
depends on you now as for build quality
the Samsung's actually a lot better in
terms of build quality the keys here are
plastic um they were on Samsung too but
the frame is also plastic as well so
it's a lot more flex and Creak and
typing is a lot louder though I might be
a bit more accurate on here do it more
spread out I do wish it had a numpad
though um it would be nice to like kind
of input the numbers by via stylist
speaking of The Stylist The Stylist just
feels like you're typing glass on glass
um the Samsung S stylist it wasn't
compatible on the Samsung laptop um it
felt a little bit more um realistic
Maybe because of the this is rubber and
this is it's more of like a hard plastic
right so Samsung Samsung stylist is
better than HP um the twoin one
functionality is should be good I
haven't really tested that out yet
though I'm glad that it actually works
compared to this as as you can see the
hinge oh we can't see it there we go the
hinge was broken and that broke
touchcreen functionality as well all
right um the camera quality is
absolutely a lot better and it does
support Windows hello face recognition I
do miss the figure print scanner so I
don't have Windows hell face recognition
turned on just too much face data you
know of me online could probably be
easily hacked to I'm not sure I don't
have like a big print out of myself or
anything um but that's just what Windows
hello face lock in I'll probably buy a
fingerprint scanner um and plug it into
one of the USBC ports speaking of USBC I
do like that it charges over USBC so it
can also charge my phone and you still
have another USBC Port free as well you
got HDMI so it's actually doing PS
pretty well here it's better than Apple
um it is a pretty a bit heavy though so
um watch out for that all right it's
running Windows 11 home I want it for
but um I guess I have to pay for the
upgrade for that too and I've installed
um some applications on here to test it
out so we got a
blendo
um I want to test out the 32 GB of RAM
and I'll probably install some offline
artificial intelligence applications as
well so but for now I am liing the
laptop it's doing pretty well um for
itself it doesn't look like it's
experiencing any con connectivity issues
that I had in the beginning um it's
paired my Bluetooth really well um I
hope that quick share comes over here
even though it's not a Samsung this is
actually my first yeah this is my first
non Samsung laptop that's
actually wild um because my first
laptop um was a Galaxy Chromebook of 16
GB writes of storage um and then the
next laptop was
a galaxy book tablet it ran Windows 4
gab of ram 128 gab of storage it had a
keyboard case I used it until the case
stopped working so then just was like a
tablet was kind of slow it did have stus
capability I brought a third party one
um and then I switched to an HP once but
then I sent it back account and then I
got the Galaxy book um
13.3 Flex Alpha it's been really good
with laptop just kind of slowed down
over time so this is my first nons
Samsung laptop ever see um how well it
does and you know I'm looking forward to
making great content with this and maybe
I'll be able to even transfer some of my
editing over to this laptop than on my
phone because technically the phone was
more powerful than the laptop in terms
of CPU and RAM and Luma Fusion is just
excellent excellent so hopefully I can
find something like that over on um on
on Windows um I do have quel draw but
it's a video editing software that I
paid for it's it's okay all right
um oh yes we're going to look ahead
towards the future November 1st on
November 1st we will be having a special
podcast episode hope I can pull up the
thumbnail here let see if I can pull it
up on the screen
and the browser on this laptop is
actually pretty good too um in compared
to screen sharing and stuff so yeah
November 1st 2024 uh same time just
going to be on a Friday um we're going
to continue to Loop be return to normaly
um so as you guys remember kids are like
weeds they're resilia that podcast
episode from what was it April March
yeah we're going to be finishing out the
Saga as we rejoin in TV all right
speaking of NTB um they've had some
great great stories coming out of them
um today actually I want to congratulate
them for writing a prot tech article in
response to W House's anti-tech article
so congratulations and of course we got
to talk about I have a whole desk we
have a whole thing planned up today we
have things about tech and Tech culture
um I did some research into that but I I
want to congratulate Planet [ __ ] who on
NB um for for for writing this article I
mean it is it was simply a beautiful
article almost but tears tears to my
eyes um
let me let me put it up
here man I have a lot a lot of stuff
here
um oh man it's taking a long time to get
here sorry let me just uh let me just
put it up on the screen guys make sure
you guys comment and and like and stuff
like that
let me so as as I'm pulling this up on
the screen I hope you guys um enjoy what
we talking about oh yes yes here it is
uh the the title is this WAP house
contribute to five-year journey and
adopting flip phone to isue the
trappings of Modern Life is unint hum I
need it for my week and as you guys know
usually usually and we talked about this
last week they always usually like ban
ban ban ban ban ban social media ban
cell phones ban the internet you know
that that's that's basically the Hello
Elijah welcome to the stream um as you
guys know it always like ban ban ban
internet
um they're like we we got to get the
kids off of this blah blah blah but I am
so glad and so pleased to share this
take of You by Planet [ __ ] one of my
favorite writers over on the site um
hopefully you guys can see this on the
screen
um yes so he's actually criticizing a
wowow it's normal normal they always
criticize wow in nyt um over 5e journey
and adopting a flip from the Sho of
trapping and Modern Life and it's
beautiful it it is this is the most one
of the most beautiful articles I've ever
seen on this site all
right so here's the ryer he says I
switch to flip phone and dramatically
improved my well-being obviously you
didn't switch to this kind of flip phone
it came out of a 2003 and obviously it
wouldn't work all right so he says um he
goes for Ying Ying for the day is gone
by 15 years ago let's see planet War are
you correct it is as of taping date 2024
15 years ago would have been
um what
2009 yeah 2009 so smartphones were still
a thing you know the iPhones came out
but you know flip phones flip phones
hadn't was still the number one in the
country back then all right he says I
felt empty and frustrated about how much
time spin on my iPhone and plan up more
on instead of saying he download this
scam app that tells you to get off your
phone and makes you pay $4.99 he says
and and this is this is great this is
great right there he says he could do
something radical like stop spending so
much time on your iPhone and this is
where the article end right now but no
he says treat himself like a small child
and take away those Temptations but
which he simply does not have the
maturity to
handle and this is great I mean Planet
[ __ ] has I mean he has literally said
on on on the site that he his child has
a phone and he's has and it's Tik Tock
and ail so I really like how he's going
against the status quo of of the site or
was like B ban ban yeah let's go so I'm
really glad about that um really really
thankful for that all right um speaking
of one of the things I like about the
stylist is that it works while it's
charging all right so it says you
reduced your $900 smartphone to a half
decent camera and a really crappy
flashlight
a said he stripped social media email
apps and internet browsers exactly some
people just don't understand what the
point of smartphones um are and of
course we're going to have to try to
figure out how we're going to integrate
you know this into the lineup after we
have you know a decent laptop that
actually works um but but he said it was
liberating like the prin in the closing
days of World War II only the beget were
not as good and in essent incessant
check to check my phone strength smaller
and smaller I mean that makes sense
since as he stripped and I quote social
media email news apps and internet
browsers which um if I stripped that
from my phone which the I mostly use
email internet browsers and I guess news
websites um all we have here is video oh
and apps so um anything that's not
pre-installed on the phone has to go so
we got video I guess technically we have
minor photo editing here we have um we
got a clock an LA in a voice recorder
that's it guys oh let's see I I just in
the comment here I personally probably
need to set sorry I personally probably
need people wow that's a tongue twister
right there set a time Lim for me
because I don't really have
self-control
interesting I'd get we of NTB trying to
mandate that though all right oh wait
got another comment coming
in oh no it's just glitch okay um oh and
a flashlight of course yeah the
flashlight is built in to the camera
okay is let's see what else we have here
um he says person ignores Lucas's
complete lack of anything resembling
willpower and personal agency he said he
considered switching to a flip phone for
some time and then revealed he teached a
c a course on purpose in community and
he says he talks about how phones can
get in the way of life and I actually
like Planet War for pushing back here
and saying it's not the phones it's not
the phones the phone is just a tool
sorry for the awarding it's okay yes yes
exactly I don't support the mandation of
Technology if you guys go over to um our
teenagers or our high school you know SS
of idiots but you know there's some some
good stuff there which is why I'm not
against which why I'm against Banning it
of course um you see all these kids
talking about how phones getting banned
in schools supp I'm not for that as well
it seems like there's this huge backlash
that didn't really need to happen all
right and he he shouldn't be teaching
this course yeah yeah it says two of his
students dipped the smartphones and got
flip phones which prompted Luc to get
the same and I would like to know what
kind of model flip phone he got because
are some flip phones
that are in
Verizon um they still technically have
internet access as well which means he
would do more than his current iPhone um
because he's restricted internet access
as well all right um he said texting is
terribly slow so you call people and
have a delightful stream of five minute
phone conversations throughout the day
and as that seems very inconvenient
especially if you're like driving or in
public transit um also
this actually gives me another reason to
like smartphones which is just the full
quy keyboard that's really an
achievement back then I guess we can
talk about um what people were doing
with smartphones back in 2007 after we
get through this all right he says I'm
so glad Lucas doesn't have my number can
you imagine hey just call and say hi
again Watch up to see any new movies and
says bro I'm at work all right so what's
really delightful about Mar texting is
the convenience and we really have to
talk about texting um I got have to talk
about this in relation to our Snapchat
um story that we have to talk about oh
actually I have a hot take about texting
and Snapchat and stuff like that people
are busy I can ask my brother a
non-urgent question share a picture or a
place real time um the average phone
call is like the long distance phone
call of the past is probably important
if I want to have a delight from five
minute phone conversation I can text
first mainly so they don't assume that
someone ins died all right so that's
good or if you insist you can call
instead of text you get to choose not
your phone and that's what that's great
I mean basically Planet war is basically
setting up the phone to be the
smartphone to be the phone of personal
Choice freedom and responsibility so uh
the libertarian phone I guess uh you get
restant recommendations from your
conversations with your neighbors rather
than through Yelp too bad you can't do
that when you have a smartphone and I
really like how Planet [ __ ] is parall
p in sorry um per whatever the the
smartphone to um to to to choice and
it's really it's really great actually
um because he's showing that like with
the flip phone you only get this one
option you can call but with the
smartphone you got this other option and
this this this article actually
reinvigorated me for the hope of
smartphones like it it made me just
simply Marvel at the technology we have
all compressed into $1,200 device or
even a $200 device right smartphones
smartphones are amazing okay the Epic
spy tools epic toys just just epic all
around I mean this this D why power does
not know that you can own a smartphone
and to your neighbors which is kind of
ironic because Ral is owned by Jeff
Bezos who is the CEO of Amazon who made
a phone 10 years ago they said know
about that it was it was fire but yeah
okay you don't scroll in line right at
the grocery store instead talk to the
person helping you check out honestly
that is such a waste of time like you
have a job you're trying to do something
just just get through it also who
Scrolls in line you might be looking at
the grocery list or something besides
there these things Great Inventions not
to have wow knows about them they're
call Pockets you can put your phone in
there all right
um it says nine times out of 10 the
person checking you out does not want to
talk to you exactly ex exactly no one
cares okay and know that I want to hear
about your great design recipe that your
grandmother gave you either and I'm so
glad that planet [ __ ] brings this up
okay he's not he's not like one of those
you know those blogs like guys we should
detached ourselves from our smartphones
and and and really reconnect with the
people in front of
us and
um it it's just so much better no one no
one cares I'm so glad that you actually
brought the fact that no one actually
cares it it's it's beautiful all right
just thank you this one of the greatest
articles it says if the check out person
is in the chatting mood you should be
able to pick up on that and you can
leave your smartphone in your pocket and
check with talk with them yeah
exactly you can study maps at home
before driving somewhere new and then
see what happens you might get a bit
lost and it's great and I know been full
essays because people don't have much
time has too much time on their hands um
about the joys of getting lost and just
driving anywhere and
everywhere yeah no no and Planet [ __ ]
he he claps back he says getting lost Is
Not Great getting lost makes you late
which can inconvenience others in worse
it's stressful and dangerous back in the
day he was driving around some friends
from DC to Baltimore it's like what
three- hour drive one o00 in the morning
after seeing some bands re liked at a
downtime club we knew the area we looked
at maps and they got lost and I'm so
glad
that he's glad about the the greatness
of GPS and American Technology and hello
Cher Cheryl Fortune um welcome to the
show um I'm so
glad
um that that that that um that that he's
there and he says the smartphone is not
preventing him from doing things he says
that he is and I'm so
glad that um that that he he calls him
out on this ridiculous assumtion that
using a flip phone is charming and
romantic no using a flip phone is slow
outdated in people are going to look at
you okay I wouldn't really call that
charming and
romantic
um maybe 15 years ago where it is a new
era a new a new time oh let's see what
Elijah says he says it sounds teesy but
I do agree that it's better to have
impul and connection to people as much
as possible yeah I mean that that's fine
but I mean the smartphone wasn't pring
him from doing that I mean but the
screen wasn't getting up and like
smacking in the face whenever you know
he wanted to talk to someone he says my
favorite example happened at my school
son School sign your kid in you have to
scan a QR
code and now he has a friendly chat with
two School Employees that he would never
meet before because he um that that um
that that scan QR code and he seems to
convince that building employees with
work is a Net game because his presence
is the Highlight is their day or
something um you know I think there's a
joke that can be um in here I'll put in
editing post production all right uh
what what what want to meet people at
your son School get involved volunteer
sh whatever need it then instead of
being a burden you like a
help okay okay okay I'm not gonna say it
I'm not gonna say it I'm not gonna say
it I'm gonna
[Music]
put I hope I spelled that right there
you go um chat went through let's go all
right um he said get involved volunteers
sh and whatever whatever's needed and he
says like what wow this guy's
evangelizing our lifestyle he's assuming
his pathologies I was I don't know I
don't pay for wow I don't pay a dollar a
month um so you know I only have like
what one free article from them maybe
four and they and I used them on their
Tech column Wu wait is W nyt or what
well W is W from wow why use up one of
these people for for the TCH sex and it
says as it says our addiction to
smartphone is not just on an individual
level and he tries to blame the the the
um millions of I don't know how many
people weat wow I'm not sure but he
tries to blame the millions of wow redos
uh for his addiction he says in L we
built STS to depend on smartphone
access true is but you can get around it
it says first of all it's 100%
intentional besides why do you think
that is and he says but like the vast
majority of people I like not having to
sit at a desk and but pay bills on a few
typ not getting lost in the middle of
the night I like knowing what going to
rain as I'm walk my dog these things
save me time and trouble and open up
opportunities for more productive things
and this is the greatest defense the
greatest argument for having
smartphones in in society and not
Banning them until your 18 like it's a
drug or or alcohol till you're 21 but
whatever um but I mean this is this is
the greatest I mean article of all time
he says like While most most
inconvenience of
charming uh
I don't know if it's a bad copy or if he
typed wrong maybe he refering to the
toilet paper they sound inconvenient and
some of them are so festic that to make
you want to pull your hair out I know
what you mean have you tried something
at Telegraph lately which um telegrams
you can still in digital telegrams now
um yeah but um I have a list here we
have plenty to talk about today probably
going to go hit the twoh hour Mark um I
actually like that the clock on the
computer is accurate I mean my Samsung
computer was dying um all right we we
have a full notes here today and we're
going to talk about what's let's see
what's up on
the
um let's see what let's see what comes
up here on the screen um we we have we
have plenty plenty to talk about today
um oh Mr who the boss bot built his the
world's largest iPhone he actually got a
world record for that so um we've we've
talked about um
but oh yes yes okay we need to talk
about an anti-tech stance from um let me
from uh Pro protest Pro protesta
protesta um the popular
Evangelical people who go around and
um who go around and
basically um find videos of church
services that they don't like and then
tell the people why they don't like them
um some of them are good some of them
are funny and some of them are just
horrendous takes I mean
horrendous and I'm about to show you one
of the horrendous uh takes um from PHA
as well
um let me see where I am
from I really should like start just
screenshotting wish pixel screenshots
worked on non-pixel
devices
um I have used uh I I've downloaded it
before but it doesn't it doesn't search
through oh yes here it is I found it
here um so Elevation Church which is a
church around United States I don't know
how many places that they have but this
is at one of the Elevation Church
locations and this is the Tech Booth
they have behind it I've been behind the
tech Booth before it's really
interesting you actually you know do
something you keep your mind you know
productive and working it's form of you
know worship you're helping the people
out and you're you know doing your your
duty but instead of um instead of um um
I'm saying hey this is great and you can
see that they're singing right here yeah
have I mean this is actually awesome
using computers like this this this
doesn't this look awesome doesn't this
look epic but instead of being like hm
awesome epic that's great good for them
I mean look at these camera angles and
the clock and stuff like that I mean
this is better than like I mean maybe CN
in right and they're like another view
from inside the sound rooms Elevation
Church and then all the people get up
and criticize them and I say why can't
we use the same Tech using Fox News CN
whatever news program to glorify God I
mean how is this how is this even
objectively wrong like please
please this this looks absolutely
amazing what are they doing there I mean
this is great and we got Max you got
Windows um it's it's it's amazing um I I
I honestly don't know what what's wrong
with them but that's why I'm so glad to
see people actually coming back to the
prot tech side the the pro smartphone
article as well speaking of pro
smartphone I made another parody ad
parodying the um smartphones of
um paring the phones so hope you guys
can see this on the screen this is a
parody ad of basically those stupid dumb
phones that people try to sell for
$400 are you tired of having a
supercomputer in your pocket do you hate
taking pictures do you hate instant
communication with your friends do you
hate access to the internet to do
research video chat watch TV or play
games well you are in luck now
introducing airphone 1 airphone 1
developers built a custom OS that has no
internet no no apps no Maps no camera
and no fun and as you can see on the
screen if you were watching this say on
a phone and didn't have the the thing
covering it up it says it's based on
cheap Android 4.4 phone it probably has
mware and custom software it just blocks
apks I mean distractions be in the
moment experience life do you like
getting lost do you like being isolated
do you like buying pieces of junk I mean
Joy so much joy buy airphone where our
tagline is less for more less battery
less proc processing less features and
more money for US airphone 1 is
available on the peppermint Mobile store
for
$799 with an insane pre-order deal of
only
$399 experience life with only one app
it's the airphone I mean honestly this
has got to be one of the greatest uh
videos of all time um probably second
behind the meam video on the Snapchat um
story thing all right so um speaking of
snap chat and texting there was a
Snapchat
uh thing I don't know what you call them
fake texting where this uh was someone
hacked into someone's Snapchat and was
pretending to be their girlfriend to see
if they were cheating on them or
something like that it's snap the people
who write those stories don't know what
they're talking about but this got me to
thinking as know um texting is
discouraged because of ss7
vulnerabilities in the network because
you know hacking and can be intercepted
right I was thinking like let's say you
you're an
adversary you're an adversary of
um of of of in in the school right it's
more likely like we've gone through this
that kids are probably using snap than
um what's it call just regular SMS and
using phone numbers right which makes
snap a more attractive Target and
because SMS usually we're talking about
regular SMS here iMessage isn't
accessible over the internet right You'
have that directly hack into their phone
to access the SMS and you have to do it
repeatedly multiple times because you
you need have to set up SMS foring right
but with Snapchat you can log in via the
web right I was thinking like what if
someone um that pretended to like give
you the Snapchat because maybe you had
like a crash on them or something right
and um it with the like little snap QR
code things and it actually fish your
credentials or
uh or they tricked you into clicking the
notification and they got access to all
your chats online I was thinking like H
would that make and and expose you like
maybe try to run for like 11th grade
present or something and then expose you
and your popularity goes down into the
polls and Cass or whatever or they
blackmail you whatever they do in the
snap stories my stories a lot more
realistic than those stupid snap stories
but whatever right or even if they have
physical access to your phone like if
they have SMS they'd have to physically
download an app set up SMS foring right
put in the password of it's an iPhone
not not if it's an Android um or if they
have physical access to your phone for
like five minutes because remember that
woman who was just going around and like
hi can you get my I want your Instagram
and they're typing in and she was
actually secretly signing them up for
newsletters that they didn't want
um which is stupid um I don't know why
you give your phone to some random lady
off the street I mean but I mean teens
probably that to other people like hey
can I get your snap and they start
typing in whatever but you get physical
access to the phone for five minutes you
type the notification in forgot pass it
right fix it with email or SMS and now
you have access to all the messages I
mean if you think about it SMS from a
teenage perspective not from like a
governmental perspective if you're
getting targeted by the government over
um or like from professional hackers
that can trace and SMS the phones
Snapchat Instagram and all these other
applications are actually less secure
than than these other
and that is um primarily uh
communication form used by teenagers so
I mean hey maybe we're on teams here
people anyway um but speaking about
something that's even more realistic um
and even worse there's a Snapchat scam
that's going around and um people are
playing praying on teens's unrealistic
dreams and expectations of course of
course um we did a we did a song about
this uh we we did a video about this so
they have these people um influences are
being scammed people from Tik Tok and
Instagram I don't know who they are but
I face searched them so I could elud
them and some of them got back to me but
there is this scam where they're like
want to see all your crushes photos
click this link and it's in the Snapchat
ad right and they have this like woman
who's just like from a different video
who's doing like some dance moves or
something like that and I'm like what
what what are you doing but the dance
whatever um but actually the link
somewhere somewhere else so here's a
video I did about this the influencer is
not affiliated with the
skin questiones are a threat to National
Security again so you got this allegedly
aesthetic person here who's running this
scam ad watch I created a cyber security
app that can find any photo on the
internet in seconds that's not how ENT
works that's not how cyber security
works you can't yeah you can't yeah you
can't just type someone's name in here
then put in the age right so an
influencer she's being like ripped off
she's not really saying anything that's
from a picture from Instagram or
something like that right and and and
and and they also are feeding off of
like monetary scams too digital
marketing scams and like some random I
honestly I don't really know how these
scams are staying up so long people
probably actually following for them
like some random you cannot type
someone's name in and be
like and and all the pictures just
magically pop up like you have a better
T of using Instagram for that in some
random website and um
yeah so guys watch out for scams um of
that nature all right
um I do not know what what jingy is
doing or thinking and also don't know
how people actually thought they would
fall for that scam ad oh wow Mr mobile
released a um released a video today but
we're gonna get to the next video uh Mr
who's the
boss um he made a large iPhone the
world's largest iPhone in the world
actually hopefully you guys can see this
on the screen we're going to react to
this and um popular Tech um YouTuber
Haley's World um appeared on the stream
so without further Ado Mr is the
boss and mean let's look at the specs
the specs on this device this is the
greatest iPhone in the world has ever
seen we've working on it for over a year
now while we've been racing to over over
for year oh man so he announced this but
he he knew he was going to do it anyway
take app and subscribers and now that we
just passed them it's time to show the
world three two one wait isn't that
insane that he passed up Apple in
subscribers I mean that kind of makes
sense speaking of Apple is having an
event I think I'm having it
Monday there you go this thing is built
from scratch it's the actual as you can
see here it's actually running Android
um you can see from that voice search
icon there Apple wasn't going to help
them out um unfortunately oh let's see
we got Mao YT um hello Mao wow we got
six people up here wow super computer of
smartphones and there are seven things
it can do that will make your current
phone look like a toy like for example
the
first look at that stand they say it's
like 200 kilograms uh I believe that's
insane this is no normal phone camera oh
actually I just remembered we have a
peel to do world's largest phone peel in
three two
[Music]
one I like how it kind of looks like a
tablet a little bit but when you when it
around increase the size of their
sensors by 10 store London yeah is
they're using an actual camera in here
two actually one for zoom and one for um
Regular shots and they use the Wi-Fi
link and pay for data just to exess
mine's bigger so this is the camera app
and Because the actual camera itself is
locked away on the inside what we've had
to do here is to get a sim and a very
real data plan so that we can use
Canon's Wi-Fi link app to have a live
feed of what the camera is seeing in
real time all right let's go looks very
slow oh this feels good I mean just look
at the differen I mean and I know the
display is probably not displaying as
well but I mean look at the skin quality
here compared to the skin quality um
there I mean he looks washed out detail
the warmth of the colors and just how
cinematic are
though to the size it's not that good of
an increase because this is like a camer
you can hold in your hand so compared to
the size of the Samsung of the of the
actual iPhone uh it's not punching at it
weight class like it should be you
should be able to take pictures of the
Moon from there and see the boots
astronauts left looks in comparison also
if you're curious about the video
quality I don't think I've ever looked
this pretty before and because this is
an 8K resolution recording we've
absolutely smoked the Apple iPhone in
terms of
detail um I like to see compare against
to say Samsung I want to see what kind
of 8 I know Samsung get to ak30 I think
this might be
ak60 also if you're wondering why
there's a single Macho plaster on my
face it's because I walk straight into a
pole while heing this Beast of a phone
around London but every topend
smartphone also has a zoom camera and of
course we need to top that as if you see
me Shak zoom and now on the big we so 20
that's the iPhone at 25 times Zoom I
mean you can kind of make her out five
times is the maximum amount of digital
zoom and now on the big iPhone we can't
see her very well the feed quality isn't
the best but zoom and zoom and zoom
there she is let's
capture oh my goodness look at that I
mean this kind of looks decent I guess
like see still kind of looks a bit fake
but I'm just look at that background
what is this 2007 I probably don't need
to explain why ours is
better so what is powering this phone
well you might know that Apple
themselves have a very closed controlled
way of making products which means that
the only way to actually run iOS is to
buy an iPhone you can't run iOS on I
thought they might use like a whole
bunch of iPhones and kind of like scale
them up but no they didn't do
that any other device so this is
actually running Android with many many
different applications and skins to make
it look as close to IOS as possible
running Android many this is the first
iPhone that runs
turo many different applications and
skins to make it look as close to IOS as
possible it looks like they did a good
job um they don't have any of that
stupid ads in there so great job that's
not a quirk that's a feature yeah
because Android is so much more open
what it's allowed us to do is to
basically build a very high-end PC on
the inside to power it and that took a
lot of trial and error we I'd also like
to know how I can use that computing
power um of course you know it has to
drive this huge massive screen which is
actually a TV um uh 88 inch TV but I
like to see like let's say if you put
like say Luma fuse on it or something
how will it perform to a current Android
Flagship tried the latest Nvidia RTX
490 but no luck we have to do a lot of
experimentation also look at the phone
app it looks like a backd of banana
correct Hardware configuration for this
and just to give you some perspective
the absolute best iPhones have 8 GB of
RAM and a tiny little mobile ship our
iPhone has
128 GB of RAM that's as much storage as
my first Windows
computer it has the AMD 6950 XT
dedicated graphics card and a 24 core
Intel so we in the very heart of London
people are starting to gather around I
feel like a street performer but I think
what everyone is here to see is a
benchmark okay so 3D Mark is the extreme
stress test it's going to be quite tough
I'm going to go Wildlife extreme we
explain this to people it's not like
this an app that people just have on
their phone you know all the time you
know people are just running around
playing 3D Mark guys so I'm loading up
the same Benchmark on both phones
[Music]
go oh the crowd is going
wild wow that looks fun that like that
kind of looks fun just play with look at
that 230 frames per second oh my
goodness me iPhone 15 Pro Max Ultra it
just works 3,7 funny how they did this
right in front of an Apple Store 67
that's the score of the iPhone
38,5 59 10 times faster 10
times 10 times okay so that's all well
and good but let's see what we can do
with that power what's the max setting
we can put it on right while we wait for
that to load just so you know by the way
I have no way of exactly measuring it
but this iPhone weighs between 150 and
200 kog in part thanks to real brushed
aluminium all the way around hence the
St which to support something that heavy
also weighs another 100 kilograms so so
this is at least don't drop this thing
on your face in bet but also I cannot
state to you just how much work has gone
into moving this thing around like I had
to call every available person I knew to
spend 3 hours just getting it into our
house and then a full-on professional
crew of six massive dudes to help get it
out again to go to London every time you
change orientation trying to put that in
your pocket
stall something like this overnight how
do you get it onto a pavement you have
to think of everything and the immense
weight of the thing is also why some
here wow this is insane kind
of you got it you got it wow okay you're
high and as you can see it's running
like Android what N9 maybe so you notice
the volume icons
do okay this is the best attempt so far
apart I think is really hard
oh oh my oh my
oh and the other benefit of having a
phone the size of like two human beings
is your selfie camera can see like the
entire
Street Android I wonder why he didn't do
the hand thing to take the picture um of
course you know use a Time selfie ever
take it come on three two one yeah see
they someone like touch the button for I
don't know why they didn't put their
hand up hey nice let's have a look what
some light social media looks like
[Music]
like ah friction burnt I've actually
burnt my finger he's the first person to
injure himself watching a Tik Tok not
doing a Tik Tok millions of people
probably killed themselves you know
doing Tik toks there's a okay yeah I
wasn't kidding this is what my finger
looked like the next day genuinely
though if you were going to endlessly
brow when you could just put that in the
street you know put on some like dummy
Tik Tok account lock it down and just
have people go maybe this would be like
Play of the future you know get your
exercise in watch whatever this
is social media this is a healthier way
of doing it you're standing you're
moving it's
interactive a bit of friction introduces
a bit of
friction now for your favorite bit this
guy's a massive speaker head and so when
it came to the speakers on this phone he
has basically you probably put your
whole fist in there maybe your entire
phone I mean look how big the holes of
the speakers are upon himself to build a
custom one of kind set of speakers for
this yeah these things operate up to
around three watts of max power this has
50
watts per speaker unit there are eight
units in total including four subwoofer
drivers purely for
base there go look at that you probably
that's
insane specific engineering decision
yeah oh notice the buttons feels like an
obvious thing to say given the scale of
them but it's actually thanks to a very
specific engineering decision yeah
behind each button is a Pneumatic
cylinder these limit the speed at which
the buttons can operate giving them a
sense of scale or in other words cunk
yeah and that's pretty satisfying but
the key thing we wanted to test here is
speakers so let's see what a video they
put them on both tab in front because of
course you know I don't even know if you
can make calls on here like phone calls
but so they have actually top and bottom
firing speakers instead of top and
earpiece speaker in tandem all looks
like on our phone um so the idea is
we're currently calling you on a normal
iPhone 15 Pro I'm going to step back
we're just going to see how far away
this call starts to become a problem
okay so this is probably two me Im
talking Tech tips and MKBHD
congratulations on your Championship
congratulations to Team USA for winning
the World um but imagine talking to him
in like the same video week it's about
the point where it disintegrates this is
the point where your foot starts to look
like it's about this long why why do I
have big feet just the Distortion at the
edge of the leg oh the okay so at about
this distance your fa that's weird but I
mean who facetimes from like
9t is starting to become dots to me um I
mean can you even hear me I'm starting
to make out about 85% of the words
you're giving me it's your noise mention
the video that he did where he was
um pointing speakers at people and only
they could hear is what's you and what's
Noise Okay that's actually spot on the
feedback we wanted did you say you use a
Galaxy Note 9 as your phone yeah it's um
it's in great condition it's kind of
funny that means technically I have a
better phone that need
us this has got to be this is some sort
of joke there's got to be a reason
Beyond that's the phone you like oh
there's a new pack it this morning I
dropped off the side of my bed
it's art he's doing an art thing it's
got to be I just really hate switching
phones I'm how it's not that hard you
plugg in the cable you're waiting out
besides the last time you would have
switched the phone would have been um in
2018 prob you on the biggest I now I
feel Paul for the first time in my life
using Discord instead of you know
iMessage guys look at look at the
channels we have here we don't
know like does it like work work it it
works trusted yeah it's literally a
giant phone screen blown up so what
about here I assume you can still see us
I mean yeah sure you guys so what
about here this phone can actually dual
boot into windows so it's actually
running Windows right here which makes
sense I mean you wouldn't want to waste
all that power
on you
know incredible undertaking yes it has
infinitely better viewing angles like
the only reason you can actually see the
screen from where you are is because we
use this we basically decided that if
we're building the best we need to use
used the best so we found an 8K 88 in
OLED TV from LG it looked absolutely
beautiful in person so we covered our
eyes we click
$24,000 actually $25,000 plus shipping
and handling at think that come you
should have gotten like a free TV
operator a purchase button because this
screen alone retails for
$25,000 and since it doesn't actually
exist as a touch screen we had to turn
it into one and that that was a pain in
the bum Yeah we actually broke one of
these TVs during this they paid
$50,000 unless they had a warranty but I
don't think warranty covers you know
turning your TV into a
phone in this process it's just so
difficult because what we have to do is
optically laminate a touch layer onto
the TV and it's necessary to use some
highly specialized Optical glue for this
so that it retains going to use that
method you know how you can turn a Mac
into a touch screen where they just use
like waves that project upward and you
can turn it into a touch the OLED image
quality yeah and the optical glue was
only available in like 50 ml bottles
yeah we basically bought the UK's entire
supply of this glue there you cannot buy
it right now because we bought them out
so sorry phone repair people the first
TV also Noti how Google meet
is the
icon broke because of this glue it's
extremely runny and there was a tiny Gap
all the way around the TV which it
flowed into and onto some circuitry
completely destroying it we got a 6 a.m.
distress call from that I think he
broken down basically things were not
going to plan it was literally the worst
thing that could have possibly happened
but we've got through it we've got a
perfectly working one now right cic
3840 wat hour
batteries yeah I think it's pretty safe
to say that yeah yeah yeah cool yeah
yeah so do you want to see the giant
iPhones are you going to Blind Me
Maybe all right three torch is actually
directional so it can point 2
[Music]
1 like this the
light she really whoa all right so now
guys the the adjudicator is coming here
the touchscreen navigation the
touchscreen keyboard all these usual
functions that you typically see with
your average smartphone okay I wonder if
it has data cap capability okay the
record is determined by the length of
this item but I also need to confirm
that it is a scaled version of the
actual dimensions of an iPhone believe
he already getting I wonder if that's
true if it is cuz you know that TV TVs
AR probably aren't like scaled up
smartphones it's not like you cut it out
so you know the dynamic what they call D
Dynamic continent isn't
um it doesn't actually have a camera
into work on confirming that it is 15
times scaled up version of the original
I'm getting really nervous she keeps
talking about ratios I didn't quite
expect just how seriously these guys
take their measurements it has to be
spoton I'm scared it has work it has to
work hey thanks for coming I know he's a
baby compared to him two no just two
million subscribers which means he is
basically 10 times bigger than her but
they probably get the same opportunities
as other like mean she can travel whever
she wants she can get you know whatever
phones from Samsung she
wants and
hey social media is very large your
memes are 8K this a oh my God this is
crazy what okay Showtime let's start
with the exterior buttons so this is the
lock button so as it would be on an
iPhone that locks it Brant they require
power but that's for a reason to make
them feel giant see what you're doing
there is changing the volume and that
top button is an action button so the
latest iPhones allow you to configure it
to do one action you want like turn the
latest iPhones could do more than that I
mean the action button should be used
more I mean it should have at least
three functions like push down tap
double tap I mean I I have like two
actions designed to volume buttons and
two of times my side keying on the
flashlight which is what we've done so
that is our flashlight which is a 400
watt torch basically looking good we're
off to a good start let's look at some
touchscreen
navigation for example let's tap that
this is our page I know it looks like
I'm holding it together at this point
but I was breaking you see toks again
right there it's I wonder if that's
something behind the scenes but it's
really funny seeing toks on my iPhone I
was so scared that in the moment
something she wanted to see would just
not work and that would be it well this
record of course it must be based on a
commercially available phone it is a
brilliant scaled up version the
demonstration everything you've just
shown me is gone kind of reminds me of
an iPad Mini honestly very smoothly so I
can confirm that what you have achieved
today is in fact
a new Guinness World Record oh
my did it thank
you the excitement is Justified you have
achieved the largest smartphone replica
at
2.54 m is very impressive very slick
made to a high standard so it gives me
great pleasure to present you with this
official certificate congratulations
you're officially amazing
congratulations to Mr H boss for making
the world's largest
smartphone all right next on our list
there's this new internet Trend I don't
know how new it is but we've recently
heard about it and um Let me let me pull
up see exactly what it's called and I
found a Wiki how article um on it so
here it is it's
called oh gotta thick this up it's
called wait was is it hot girl suu
whatever that is so I did a research to
figure out what what that was and you
type that in and you get some of the
dumbest um results of um all time so I'm
going to uh let's see if we can pull
this up on the
screen um side note here you can
actually use a special I think it's
called kiwix kiwix browser to um
download some Wiki how and Wikipedia
pages on a mobile device uh so that is
great as well for offline use so here
here it is on wikihow.com this is
actually applicable um
online I think you can download this
article online and it was last updated
July 10th 2024 so I guess technically
it's still summer so it's still in there
I've okay
ready it says it's a phrase that en ENC
encourages
people sorry to embrace confidence
during the summer
months which I mean you've kind of
excluded half the population here I mean
what about boys but this is people what
whatever it says
um these sentences really don't make
sense honestly they don't Melanie seems
so confident and carefree lately she's
definitely in a hot girl summer
era that makes zero sense at all I mean
literally none But continuing on it says
the phrase comes from a song from Megan
the
stallion who was apparently from Houston
I think I'm not sure that could be
someone else um it says the big part is
being exactly who you are so according
to this hgs as it's acronymed is um it
basically means that if you're feeling
lazy be lazy if you want to change your
hair color change your hair color if you
want
to to dress in clothes that aren't
stylish do that so apparently that means
that um just just um just being lazy and
and doing nothing is this a really
really long Trend in the long line of
trends of H of uh uh Instagram and Tik
Tock trends of doing nothing and just
being yourself it's a really long and
convoluted way of saying that all right
but but no there's still more there's
still more it says to have fun get out
and do things that you love and make the
most out of everything unless feeling
lazy then you know just sit around and
do nothing all right and then it says
Embrace confidence Megan the stallion um
confidently Embraces a range of personas
and
appearances huh so she's has multiple
personalities so apparently having
multiple personalities doing nothing or
being yourself um is what this term
means but apparently it only applies to
Summer
and it also applies to other people too
so like not girls so men so you know I I
I I think I'm going to rank oh wait no
still there still more be kind oh okay
that's great um don't let being single
get you down um okay yeah okay so uh
we're done here um apparently is this
term is just just waste of wo but you
know we got to talk about that on the
list all right speaking of um oh wait
got that on there um we get that all
right speaking of that AA Harper
um it is doing okay over on Instagram
but um I've realized this one thing that
the the Trends on Instagram um are
almost uncompetitive not because um they
they're good or they take time and work
and effort no because the artificial
intelligence technology simply
doesn't isn't um there
yet um to compete with these mindless uh
trends that I have to compete with so
you know instead of and of course you
know it's even harder and next week
we'll talk about how to um get the most
out of photo leap of these for AI
influencers where you can change their
clothes um so let's say she's wearing a
jacket maybe can put on like a different
shirt or something so so we will get the
same parameters using the same account
for free um but here we here we have a
trend trend from very popular people so
I've heard or researched um hopefully
you guys can see this on the screen um
when it comes up I have to find to save
things yeah I saved them as
bookmarks um here we
go these are these these have gotten
thousands of views and hearts and
likes let's see what we have
here okay this is from a popular person
apparently named Brooke
monk let's see if I can pull this up on
the screen all here we
go
so I don't think the sound matters let
me reload um so we can see the the full
essence of this important important
Trend that's garnered
I don't know yes over
200,000 likes
200,000 here we go
reload there
go yes people a 3 second video of
of of whatever that
is um got
200 it is near impossible for me to even
prompt that like if if like video
generation technology cost a lot of
money but even if I wanted to prompt
that what would I prompt that as like
just just
just what okay and then there's other
stuff too it's even worse I mean at
least this
has
talent I wouldn't really call that
Talent I call
that whatever but but I mean there some
people just stand there I get do not
okay I I've done this in research
unfortunately we can't really do it yet
and it just like they stand like pretend
I'm standing and they just go like f
like just just like jumping but like
really short like I don't know if their
feet um lift off the ground or something
how is that what are you doing
I don't really get and also how am I
supposed to prompt that again it's it's
new new new impossible so I mean that
that's who that's that's who in
competition with people so um be sure to
like And subscribe all right we've eclip
an hour of podcasting time so now we got
to talk about Samsung one UI and um I
wish Samsung with one UI 6.1.1 and seven
would vastly improve the battery life on
their devices hopefully it gets a lot
better um it I am at 12 hours not of
screen on time but it's on time which
means
realistically uh oh I'm running out of
battery realistically it would not do
well
um it wouldn't last from say 6 to um 18
o'clock or 6 from 6 to 6 so it wouldn't
last even a full day
um also Samsung Galaxy um oneui 6.1
though is going to
bring um artificial intelligence updates
um not on device though um just regular
like in in the cloud
um whole host of updates to including
drawing to an image which I'm really
exciting excited for um I'm really
excited to draw to an image on Samsung
devices it's also going to bring um
actually let's go to the Samsung
Newsroom post and on it says that two
days so on
Monday um so I guess just in time of
Sunday Night Football U Monday Night
Football
um the update will release um to the
United States on the Galaxy s24 series
on the n9th at least in beta and it is
releasing on in in
Korea
um today I think so if there any Korean
listeners
um hello and
also guys go get your update um actually
might be the eth over there now so they
might already have the update but um
here's all the features that Samsung's
going to bring and I'm really excited to
see hopefully it fixes the battery and
hopefully R your i7 fixes this one major
problem with Samsung um devices so it
says that you're going to have the Inu
which is I think it's already on some
devices and Shad assist and composer so
I'm really excited to see that it's
getting rolled out better the Samsung
keyboard needs to get better haptic wise
hopefully they fix that um suggested
replies will also be on here I I like to
see how different is compared to regular
um suggested replies um versus the AI
version and um note assist um the circle
to search which has the generating sound
results um which is actually on devices
right now so let's talk about that um
yeah oh it came out September 5th in
sept KN so let's talk about Circle to
search I tested it out with some song
files on my phone um and I'm actually
going to show it off again so we have
the Galaxy s24 Ultra here Circle the
search to music actually you can now
finally search for songs that are
playing on device um so I'm really glad
for that so this is how you use S sups
music so we have a bevy of songs on here
first we have um Take Me Out to the Ball
Game
which I use for sound effect or
something so first you have to play the
song I hope you guys can hear this let
me play
go and then you hold down Circle you
click the oh no you don't actually
Circle sorry you hold down and then you
click the music
button and it pulls it up pause and it
pulls up the correct song and the
correct singer so it's one for one right
there but then we'll go to the next song
next song Here is in the wild the you
know the VBS theme song in the
wild you hold it down again colnect the
music
button and two for two so it's done a
really great job on those songs again
and I think we have my country t on here
technically it's correct um at least
when I tested it again
and it pulls it up as the UK National Em
which is technically correct because
it's the same tune but no there are no
words in it so we'll give it that one
but it does does shockingly mess up um
some songs here so um of course it
doesn't know any of the kid Corner songs
that yeah the um but I think there was
one song it messed
up I don't think it knew the nasal am
over the United States let's test it
out all right uh no not that
one no that s
edited all right now let's go back no
sorry and then you
played and then let me see if it worked
oh it didn't know that one all right so
it's 4 for four so it either got fixed
um on since last time I tested it but it
does really great job on the song
selections I tested it on I don't have
any music apps on here like Spotify I
think there's YouTube music but of
course we probably can't play it on
stream but four for four there oh I
think it was like four for five or four
for six last time I tested it out so it
also knows some of those free songs too
like um an Epic Journey I think it knows
Over the Horizon so Sam did a really
good job there um actually that's Google
but did a great job um there as well so
what's next on our list here um Samsung
s25 Ultra um is coming out soon but
here's the one problem that I wish
Samsung would fix on the devices and as
you can see here there is no multi-user
support on Samsung um
devices okay you have secure folder but
there's no multi-user support and I
would definitely switch to pixel if they
had a device that had a screen dis size
pixel9 Pro XL as stylist and Dex like
capabilities because there's another way
you can get secure fold the like stuff
of course I miss Bixby but I really
would like to have multi-user
capabilities on here you know just hand
the phone to someone for maybe like a
few days you can switch it also be good
for security I hope that Android
introduces at least an Android 15 or 16
a distress password so like a password
that you can give the like I heard about
someone who like a gun pointed to their
head uh like distress passw where that
pop with fake data the armad phone does
that um and I hope for distress password
on um Android devices as well but until
then I think you might might be need
some workarounds where you can switch to
like a guest mode or something like that
or even a guest mode if you just want to
do a web search without having to unlock
your phone um I really hope Samsung
brings that in it was in oneui 5.1
something but then they took it away
because I thought it was Bucky it's on
Samsung tablet so I really hope Samsung
you know brings it back um it's a really
nice feature and every Android device
everyone has it it's the one thing I
haven't been able to emulate on um
Samsung devices so it's copying apple
and that's not a good thing um speaking
of apple apple is confirmed for a new
event called glow up I
think
um
and the iPhone se4 May probably won't be
released but the iPhone sc4 does look
pretty decent and I expect it become a
pretty good um seller um at least among
Jin ZZ um yeah it's glow time that's
what it's called um I think jingi might
actually miss the wide angle camera
though um I've seen so many pictures of
kids you know taking their phones and
going
like at like0 five at Point 6 or
whatever going and you see like their
tongue and their nose and then they post
it on Instagram thinking that it's a
good picture um news flash it probably
isn't all right um here's the here's the
news report from Mac world all it's glow
time here is their logo this kind of
gives off Siri sires
looks it says the iPhone 16 16 plus
would look nearly identical to the 15
and 15 plus with no new capabilities to
look for but I don't know what he's
talking about this is not what the
iPhone 15 and 15 plus look like I don't
I don't know why they're going back
to going back to um horizontal all the
way back to iPhone 11 iPhone 12 days
because the iPhone 13 they told us that
the camera because of its diagonal
placement was actually better because
you could fit more stuff into or
something like it was like 28% larger or
something like that so I don't know why
they're going back um it reminds me kind
of of like Samsung kind of reminds me of
the Asus zenone
9 let's see if pulled up on the
screen
um yeah here we go as you can see on the
screen this is the Asus Zen phone 9 look
at like that little camera bumps right
there maybe have like some little
OnePlus phone kind of reminds me of
something from
like a few years ago like pre-2020
um it has an action button it might have
a capture button which is nice that're
adding more buttons to phones I hope
Samsung copies this trend as well I want
to see more buttons come back
um onto phones and they might add o oh
OLS of course all across but they might
bring that over to the SE um 4 as well
um and of course I have a 48 megapixel
camera and probably start at 256
gigabytes of storage I'd like to see
what kind of new artificial intelligence
capabilities they bring to the
device that would be nice to see um of
course Samsung is also releasing an s25
ultra um
and I hope it's a great device um I
probably won't get it but this is what
people think M may look like and it has
curved no curved edges so sad about that
but I mean look how thin the bezels are
and look at how the corners are rounded
off instead of like flat and I actually
like that design choice I like rounded
Corners because it's like digging into
your hand though it would be kind of sad
to lose the ULU design though I do like
how thin the bzel are as well I'm glad
that we'll have an s pin though I heard
that the note might be coming back as
well so I'm really glad about that
hopefully they'll put SD card slots on
there as well um but this is a very
pretty phone right there um I also think
that it's going to have a 6.9 in display
and I'm sad about this only 5,000
milliamp battery a bigger display
um Samsung should do better I I hope for
maybe at least a 6,000 M battery on
Ultra maybe maybe maybe next year next
year in the next two years because if I
had extra 1,000 mli hours on here let's
see five
so let's see 12 I get I'm getting 12
hours on 5,000 milliamp hours which
means I'm getting about two and a half
extra hours um per milliamp hour um
according to math so I might get a 14
hour battery 14 and a half hour instead
of 12:30
that's still not good but maybe the chip
will be more efficient on the s25
ultra so
it's it it's better um hope I I wish
they would um do better so hopefully
Samsung can innovate um better as well
so let's see what's next on our list
here yeah we talk about Snapchat scam
all right SS
ltw
um of speaking of that fake ad that we
ran of the fake phone
um is we used the same technology from
11 labs to create the fake um voice um
behind the again so guys make sure you
guys check out our newest series but
right now we're detailing oh wait you
can't see this on the screen can you no
you
cannot right now we're detailing um
uh elections um and and how they changed
throughout November um well actually
election in September but like how
student council works and there are
plenty plenty of jokes in here that we
can get into next time and this is going
back to um 2022 early 2023 as well so
guys make sure you check that out all
right
um really nice pin by the way um what
else do we have here all right well Mr
mobile just released a video um so we're
going to go through
that let's check let's check the backup
over here see how well it's
doing where are we at 34% oh yeah we're
gonna be done before the backup
end all right so Mr mobile released a
new video about the Google pixel series
I want to see what he did um I think
it's about the pixel 9 Pro yeah the
pixel 9
fold wait I gotta repair the headphones
because I don't want sound to leak over
into the stream all right oh and of
course we got to do our transcript
search so we can leap out all the bad
words cuz I do not feel like editing
today right copy
here
and and while I'm pairing the earphones
what do you guys think about the Google
pixel 9 Pro and Google pixel 9 pro4
Google pixel 99 Pro
XL pause
f um can you see this on the screen no
you cannot all right there you go and
hope you can also hear this on the
screen because it' be really sad if you
couldn't I'm actually going to check
that on my phone um wait no I can
actually check on the stream here that's
one of the benefits of actually having
nice Ram um using Chrome and other
browsers is not
slow um 32 gigabytes of RAM so I don't
know what what what should I do with
that um of course you know some water
applications of course I so me oh nice
the they have chapters and timeline and
chat replay all easy in here okay oh
oops oops we went full screen right
there we go
all right looks good all right so hope
you guys can see and hear this on the
screen let me just
check and we'll react a lot more to this
as well
wait wait wait wait I don't know can you
guys still
hear no you cannot okay so let me let me
catch up to live make sure you okay let
me catch up to
live and cut the feed let go back again
stop
screen
present all right here we go all right I
think we should be back online has ever
made and one of the biggest generation
to generation upgrades the smartphone
world has ever seen so why aren't I more
excited by it all great I well because
it still compromises in two of the
biggest categories that have kept
foldables Out Of Reach of creators and
normals along
[Music]
what do you guys think about this design
it's obviously not the most aesthetic
but you know who who do you guys spend
time looking at the backs of your
[Music]
phones I covered the major differences
with last year's pixel fold in my hands
off also guys what do you think bezels
or whole hunt on video so I won't dwell
on those except to say that I'm still
sad Google ditched the passport like
form factor I get it it introduced more
problems than solved but I still think
there's fertile ground worth exploring
in that space between book type and flip
type foldables I really hope this
intermediate category clam books flip
shells whatever doesn't go away
forever uh I think it probably will
unfortunately that said I guess there's
nothing wrong with conforming if you're
still competing and the 9 Pro fold
competes it's substantially thinner than
Sams fold 6 which makes its added
display acreage even more impressive
despite its higher mass now 8 in what do
you guys think about the galaxy book the
Galaxy F
Ultra screens are nothing new in this
category globally but this is the first
time we've had such a luxurious canvas
here in the states and I'm delighted to
report that Google's promises about
brightness were not overstated all right
wait especially you have the screen that
big you know can actually use it um for
navigation CU you know getting lost is
not fun the snappy Hench that folds
completely flat without a fight about
the only thing I wish Google had done on
the hardware is find a way to further
minimize the crease but just like on all
modern foldables it doesn't diminish the
experience of actually you know using
the thing how much utility you get from
that screen will vary I had a great
debate about this with my friends on the
Android police podcast with Will selberg
making the point that not enough Android
apps are optimized for big screens to
make big foldables worth it for him but
I mean there's it's nice for um you
know uh reading articles websites I like
doing that a lot I'm actually going to
show you a trick that I use in Google
after this my point is you got to take
stock of the things you do on your phone
most often for me that's reading
articles on substack or medium same
exactly exactly I'm trying to read you
know more stuff on substack and medium
the problem with substack is that the
discovery isn't good so you have to
actually go out and find new articles
and on medium they are most of the
people
are most of the people are switching
to more paid articles and not paying for
Medan skimming blogs and chrome soaking
up reviewers guide PDFs from Gmail
reading books and Kindle documenting my
so-called life and note moving money
around in banking apps watching YouTube
and tracking the nitty-gritty of kitty
blood cell counts in spread sheets
spread spreadsheets actually look did he
blew something he might have blew
something spreadsheets actually look
nice on uh foldables in my
opinion and for every one of these use
cases which again are actual examples of
how I use my phone every day friends
that big screen is an order of magnitude
more useful than than your typical tall
rectangle and we haven't even gotten to
the photography
benefits do I run into apps that don't
scale well to the nearly Square screen
absolutely often it looks
great in those cases the standard siiz
cover display is just a flip away well
actually you forgot about that cover
display it's those concrete conveniences
to which I gravitate far more more
readily than the AI features a sentiment
that also carries over to the cameras I
like AI but I'm expecting the anti aai
business is going to Boom uh
soon yeah okay I gotta down just
download DCI resolve now this is a tough
discussion because two different things
are true at once here first this is an
outstanding camera system that almost no
normal person will have any problem with
but second it's also the most
compromised part of a phone so expensive
that it should really carry no
compromise when I asked Google's
director of design why the telephoto and
ultrawide cameras are diminished
versions of what you get on the pixel9
pro his explanation was that there
wasn't room in the casing to use those
self-same sensors and they wanted to fit
a bigger battery with the reclaimed
space the thing is this is still a
massive camera module yeah exactly also
this is like only like half a phone's
thickness I I think Google's Engineers
could you know do better and the
batteries same to Samsung too stay
tuned again for most people this
downgrade will make no difference in the
day-to-day the two generation leap and
processor also I like to see how Windows
launchers would work on folding devices
as well I've tried some windows
launchers but you know Touch first and
this is we're actually going to get into
that soon Touch first ecosystems um just
make Windows themed la is really hard
but for a big screen I mean there are
tablets that were smaller than this I
had a 11.1 in tablet you know um oh I
said big screen and BX thought I was
talking to it be quiet
um yeah so 11.1 8 in that's not too big
of a thing and of course you know the
iPad Mini is 8 inchor versus the pixel
fold really makes a difference despite
the similar Optics just look at these
Zoom shots of one World Trade to see how
much more detail you get from 9 Pro F
right let's see this is N9 Pro fold
versus oh this is the fold versus The
Fold let's
see yeah that is a lot more detail right
there and no this is not using the AI
Zoom enhance which uh I have not found
used wow that
is Liberty right
there and coming back to street level it
turns out the dog days of autumn are the
perfect time of year to test a camera
like this the traditional strength of
the pixel has been shoot from the hip
reliability and whether it's the muggy
morosity of the sweat soaked Mr moraband
on one of his Brooklyn thought walks or
an improbably idyllic day watching a
brass band play pop covers in Bryant
Park or the quick and dirty snapshots
from opening week at the most perfectly
named new Cafe in Brooklyn yes David
kogan really opened a coffee shop and
yes he really did call it coffee
check oh I went I wonder if you can pay
by checks over there or the main camera
selfies and tabletop mode time lapses
only a foldable can give you this is an
outrageously good wow that's a nice that
a really good time lapse right there
camera and yet I just can't help
thinking of what might have been with
the truth that looks janky who who whoa
top of the line Optics you get on the
non-folding version of this phone which
to belabor the point costs about $800
less and look okay I think that's my
that's my internet connection there's no
way that the phone is that junky let me
put this in context I'm coming freshly
off a review of a xiaomi phone with some
delectable Leica film emulation filters
that I liked a lot and so I find I don't
enjoy Google's color processing the way
I once did with its annoying tendency to
cool everything down I'm pretty sure you
can download like a filter pack I mean
let's
see or of course you know I'm pretty
sure you could Sil load the like
a like a camera app for phones let
see my friend hay hughman says it has a
sterile quality to it I think that's a
great word and it doesn't help that some
old problems remain here like the slow
lens switching during zooms and the hair
trigger orientation sensor when the
phone is
open but as long as I'm nitpicking about
the small stuff I've got to give crap
that is pretty good quality here I'd
like to see what the can do with this
his hair but that is really good quality
of course he's probably using the back
cameras as the front C on the small
stuff too I am always listening to
podcasts or songs out and about and I'm
frequently recording video out and about
the pixel is the only phone I've used
that doesn't make me stop what I'm
listening to in order to record those
video
clips that's actually useful I mean you
can probably transcribe like what
someone's saying into your ear into a
video that's a good feature and I'm glad
that he went like in depth about that it
also doesn't reset my framing when I
switch between photo and video modes
take notes
Samsung let's conclude the camera convo
with AI sure I had fun asking the pixel
to reimagine greenpoint's Pencil Factory
as though it were really made of pencils
and that's really useful and
yeah that looks actually that actually
looks believable wow indulging my maob
side by putting a pothole in the
foreground spitting steaming blood later
I tried correcting this algae choked
pond in Prospect Park by replacing it
with Crystal Clear Water that's great
that's really great though I mean I
don't know what happened to this bench
here in the shore looks a bit off sort
of and this photo of horses in the same
Parks Paddock is what my mind wanted to
be there given that fence type and the
time of day and some childhood
memories but I think Captain Scott says
it best but it's not real it's just a
computer generated fantasy and I'm just
an old man who's trying to hide in
it at the end of the day I just rather
use the existing pixel features which
thankfully are still included to put an
artistic spin on things that are real as
opposed to using AI to insert things
that never were
I touched on battery life earlier six
hours of school that's insane I mean
it's not insane but compared to my phone
it's it's
better look it's not a disaster but it's
also not one of the high points I've hit
the low battery warning before bedtime
on nearly every day of my week-long test
period also annoying the placement of
the charging coil means your existing
wireless chargers may or may not work
it only charges at 7.5 watts and reverse
wireless charging is also absent that's
not
great what is great phone calling and in
comparison with Motorola's Razer plus
the aforementioned David kogan preferred
the way I sounded on the pixel and I
found that's nice it probably makes
sense um it's bigger so maybe the
speakers like longer so maybe you can
Stu more now instead of into the phone
his voice on Google's phone too that new
clear calling feature is pulling its
weight I guess I like to see a test of
clear calling versus Samsung voice
isolation no I will never use those
audio emojis but they're here if you
want them part of the
port I actually want to see I wonder if
that means you can finally
um I if that can means you can finally
play a recording on a phone
call like without having to buy those
computerized systems like I wonder if
can like go deep inside and change their
recording um of the Emojis the audio
emojis to whatever they want interesting
feature
there the portfolio of pixel features
I've now enumerated enough times over
the years to just skip them on this go
around I find those value ads so
compelling that I'll probably stay on
the pixel 9 Pro full rather than revert
to the OnePlus open because even though
I prefer that phone's Hasselblad camera
and open canvas multitasking I value
Google's eye for design and the priority
it's placed on useful features the same
reasons would probably prompt me to pick
the pixel over Galaxy fold 6 not to
mention Google's Superior Zoom
performance but there are compelling
reasons to choose any of these the fold
6 is more Compact and more mature with a
stronger set of foldable specific
features you also get deck like features
while the OnePlus open can likely be had
for the lowest cost
yeah it's a good time for large
foldables as they've settled into a
semblance of the same maturity their
flip type counterparts are beginning to
enjoy it is in other words the end of
the beginning and Google has done a
fantastic job of bringing its pixel in
line with the current foldable cream of
the crop I guess the reason I'm not as
enthusiastic as I expected to be is that
I think the pixel shines most brightly
when it's a Trailblazer setting the tone
with either features or prices and as
solid as it is the pixel 9 Pro fold does
neither so it just feels like more
follower than
leader if you decide a pony up for got
to talk about this new website that's
that's out um actually's two of them so
one of them is the Monica artificial
intelligence check but so I'm going to
open up a new tab here so you can pull
it up on the screen and then the next
one is a dedicated website so wa let me
get to the stream
here I hope you guys can see the tab on
the screen let's go to Monica over
here all right you guys can see um and
it should
be around here
somewhere oh
wow let me just type in samung or
whatever
maybe it didn't transfer over onto the
new computer well there is oh here it is
here it
is so I have to log in so while I'm
logging into Monica um this thing is
going to roast um accounts that you own
um and I actually think that does a
pretty good job of it so as I'm signing
in
come on come
on I have to talk to you about this
feature they have on Google um it's in
most search engines too but it allows
you to search by date and I I'll talk
talk to you about this about while we're
signing in you to talk to search by date
on um on on things so let's just go here
and let go type in
crackberry in this article we'll show
you why touch Centric is very important
so as you can see here we have Windows
mobile articles from like the past 10
from from like the past decade but if
you search and go back to custom Ru and
then you click it and go to to 2007 you
can see what people were talking about
smartphones before the original iPhone
came out or when the original iPhone
came out and I was reading this article
I like to read like these blogs for fun
it was really fun about what he was
saying with about the
um this Windows mobile phone as a
Blackberry user and what people were
using them for so this is just him
switching and I'm going to go find the
most important quotes here um it
actually restarted like Windows when
pocket PC had a
stylus
um it had three input devices uh touch
stylus and trackpad
and I actually could have lost data if
you don't save it before the power went
off so that is that's not a good thing
he was confused he said it felt like a
smartphone like like a computer compared
to his BlackBerry um I do like that it
had Microsoft Office mobile and media
player to the device so that's great um
it also found the uh found it to be kind
of slow so I like to see what it felt
like he said compared to a
Communications tool it wasn't good but
compared to computer it was better but
this is what I was thinking about here
like down when you downsize your OS to
something that's Touch first hand first
you have to do what did want Android iOS
but if you want to run like a Windows
Launcher it it's not as good but I like
to see how it how well it does on say a
Samsung gxy fold or
s or
z a pixel
right we're signing oh Monica opened it
up as its own app that's why I couldn't
find it all right there we
go okay so hopefully you guys can now
see this on the screen we're going to go
to
Google and we have the home
button it's still not loading so let's
go back let's go back to um our
crackberry article and crackberry is a
really interesting
website oh here we go so hope you guys
can see the Monica interface coming up
on the screen can you see it let me go
back and check yes you can all right so
it has
a roast me feature let me let me get
away from that
let me find its tool
kit oh wow it can convert
tools okay let's see if I can can you
roast me I know had a roast me feature
built in
here huh it's gone now but here's the
second roast me feature um
let me pull it
up the site is called burnt Tweeter I
think let me check make sure it's the
right one
let me check to see if it's mine
I found a new one and this is honestly
hilarious so um hope you guys can see
this on the screen and I'll show the
original one from another site that I
found
um all right you can see this it says uh
the tech boy or the selfa Evangelical
Tech Media company with the profile that
screams I'm trying too hard true first
off congrats on trating a Twitter
profile that's exciting as a sermon as a
Baptist Church on a Sunday
morning is that supposed to be an insult
um okay whatever your bio read like a
bad infam musal script whatever okay
your tweets are a hot mess of Randomness
like a garage a garage cell of Broken
Dreams wow what a sentence right there
new laptop of 33 gabes of ram what do
are you asking for advice to just want a
flex and non-existent Tech muscles what
with the tech boy giveaway oh speaking
of we are giving away a gift card
um to people who join um NTB uh not the
boy um it's going to be random or picked
on off the best post it says I love her
your assess of live streaming and
podcasting but your long exile to NTB
sounds like a bad euphemism for a trip
to the dentist which I like dentist and
who's NTB your long lost
cousin anyway uh your tweets are so
cring it makes me wonder if you're
secretly an expert created by a middle
school science project F and find the
jokes in this
post oh dang dang and don't don't think
don't you give me start out 10 Ro do
them do you think X is hot me does this
look like a pixel8 pro that's not a joke
that's C that is a good joke okay it's
from the SSI ltw series because you know
the pixel 8 Pro had the temperature
Cent all right wow that's a great one
here here's another one um from another
company hope you guys can see the image
on the screen now nope not yet
yeah now oh the tech boy where do we
even start you seem like a welome
contradiction wrapping the tech blog he
can be the largest tech blog in houst
with only 288 follows well I I still am
the largest tech blog Houston seems like
your audience is a Luci of your
understanding of modesty true because I
did go
on yeah and uh leaving us wondering if
you're more interested in Saving souls
or a monetization check both um I don't
know what they're talking about what the
Dark Knight was or something um but it
says maybe it's time to expose my
radical obsess of how did it Tech and
moral
policing uh no oh the idea of romance is
as druming as a Windows 95 update and my
hum is as dry as a Texas something hey
you're consistent with inconsistency
very very very funny um things um right
there all right we still have 20 minutes
of podcasting time left let's see what
else we have le left to talk about
let's see if I can get Freedom GPT
offline working on here let's
see and we'll see its responses maybe
we'll put it through the same questions
that we put the last offline Artificial
Intelligence on um as you guys know
Freedom GPT is an uncensured artificial
intelligence they have a computer
version um
all
right and I'm downloading it right now
unfortunately the my
antivirus quarantined it
um so as it's
downloading only a minute left of time
let's see if we can find enough to um
let's see if we can find another another
one another most oh here it
is there's an AI for that says that
there's a Twitter roast roast um
application
uhoh and I'm getting some of the network
that we had on the last
computer oh here we go here we go hope
you guys can see this on the screen
all right and we're going
up share
again o oo o here we go here we
go oh and we downloaded
so it says I need permission to
download permission from
who oh man it canceled again
I think a vast is blocking
it I gotta turn that off but let's see
what it says about
me it's in
Spanish so um we're going to put this
into English now um
and while we're doing that um we're
going to fix the antivirus
protection oh man it's not working
whatever let's just put this
in dang here's what it says wow look who
we have here technology media Angeles
who seems to have come out of a
stereotyping machine what what's up
friend have you run out of ideas for
your sermons and now giving social
commentary I bet your podcasts are as
exciting as watching a wall painted all
right poll guys what do you guys think
these podcasts are as exciting as
watching a wall painted yes or no I
think it's more excited than watching a
wall painted but that's just me all
right um
oops and that description of yours did
you write it or did my mother write it I
wrote it it seems that you have titles
and a
textbook that's good because textbooks
are very smart all right so um hopefully
we can get Freedom GPT to start working
again
um because I do like that we have enough
RAM to run it finally
um let's see contrl J that's how you
access your downloads by the away it's
cancel right download I'm going to
retry right we're retrying the
[Music]
download and I'm going to replace this
antivirus with a vast
one it's a lot better
than this the regular avast antivirus
did my computer just die in the middle
of a
backup yep I think it just died people
so hopefully it can hopefully I can get
that
working so as I'm uninstalling the
antivirus so I can
install all right so I'm reinstalling
aast one which is a lot better antivirus
and freedom GPT is still going
on all right so as Freedom GPT is
downloading let's go back to our
crackberry article hope you guys can see
this on screen
and here's what crackberry is doing now
so they still
exist oh here's an article about the
pixel 9 Pro fold see what they have to
say for themselves by Drew Co
K all right so it says no one needs a
folding but has nice to have features
like oh it doesn't say um it is thin I
do like look look how thin that is
compared to normal pixel non fold so it
it's great it's nice and thin um it has
an official case that comes in two
pieces
um I do not want to reboot the computer
in the middle of a stream all right here
we go here's a vast oh no no no no no no
we're not installing a vest yet we're
installing Freedom GPT and it is now on
the SSD of the
computer no no no no not a asked Freedom
