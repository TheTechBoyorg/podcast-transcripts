<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 71324</h1>
<pre>and we are live hello Internet good
morning evening and afternoon everybody
yes I am live we have lots to talk about
from AA Harper the student council um
News videos too yes people read it still
crazy still crazy even if they tell them
what is right and what is wrong and to
do but we got to talk about what we were
talking about last week which is the um
thing forgot oh yeah what people do with
computers so uh you know without further
Ado and I'm just scrolling through
here all right yes I'm I found my Reddit
post also apparently yesterday was my
cake day oh wow I
got oh five 480 total views on the video
I posted that's good
um so I asked the people in Mac OS and
windows what they do other than internet
browsing and got toal of 15,000 views
with nine total shares all right so
um let's get to
work where is my
site I will now share this on
screen so let's let's get into what
people do here all right so who's what
people do on Windows other than browsing
um I watch groundhogs uh using a
photography editing um um and they
manage other windows devices and I have
to say to that like okay you manage
stuff but what are the other devices
doing probably browsing I don't know and
then some astr photography stuff and
that's me also I really want photoshop
on my phone I gotta talk about that soon
okay um whatever whatever um writing
drawing gaming reading document creation
and editing multimedia and little
programming which is nice and aside from
the gaming I mean you can do that on a
Chromebook or a phone plug it into a
virtual monitor all right let's keep
going in here I program play games
called frch also call friends internet
okay whatever play games whatever in
program what are you guys program I
don't know I draw windows on the cursor
on the desktop
oh I gotta respond to this I believe
in responding to every comment that I
can all right what else do these people
do um already do on Windows while I have
a job it involves managing a fleet of
Windows PCS dedicated to cad see cad is
something that people probably need to
use Windows 4 or Mac OS you know actual
desktop operating system after they and
say Android or Chrome OS um development
with Visual Studio gaming and calling
friends that you don't have so
apparently he talks to AIS by himself
speaking of chat GPT now has voice
integration
technology here gaming encoding work
Community owner fors and Gamers and I
also found out that someone still runs a
BBS that's still accessible via dialup I
did try to use Windows dialer and
ethernet cable and some virtual modem
software to connect to it unfortunately
it did not work all right
um and then I ask people on Windows and
Mac that Mac is more creative uh then I
ask people on Windows what do you use
computers for that you don't use phones
for got 112 comments and zero up votes
apparently I don't don't like me um they
say
that they use text software and
documents uh software and documents some
people didn't like the terminology of
apps prefer to use programs they said
that the chips and phones are
throttled um which is true then they use
code editors in bigger screens and I
said doesn't Android have a code editor
and Screen negated due to Dex reasons
and they said that uh code doesn't have
a good ide U
installed all right they also said they
like having three screens which Dex
doesn't allow um
they have 3D uh rendering off a phone on
a phone on on desktops and Samsung de
according this phones are limited
Android is not software limited there
isn't as many development tools no
virtual missing capabilities on Android
phones yet in factors VM shut down but
it was good for
nothing people and wi ler isn't still
supported on the newest latest devices
and then they say gaming um and they
also say they like to use servers and
all these types of things and this
really brings me back to the point of
like what are people doing on these
Network computers you always hear about
these hacks in networks and stuff and
it's like what are you guys doing on the
network like you apparently have like
files hosted on the network and people
just traversing to network and accessing
computers and stuff but like what what
are you guys doing on the network you
always about these Network hacks you
don't really know what they're doing
with them all right
um also Juan bnell said that um web apps
also use a lot of Ram so that that's
good makes me feel better about you know
having lots of RAM on my computer as
well speaking of computers and phones
the uh nothing and Galaxy launched new
phones nothing under the sub brand cmf
colors material and finish launched a
modular 2 $200 budget device and Samsung
launched a new fold flip Galaxy ring and
Galaxy
uh Watch series and their earbuds and
here's how I felt about each of them got
to fold it looks the same except it has
a good looking cover screen I haven't
seen person so fine the Galaxy flip is
now getting seven years of software
updates and a 50 megapixel camera that's
nice but I would have to have a
telephoto zoom camera on it's A1 th000
phone it should have telephoto Ono um
and not just the 50 megapixel assistant
Zoom all right and now to the watch
Regular is fine but the ultra it's a
square and a circle no it's a circle and
a square sorry why and then for the buds
I have am angry I am very angry with
Samsung about this okay I like the
ability to not have stems in here okay
it doesn't look like a stupid Apple
product okay I would rather have them be
beans or cires the only legitimate
company that I all know that that's the
cires here is Google um that does them
like this right first of all they're
less conspicuous okay imagine you're
like a girl and you're trying to like
spy you're gonna have you can't have
these like stems hanging out at you you
have the little circles and you cover
with your hair or whatever okay so the
last conspicuous second of all they
don't look like you have airpods you
don't want to be looking like your own
iPhone all right and they do have nice
lights which is fine but still why would
you do the stem I really hope that
Samsung goes back to the beans of
circular designs like Google does for
their pixel but a series because now
people will just think that you have
knock off airpods all right and now for
the Galaxy watch Ultra uh it's fine I
guess I'm glad it's cirle I just wish it
had a more distinct color like maybe
don't make it orange maybe green yellow
something like that and also no it
didn't look like to me I could be wrong
I did not see any Basel rotating Basel
because the design is a squirkle so it's
kind of hard which is annoying all right
and then for the Galaxy Z phone flip
series nothing notable there but let's
talk about nothing here nothing actually
has a very interesting phone here that
could trick up the phone market here all
right so it's $200 so it's and it
actually has features that you can't
find anywhere else and I think it's
really good take on modular phones back
in 2019 M released modular phones some
Pogo pins you know in 2018 essential did
it I think the red hydrogen one was also
uh a little bit modular but you don't
really see modular phones
any come come out anymore right that's
that's a last decade thing thing and
this really brings back
um I guess Innovation to the phone
market like the only modular thing about
my phone right now would be I guess you
could say that the PIN comes out of the
phone and while I am happy with my phone
apart from the abysmal battery
performance that could get fixed in the
latest update and actually the one 6.1.1
software is actually the most exciting
thing that I ever seen uh seen uh come
to Samsung phones in a long time and
it's also one of the most underwhelming
things I've ever seen come to Samsung in
a long time so they had this actor
Sydney Sydney Sweeney swiy whatever her
name is okay uh they took a picture and
of her and turned into a 3D cartoon
after cool cool that's nice but I mean
we've already had some of these features
on Samsung phones for a long time first
of all the Avatar she looked like some
random white girl but but like any you
take any 20 however old she is white
woman you take the picture it's going to
be the same it needs
to ad advertise and like whatever and
then the drawing features that actually
looks neat hopefully it works offline
and it also has more integration with
the chat featur so I hope they got chat
assist fixed with the keyboard hope they
also got chat assist um to work in other
uh messaging applications say Instagram
or group me or anything like that not
just texting and emails and stuff like
that also they added transcription into
Samsung Notes that's good I wish they
would uh have a non-wound way to have
transcription built into any audio that
you import onto the phone so that just
things that are taped with Samsung Notes
or audio recording feature capabilities
they also have these new AI styled
features uh sorry filters on the phone
which are neat but also we've already
had some non AI features here and that's
problem I've been seeing these Samsung
commercials right they're using the
image editing software uh AI image
editing software which is neat it has
some erasing features but it doesn't
really try doesn't really Gras the think
like I tried to replace one person with
another person in there who was behind
something AI should be able to figure
that out like unfortunately we don't
have a photo editing application like
photoshop on mobile devices yet right I
was trying to I saw this thing at an
Astros game they had a donut but had
like a baseball texture around it right
I tried all the image editing apps on my
phone and even went um line by line with
some AI applications that we get into to
try to uh figure out how to do it and it
just would not mesh well I had a
baseball and a donut I wanted the
baseball texture to be on the donut it
didn't work well right but the Galaxy AI
image editing feature does that it
didn't really get the woman I wanted
behind the podium and and also change
and switch behind the podium it needs to
be better with that also they're also
showing AI magic eration now it may be a
little bit better but Samsung already
has a locally built-in magic that
doesn't require internet and doesn't
require subscription and I feel that
Samsung is trying to push out all these
quote unquote new AI features without
promoting their great offline features
that they've had on phones for use like
they you've been able to cut out things
from images for use okay they was
showing this off on the Note 5 okay
which was a 2015 phone okay you cut
things out of pictures for years
highlight them add in some stickers um
add text on on to your images uh and
erase things for a
few for now first of all you got Google
Samsung gallery which does this for free
locally and offline right but now they
pushing these features what it's
slightly Advanced you put the name AI in
it and then it goes up to the cloud and
these SOS cost a lot of money for
Samsung to run so in 2025 so in like a
few months from now it's going to cost
money right it's going to cost me money
to pay for these features which I
probably won't pay for so I'll keep
everything probably offline from then on
but it cost them money to run these
things so they want to recoup their
things so they're not pushing out some
of the features they already have or
upgrading some of the things they
already have so like know all phones are
really powerful I don't care what the
Reddit comments to say Reddit comments
say stupid stuff all the time okay I I
can say something so simple just like
don't do this and then they'll P me for
religious stuff or reasons or anything
like that right the people Reddit or
mostly stupid okay um I don't care what
they say my phone is powerful 12 GB of
RAM and 200 512 gigabytes of storage it
should be able to run some of these AI
models offline right and but right
before we get to nothing I have an AI
model application that is offline it
just it is okay it is okay I will say
that so we got this application called
uh private AI it has a thousand
downloads in the Play Store and allows
you to download multiple models if you
pay you can get a 7 gigabyte model which
I say which is more accurate but I
didn't pay so I have the 1 Gigabyte tiny
llama 1.1 gigabyte model and a rocket 3
gigabyte model now tiny llama is bit
faster but it and then rocket but both
these models are really fast they're lot
faster than say using AMA on your phone
or that other AI app oh
uh L that AI application doesn't take
time to boot out or anything like that
however this AI experienced pretty
severe hallucinations I asked it pretty
simple question what did President Biden
do between the time of 2017 to 2019 so
he wasn't vice president I was wondering
if he was a Senator or not and I I I
wanted to get this answer offline right
it told me that he was inaugurated in
January of 2021 that is true however it
told me that he was president in 2017 to
2019 which is not true um so according
to this AI uh the president was
inaugurated four years before after he
became president so he's time traveling
back in back in time got inaugurated and
was also vice president at the same time
I don't know how he did it but this AI
is obviously hallucinating you can't be
vice president president and be
inaugurated four years later all at the
same time okay like the AI should be
able to not that also I asked something
about World War I oh we have a chat I
almost missed something hello a am I
from Texas yes sir the sign says based
in Houston Texas all right um
where were we oh yeah I asked you
something about World War II I gave me
this really really big nice paragraph I
think this on the one bite model and it
it was a really really really long
paragraph So It Goes in like World
War World War II also known as the
second world war is one of the most
defining events in modern history began
with the conflict of Allied Powers it
goes back into 1939 tells me 50 million
people died gives me an ESS that
contains the key events it traces back
to the T of Versa and then German
annexation of Austria and then the munic
agreement allowing Nazi Germany to uh
get Austria blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah lots of text lots of text lots
of text until it tells me that the allly
Sher 36 Maron casualties the unit war
with the united with the United Nations
Charter in June 19 and then it just goes
Haywire it tells me June 19 c c r t d
squ Crossing
clain communication conflict
clam clam clam clam clam clam here you
go it's on the screen and I just stopped
it after that so apparently this offl in
AI you can give me a good
maybe I don't know one page half a page
of essay about the um about World War II
all of this looks factual and correct I
got the date correct but one date just
tripped it up and it just sounds like
you are going off script and you don't
know what you're saying okay anyway
let's get to nothing and then we're
going to get to AA hoer who apparently
I've been attacked people I've been
attacked my use of AI is apparently
quote unquote sinful and um that's why
we've detached ourselves from certain
things but here we go let's go to B not
Bible best sorry uh Mr who's the
boss uh his show I here he talks about
the Samsung devices but they're okay
they're okay oh the Galaxy Ring the
Galaxy ring is interesting I need to get
to the Samsung store to see it but this
this is one actually one of the more
interesting products of you so let's get
to
work oh and also
this for
the YouTube that my
phone this is the new nothing cmf phone
one and I don't say this very often but
I think this is a genius product cmf is
a new budget sub brand of the company
nothing so we're talking a phone that so
let me sync my headphone to my thing one
thing I don't like about these
headphones is that you are forced to
pair them with the case you can't like
hold anything all right here you got 70%
battery right let's go let's go cost2
200 or $250 $250 in United States sorry
sorry okay it's actually a little bit
crazy what these guys have just pulled
off for that price I mean the first
thing you'll notice is this doesn't feel
like just a single product launch this
is an entire no this is what they call
in the business I've never one but it's
called a review's kit so some of the
stuff that he may be getting is not what
you would get if you say would divide
this into United States of America um
You probably won't get all the extra
cases and things of of the like right
but let's continue
on also you w beginning to watch with it
as well you but but this is just the
phone so I think it comes with the phone
and the cable and the box and if you
want these uh these actually you want
cases as you'll see later in the video
they actually screw onto the back of the
phone really fascinating one so let's
get the phone out first there's a
lanyard which is not something you tend
to see launch with a phone one case two
cases but the ecosystem products that
they're showing off on on display oh
three cases a card wallet I guess that's
for the back of the phone there's a
stand the buds Pro two and then the
watch Pro two and it all feels very new
because we've seen plenty of budget
phones before but what you don't often
get is a budget accessory ecosystem
which makes sense like phones like say
the Galaxy a15 some in the mot G power
series you don't really see uh things
coming out with it I mean if with
Samsung you might get some cases but
you're not going to see a lanyard you're
not going to see a special watch that
for it though there is the Galaxy watch
Fe but I think the Galaxy watch Fe is
actually still more expensive than a15
depending on when you get it either May
on samsung.com or on contract the people
are even with eBay
uh on eBay so you may not want to get
that watch because if you can afford the
watch there not really a reason to get
the phone
um to get that phone because it would
make more sense to spend more on a phone
and where to spend on a watch
but you actually I think they're about
the same price but I mean the Watchers
are more like a secondary buy so if I
had say $300 and I spent 150 on the
watch and 150 on the phone I rather just
add up and buy a$ phone e system like
this all designed to work specifically
around that budget phone as the
centerpiece everything the problem with
this is the people who buy budget phones
right there there's usually a high
turnover U over you right people aren
holding on to the Galaxy a15s for five
years long not holding on to the say
a the M G powers like five years for
years and years and years and years as
people will do like with some flagships
right average time in the United States
about three years but these budget
phones they just you buy them and then
you use them maybe get two soft updates
and then you get another one from your
carry when your contract rent out right
which is about two years 18 months in
United
States everything has well problem with
that is these accessories if if nothing
changes design slightly just a little
slightly then they're not going to work
anymore and people probably AR going to
buy into as much like when people buy
say an iPhone 10 right when people get
iPhones they're like big events people
get them for like Christmas and at least
in the commercials for Christmas and New
Year's like the gifts that people who
are dating give to each other right and
for less thing Samsung I guess but
mostly iPhones which are the popular
expensive phones here in the United
States right people hold on those things
for a long time right i' I've seen
people in the past few years still
carrying around iPhone 7S which as you
know launched in 2016 um kids you know
carrying around proper phone at my
school would be the iPhone 13 right or
maybe even the 14 right so they hold on
to these things for a fairly long time
so it makes sense that they'll get maybe
a $30 case or anything like that but
even even cases right s23 Ultra to s24
ultra the cases don't exactly fit but
here I got my new DA case actually sent
a 5,000 one which is why it's so skinny
um for my
s23 four Ultra right but it's 40 s23 I
could technically fit it in but it
barely fit I'm pretty sure that a non
battery non-- rigid
case would you know fit on the s23 s24
but budget phones I mean sometimes they
like to play around with those things
sometimes they like to change it up cuz
they know this is going to be the most
popular selling phone so it doesn't
really matter and people aren't really
going to buy expensive $30 cases for
them so they try to get all the money
off of you know people buying new phones
and also maybe subscription so maybe
throw in some Disney plus some Netflix
for six months and then they keep paying
on top of that on top of that because
you know you were getting what 10 years
ago but have been a super powerful
computer and the problem your hands for
$185 you're not even paying the whole
$185 you're paying like $15 a month
maybe finish that off in 12 months so it
really would make sense to build an s
ecosystem on top of it especially
accessories that you physically screw
into your phone right you change a
millimeter of that the screws aren't
going to screw in it's not going to
work and a slightly cheap thin plasticky
feel to it on the your phone like like
like a Lego really Tastefully designed
it kind of feels like all of these
products have had high-end thought and
Care put into them even if the physical
materials and the Finish are more basic
so like these are the cmf buds 2 Pro and
even though they're very light and
clearly not a luxury item they still
feel sophisticated and intentional in I
don't know why they're so bright though
like I'm pretty sure the CIA could see
from a satellite with those things
design not like a cheap version of
something that the company would rather
you buy and then the watch Pro two mhm
yeah it's slick clean you never want a
watch to go too crazy on design I like
that the C that square doesn't make it
look like you own an iPhone like that
which this is obviously for people who
don't want iPhones like there a bunch of
phones out there that look a little bit
like iPhones the new phone $300 looks a
little bit like an iPhone 11 Pro right
you can get a motor older phone you kind
of I guess has triangle phones besides
this is a nothing phone I have never
seen a nothing phone in person in real
life especially in the United States of
America they don't sell them here you
have to like buy them online so this
phone is for people who a know what cmf
is if I went outside and say hey I have
$50 if you tell me what the phone brand
cmf stands for I go outside they won't
be able to tell me they won't be able to
tell me okay kids can't even answer
basic questions uh to me you'll see that
in the Ethan sh SS lcw Series right they
can't even answer but basic questions
you think we're gonna know what cmf is
no unless they watching the podcast
which as of this time one person is and
they're probably living here it's not
they're not going to know what cmf
stands for okay so people buy these
phones are people who are actively
looking away from the iPhone right so I
would expect that their watch to not at
all look like an Apple Watch on Apple
product like their Bud look like earbuds
but that's how most earbuds look for
some reason they say it's for touch
controls or for stability or something
like that I don't know I'm not a big
earbud user as like an earbud power user
because I have the phone in the screen
in my hand I can do stuff like that the
best I can do it might be like voice
control then it won't match your outfits
so this feels like a pretty appropriate
level to me right let's get into this
phone it's a thin package so we all know
what that means okay so the device is on
top and below that is a kind annoying
that they didn't sell sell the Char in
the Box I do not care that your phone is
recyclable it's quote unquote saving the
environment doesn't matter I want to
charge in the box also Samsung to you I
want micr SD card SL back in my phone
still please Eric White USBC to they
have on a15 but I'm not going out there
and buying an a15 I've used an a15
before um it's a nice phone it's kind of
slow but I rather have an s34
Ultra which you should be able to use to
transfer everything from your old phone
and then an orange Sim ejector right
heel
time that music is
[Music]
nice how should I plant this if my
garden doesn't receive direct
sunlight no I I like that going out
there and showing more ads for their AI
you know sometimes you forget about it
and I think it's interesting that they
integrated into
other releasing is this car yeah yeah do
you mind if I ask you what and right off
the bat it's pretty clear that this is
not your normal phone and it's it's not
just that it looks different cuz you
know these cases that I showed you these
are actually back plates so if you look
inside the packaging they came in you'll
see a bunch of other stuff like they
allow you access to the back of the
phone but they don't allow removable
battery which makes sense um
these these days like moov battery
someone takes that take the battery out
game over I guess they could do the same
thing with Sim but it actually you have
the scoot is out so it' be game over in
like five minutes but
still anymore you can actually use your
phone naked guilt-free knowing that I
don't know lots of phones are
plastic right and while it would be more
expensive to say replace the plastic on
a budget phon
do you really want to have to unscrew
plastic and stuff also I be willing to
I'd be interested in seeing drop test
and say let's say I sh a plastic you
drop it on a rock the plastic instead of
SP cracking outward cracks Inward and
maybe parchur the battery it's not like
the battery is replaceable too so I
would probably still maybe use a case if
they make cases for these
phones but I I mean look at the case I
have here okay I mean my camera is
almost in capable of hitting the ground
because I have a nice 10,000 Milli
battery if you ever do do something
stupid you can just swap the back plate
out for I mean it's not even that much
money £29 is what they're charging maybe
$34 which is that is I'd say about the
price of a good case but I mean most
cases clar case it's
fine for these kits including the tools
the third thing screwdriver is it means
you can mix and match so I really like
this orange back it swaps out the
slightly cheap feeling very scratchable
plastic for a more grippy less
scratchable vegan leather type finish
and that is nice though that you can
change the literal material of your
phone right because I I think it would
be nice if we had Le phones right a Le
phone would solve the problems of
uh say wireless charging which you can't
get in metal phones and heating U also
signal metal phones I see why we moved
away from them first of all metal a
phone is a signal Grabber as you guys
know so you know how iPhones have those
little side things those are antennas to
get the signal right second of all metal
bends uh iPhones and third of all metal
it's hard to get the water dis charging
coils to and in plastic plastic is nice
I'm Pro plastic right um one of the
articles I wrote on my article was the
plastic is back when Samone introduce
plastic to their phones uh using the
glastic technology so you know on the uh
lowend and note 20 they had glasstic on
the back of their phones or the Note 10
I believe there was some glasstic a some
of the higher um a phones they used to
make like a71 there's glasstic on the Fe
there's glasstic I'm I'm I'm team
glastic right but Samsung knows that
people want to have afford not
affordability Aesthetics in the palm of
their hand uh unfortunately that's
because the uh the
iPhone um
of how the iPhone
Works um which which has been metal and
then glass metal and glass only now for
for very very long time right so but Le
people like Le and since it's vegan Le
you don't insult the vegans or whatever
when animal abuse p is not gonna come
screaming at you for existing but um it
it's nice to hold right if you drop it
it shock absorb it rather than say
plastic which is just hard glass with
can sometimes C crack and if it
scratches you can kind of maybe get
it fix it a little bit and also I think
it's water Palette too and it's bright
orange so let's put it on also I like to
see how these cases like maybe a gaming
test or heat stress test how these cases
work
differently when not how the cases work
how how the phone Heats differently and
performs differently with different back
plates on because it can be argued that
certain cases make maybe the vegan other
case trap seat I don't know uh worse
than say the plastic case right that
could be maybe five frames per second in
a video game which it appears that all
this processing power in phones is not
for video editing 3D CAD modeling
because I can't find any good apps for
that it's just for gaming which Speaking
of gaming I did a test on the speed
storm application 3.8 gigabytes mobile
game from Disney it's just racing game
with Mickey Mouse in it it it's so
boring I have the objectively most
powerful gaming phone in the world right
now right well most powerful phone for
gaming in world I guess there's
technically more more powerful game
gaming phones like 16 gigabytes of RAM
and a terab
storage it
whatever like there's not even any good
mobile games that I've heard of I don't
even game right but speed store 3.8
gigabytes of my SSD is being Wasted by
this app that was downloading to test
and speaking of other games on the
server side uh YouTube has games now
built into it I recorded myself playing
them for seven minutes upload them soon
um they are like there little running
games that you see on YouTube ads the uh
Graphics are abysmal but it's
interesting what they have in
there but then I'm looking at the orange
SIM tray the orange circle screw thing
and the silver screw screws that come
with it and thinking silver screws are
pretty nice but for the other parts I
think I prefer the black ones so I have
just created my own two-tone finish on
my phone and that's actually sick but
the best that is nice that's nice part
of this is would be really interesting
if they made this color changing thing
has actually gone one step further to
actually create an ecosystem around
these weird screws and I don't even know
what to call this from now on but I'd be
interesting to see if this ecosystem
lasts five years into the future
also I don't really get the concept of
building ecosystem around a $200 phone
okay first of all you get into the spect
this phone the abysmal who's going to
want to like you let's say you buy extra
back plates you buy all this stuff for
it be spending 100 pounds you could save
all that and buy a better phone right at
the end of the day this thing supposed
to make calls send text and have good
processing power that's your job oh and
out of your
life circle spinny thing so if I want a
phone stand for example unscrew your
circle spinny thing and screw the stand
in and yeah the stand itself isn't
anything particularly special it's not
breaking new grounds in so we we you get
the concept here so let's get let's get
into the
specifications is absolutely amazing my
mind full of functionality without
making it cost them any more to build
this thing you're actually getting
because you're paying for it something
here that you can't get just by paying
through the nose for a higher-end device
like nothing has managed to make
something that gives their $250 phone a
tangible leg up over my $1,200 phone hey
hey don't don't s my s24 ultra first of
all there are cases that allow you to do
things like this right and obviously
dude party you're going to there's not
going to be any third party you know
back plates um for these nothing phones
it's not going to be any third party you
know battery cases like I have for these
nothing phones like a phone stand is
nice and all but you can basically
simulate what nothing is doing here with
a few phone cases there are phone cases
with built-in stands there phone cases
that are different colors in your phone
there clear phone cases it's fine like
the pability aspect whatever also they
don't have some of the tangible features
that come preinstalled as pin right and
the software it's okay but you can still
launch it and that is absolutely amazing
my mind is kind of woring at the
possibilities though it would be
interesting if they they added he's
going to say camera lenses here it would
be interesting if they added a separate
camera um thing here but that that would
mean you need like little NFC tags on
the back of them like Samsung does um
for the Z flip
cases like I'm just thinking as an
example what if you use this screw and
this screw to add a permanent lens
attachment to your cameras you know
instead of those ones that you have to
clip on and anything more than a light
Breeze will remove for you now I would
personally be a little bit worried about
things getting inside they have managed
to get an ipx2 rating which is basically
very minor water protection and nothing
for dust and I think it's somewhat
telling that that which makes sense uh
oh also the CEO is called pay who
famously didn't W to resist
his designed to be taken apart this
easily is obviously not particularly
well sealed and also as cool as the
circle spinny thing is I do find it a
little bit uncomfortable be interesting
if these things could bring things
related to software so maybe you CLE
that you get CLE to search it sticks out
but let me be very clear all in all for
the price this is one of the best
designed phones I've ever seen which I'm
only half surprised by because the
entire name of the sub cmf very
literally stands for colors materials
and finish it's actually the rest of the
phone that surprised me more so let's
talk about it if you're winning with
design at
$250 then where are you losing well it's
not the screen this is a one 12 HZ
adaptive AMOLED full HD Plus display
it's very smooth it's sharp it's
ridiculous why can't Apple I mean I'm
all for Apple not doing this I have 100
H right I mean if Apple keeps this on
long enough the EU which I despise for
doing stuff with
tech the EU has got to force them to
have screen they're gonna be like it's
the uh the digital eye protection act of
2027 it says all humans have the right
to have access great content on great
screens and thus all devices sold in the
EU must have 120
HZ maybe to have Sweden exit up it's
punchy this thing can display HDR 10
plus content which is a luxury that you
could only get by paying over $1,000
like literally two years ago they've pre
again but who I mean you can film in h
10K I mean 10 plus but who
is that on Netflix or anything like that
they're the only streaming apps I have
on here like 3B and 2B and they display
1080p maybe
720p pre-installed a screen protector
which I always rate and this right here
is an in display Optical fingerprint
scanner Optical are nice but I i' read
ultrasonic but you know tradeoffs well
it's fine it works even the brightness
which is one of the first things to go
is actually pretty good the company's
advertising a 2000 nit Peak brightness
but you'd only achieve that in very very
specific situations more typically this
thing can go up to 200 Bri that's pretty
good uh cor of Samsung mine gets up to
2,600 so I'm going to say 2000 is my
quote unquote Peak brightness on normal
conditions I can kind of see iffy
sometimes um but for nothing 1,200 no
what what you say Max of 700 need to
test it out for outside in the H summer
Texas Sun viewing wow we got three
viewers don't even know where they came
from Hello the normal brightness and
then 1 12200 nits in ultra bright
outdoor environments which means that in
the absolute worst worst case scenarios
you might have to squint a little bit
but you'll pretty much never struggle to
see it he's in England okay to get like
three sunny days a year this is Houston
Texas we get sunny days all the time so
it would be different thing I would
complain about and I am being quite
nitpicky here but the bottom bezel is
slightly thicker than the other bezels
and this is particularly interesting
because I remember having a conversation
with K pay the CEO when he launched the
nothing phone too he was basically
explaining how much extra effort cost
and Engineering is required to just
according to the video the screen to
curve around the
edges this bottom lip down a tiny little
bit to even it all out and he made the
decision to still do that on those more
expensive nothing phones but now we're
looking at a phone which is basically
half of that cost I guess he's decided
to let some of those design ideologies
slip a little bit Fair compromise though
I I it's get to the specs of the phone
to process the software the phone has a
5,000 Mah cell that is good the chip is
actually based on the very efficient 4
nanom process the software skin is very
light no thanks to the thousands of apps
I've installed on top of it and I also
notic all black so that I if you grouped
all the black over here and all the
white or screen on you might be
5050 so technically about 50% of the
screen is off because it's an Amal
the phone to dark mode by default with
all black icons which is good because
this AMOLED display will turn off
anywhere it's displaying black pixels to
the point where there is no doubt in my
mind that I will be gracefully carried
through the day by this thing like if I
I once saw on Reddit S Pool of idiots um
people
had phone usage of two days long
combined with 7even hours of screen on
time and start like 15% on my phone on
the s24 which is wild I can barely eek
out five hours in one
day if I just pull up my battery
settings now it's saying I've had 4
hours of screen on time and I'm still on
60% battery that's ridiculous so I'm
currently on track for this thing last
hours of let's see where the time goes I
don't know what now it's 17 o00 okay so
from 11 to 5 at 6 hours on time and I'm
still on 60% battery so I'm currently on
track for this thing lasting 10 hours of
screen 10 hours that would be double my
battery life at when it was a few weeks
ago one time on this charge which am I
ever going to need more than that only
weird thing is even though the phone is
stupidly easy to take apart you still
can't actually swap the battery out
yourself if you decided that your
existing one is getting old which feels
like a missed opportunity to me and the
charging situation is okay there's no
wireless charging and the wire charging
is up to to a pretty mediocre 33 Watts
33 wats is still pretty good my phone
gets up to 45 I don't have a charger for
that but I read reports that 25 and 45
are about the same apparently on Samsung
devices and 33 watch is good but they
don't give you the charger on the dev Bo
so it's unlikely that someone's going to
go out and buy spend extra money on a
charger since you don't get the charging
brick to achieve that wattage I imagine
most people will be operating under that
but the important thing is the battery
life and the battery life
it's not a bad level of support it's
pretty standard at this T which is no
doubt a big part of where good results
they never seem to look too AI generated
if you know what I mean and you're
getting that with 2 years of major
Android updates and 3 years of security
updates which is and you know the a
features they're basically making the
software by now no doubt a big part of
where money is saved compared to the
more expensive nothing phone 2 for
example it's not a bad level of support
it's pretty standard at this tier it's
just it's nothing spectacular but
it's inside this phone that for me was
the biggest wild card I had no idea what
to expect the phone's got 6 GB of RAM on
the base model and 128 gigs of storage
interestingly expandable storage with up
to a 2 TB SD card that's need but even
nothing under more expensive phones
doesn't even do that which is weird and
it's paired with a mediatech chipset the
dimensity 7300 and the reason that I
didn't know what to expect is well at
least on paper the dimensity 7300 is
actually less powerful than the 7200
[Music]
which someone please explain the math to
me but anyway this is what that looks
like in practice so this is the latest
game from hoyo verse the company who
made genin impact and I don't know what
this game is called let me check it
check it
out speaking of let see you got any more
chat no no okay all you say
ginin it is Yo hoo verus urban fantasy
RPG I don't know what that is whatever
providing I'm on game mode which you can
access by just swiping in from the left
I can play it at a pretty acceptable
frame rate hovering at mostly High
settings but even though there is a
liquid calling system on the inside I
have noticed the performance declining
with prolonged gaming so if I don't want
it to get laggier I'd like to see how it
does on more pronounceable in popular
games uh like Roblox uh you may think
Roblox doesn't take a lot of processing
power actually you have good internet
speeds and rendering maybe I'm not sure
um Asphalt 9 is the game I always used
to test devices I I don't game so I
really would know and also emulation I'm
pretty sure with that then I'll get a
more stable experience if I go down to
medium settings so if you factor in that
this is as demanding as mobile games get
then there isn't anything that you won't
be able to play but you will have to
make new which is weird because if this
phone is able to play the most demanding
mobile game at say high medium settings
then a phone double the price with maybe
a better let's take this phone put a
Snapdragon agent 3 be able to play any
phone thing in the world so I are games
getting more
powerful Samsung agent plus one was a
beloved chip why aren't we still using
that um I mean agentry I know brings the
AI features but aside from
that noticeable compromises to how some
games look and on a day-to-day basis
doing research on like what people are
doing with computer networks and
research and databases and things like
that with computers and say the 90s I
didn't say text based stuff right
because there wasn't you know as
powerful internet connection so we
people AR Outsourcing everything the web
apps and the cloud they have to do
everything on device we have multiple
dudes more powered on this and the most
powerful thing I can do on here is say
maybe a little a bit of video editing
this it doesn't feel slow but it also
doesn't feel particularly fast the lag
maybe improving the animation speed
would be better and let's get to the
cameras cameras but it's a little bit of
a weird one because the top camera is
actually just an assist camera you can
deathu which is weird that we're still
seeing that back in it's 2024 okay this
is a popular thing maybe back in 2020
that fo your phones and say Hello
Elijah it's very funny to for your
friends into thinking that you have like
a three camera phone woo and it's
nothing hold your finger over it and
still perform basically every single
function of your phone's camera the only
thing that you can't do without it is
add the portrait mode effect to your
shots so if I take this photo while
covering the lens it'll look like this
if I take the same photo after having
removed my finger it will look like this
what are those photos that does look
very good look like well very nicely
detailed you have plenty of room to zoom
in further and they will still look
sharp the wide aperture and decent
sensor size gets you some I would like
maybe have a wiing or a telephoto zoom
camera on there an alternative to that
and then some better software processing
all right well it's time for a Haru
a all right so
let's get into a Harper as you guys know
a Harper is our artificial intelligence
influencer and as I was criticized for
using AI to quote unquote I'm a liar for
using AI that was the nothing cmf phone
so was made by nothing sub brand cmf I I
was criticized for lying uh for using AI
which I of course refuted okay as you
guys know I'm very good at evading
questions very very good Simply the Best
um aop is our influencer and we will not
be combined by people who try to you
know invent random rules okay we would
like forget all these rules okay as long
as in the to it is good all right so not
anymore it is all Road 300 by the end of
this August we will have 300 no by the
end of this month we will have 300 I am
proclaiming it right here
by we will have over by
2025 we will have right ,000 followers
on Instagram for a Harper she will
become the greatest and most powerful
artificial intelligence influencer in
the world and my goodness we won't
commit a sin by doing that okay we will
not commit any sins we we're not going
to back down we Face criticism we face
pushback but we're gonna overcome here a
hoer is not backing down our competition
as you know it's not the as Michael mes
would say the quote unquote AI demon
Spirit of the world but it's actually
the team AG girls of the world and
that's why we officially declaring war
on them and as you guys know from the SS
ltw series we don't lose Wars to teenage
girls as it's
unconstitutional we will not lose this
war a harer is as we can see on the
screen it is coming up
scientifically uh and allergically
athetic so scientifically modeled to be
allergically aesthetic that's an
official thing this is application um
inside the two ways photo editing
application that um prescribes the
alleged attractiveness of people
according to a
database
um according to a
database so let me show it to
you um a
hor wait a
there it
is that's right AA Harper is
scientifically coded to be allegedly
attractive attractive the year is wrong
he's 20 but 10 out of 10 is good and yes
people we commit TS all the time all the
time all right so scientifically coded
to be Alle oh you can't even see there
we go scientifically coded to be
allegedly attractive AA Haro 10 out of
10 right now all the calculations
correct America you decide and not me
because a lot of people said it was
accurate Yes except for one kid who said
it was off by 15 points because he gave
someone 125 out of 10 am I goingon to
say that was accurate absolutely not am
I gonna walk into that National Security
nightmare absolutely not am I gonna
claim that on live TV that it works n
barely that makes zero sense okay I'm a
great question evader okay I've evaded
these types of questions before I'm not
going to walk into into a trap on live
TV talking about AA Harper okay but back
to the war okay it may seem that real
girls so I read it again say of idiots
girls are real real girls have the power
of movement so you know they can do
videos they have the power of um alleged
attractiveness the survey um from uh not
survey a research study using AI tools
from our website back in January shows
that um I guess this would be back shows
that 15% of comments under 100 girls
um Instagrams are quote allergically
sick attractive on Instagram so it's
about appearances right unfortunately AA
Harper exactly very skilled the most
skilled unfortunately AA
har nor to ever attend a high school and
so does the whole why you follow me on
Instagram for whatever does not exist in
able harbers universe so see
she's that a zero okay unfortunately
that whole Instagram follow thing that
people do in the real world doesn't
exist for ail Haru right every Haru
doesn't have this power so does she
can't get 900 followers with three posts
true fact that actually that's a
reference to someone I know even if even
though she doesn't really have the
capability of movement invoice inance
right now okay as technology uh comes
out still have better capabilities but
the thing
is even though it may seem that they
have better advantages because they have
the capability of movement they have the
capability
of uh knowing what all these fashion
trends and poses are they have the
capability to do better reals than just
a whole bunch of vide uh pictures
basically slideshows right we have
analytics knowledge we are
scientifically coded 10 out of 10 that
10 out of 10 that is what we are
scientifically coded to be right okay
that 10 out of 10 according to the
application was not hit very often right
and even if AA doesn't hit it we can
code AA to be better you can't code
someone else to be better it's not how
it works unfortunately right um so even
though we have to use chat gbt and CLE
to search and image scanning to identify
student poses and clothing because as
you can see I'm not a girl so I'm not I
don't know what those things are we
still have the advantage we have
unlimited clothing right if you were to
take every piece of article of clothing
that a hopper wears on
Instagram that would cost insane amounts
of money insane but we all get it for
free the other girls cannot and now I
guess they could take pictures of
themselves and then change the clothing
with AI image editing applications it
would look fake we can look fake because
it's in the description therefore we're
not lying that it's a digital influencer
right with the terms of service and
statistics as my guide we will produce
and we will create and we're going to
make AA great we have access to
unlimited amounts of clothing for free
money is No Object and with this we
declare war um not on the other AI they
can do whatever the heck they want but
on real humans and we will win if we
lose it's unconstitutional so okay I'm
it's time to who vote this it's about to
be an evangelo on prodcts have the
greatest AI influencer in the world so
speaking of unburdened let's turn to
this clip of things as you guys
know I always like to go outside and see
what the phones are that people are
using in videos in
technology right that that's what I'm
noticing from here
okay
so I've noticed
certain
phones uh in
videos
um all right here we go this is an
article from a
thing it's a thing called a website
actually
um what is it um
I'm not going to Tik
Tock yeah the BET Awards apparently the
vice president was there quote out here
in these streets whatever that means
um blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah blah it's an ad ad okay yeah yipes
okay I just want to see the clip all
right here we go I don't care whatever
they're saying they G be yapping about
Samsung for all I care we got to look at
the
awful awful
editing and is I mean it
is it is astounding I'm not talking
about the photo editing like I said I
always look at
phones
um uh
phones in
in in
videos um I'm trying to pull it up
here when did this happen when were the
battle
wordss I I don't remember when the
battle wordss
were I don't even know what's it stand
for Black
Entertainment
[Music]
uh oh yeah that was my live blogging
from uh
uh that was my live blog
from
Samsung uh unpacked which we talked
about earlier in the podcast
episode oh here it is it's GNA be on the
media and I drove an image
should be here
somewhere okay I
gotta where is it dang okay hopefully
you guys can see it on the screen anyone
have any questions that I may or may not
answer or may or may not evade and by
the way AA Harper is gonna win even if
the Instagram app is being glitchy and
not
working oh here we go here we go so
these people I don't know who the other
women is uh is FaceTiming I believe uh
that's what they're supposed to be doing
they're not actually FaceTiming so I
guess they're fake timing um so here you
got your iPhone I'm pretty sure that's
real and this woman I have no idea who
she is again this is muted I I could
care less who she is or what she's
doing I want to see the whole video oh
there it is there it is Boom
what on Earth is this
people oh man this
is this is awful first of all your Notch
uh yeah I'm fre to Apple would like to
have that Notch but this is an Apple ad
even if this is grainy that is a tiny
pale Notch I'm sorry you cannot fit face
ID in there make the hole bigger okay
second of all this is not what face ID
looks like uh not face ID FaceTime looks
like there was no x button right there
at the top so first of all that's not
ergonomic in the least why wouldn't it
be down there but whatever okay um
yeah second of all and the third thing
that you know how it's fake is how
crystal clear the video quality is I
mean if you had this uh video quality
that would be amazing but I mean I don't
care what the UI looks like that Notch
is abysmal first of all Apple would
stand for that you have so much wasted
space I'm sorry this I just noticed you
irregularity is in media all the
time I'm not talking about what he's
saying I care less about what he's
saying whatever I'm talking about how
bad this phone looks on camera I mean
maybe this is in 720p so you can't
really see it but I I I saw this video
Whatever school buses Vin diagrams who
cares uh look at this
the notch is terrible this okay first of
all the hold is Tiny second of all the
the amount of spacing in between there
is awful okay do you know why I saw that
Notch do you know why I saw that notch
on some ad that didn't cost me millions
of dollars to make okay you think you
think this is free no this wasn't
free okay I'm sorry that that ad was not
free whoever edited that video should be
fired because it would be fine if I made
that if I made that for a glory News
Network video at uh in the uh sslw
series if I made that for I not the Bo
yet right whatever who cares right it's
all it's uh it's all it's free and also
I would hope that the vice president and
whoever that lady was uh has higher
access to technology um than me because
also apparently according to my private
AI application which is good and also
awful at the same time
um the president can time travel if we
have the capability of time travel then
uh yeah that phone is janky like the
phone is real but the screen capture is
absolutely fake the software is terrible
okay and think about it whoever that
woman is uh I don't know maybe maybe
she's 30 40 years old right and the vice
president she's like what 59 on the
tying tiebreaking vote in the Senate
okay remember the episode we were
talking about they trying to ban like
social media and add restrictions and
stuff if you can't even draw a phone
correctly something that I've been able
to do for a long time maybe just maybe
you shouldn't legalize stuff I I don't
know maybe I'm not an expert but at
least I can draw a phone I've been
drawing phones for a long time and I
never have I ever drawn a phone that
looked that bad in my life that
phone I'm sorry it looks awful that
phone looks awful okay but here we
go
um who's will we see this and yes maybe
my ad looks objectively worse but hey my
ad cost 0 to make not hundred of
thousands of dollars second of all I'm
not running an election right I when I
made an election ad I actually use good
editing software to use it on my phone
it's really easy hey call me I'll make
one for you you have to pay me but I'll
make one for you here we
go you see that see that guys guys guys
look it's screen capture on a face phone
for an app that you can use for
$17.99 by the way this is the Elijah
that's in the chat right there Elijah ml
is the Elijah who is in the green circle
so he's he's famous here guys look the
phone doesn't even have a notch I can't
believe it I can't believe it and guess
what I didn't have to go out and buy two
iPhones to do this I don't even have
this phone it's not a real
phone this is this is in CGI for an app
on a social network that four people use
four whole people and one of them is me
okay so if my ads here are getting
compared to uh presidental ad maybe just
maybe your editing seems to be a little
B oh look at that you got the OnePlus uh
eight right here and yeah yeah yeah yeah
oops it's me that's whatever I this dang
what happened to a f oh my goodness
whatever um I'm sorry that is embarrass
the Notch was too small it's too it
wasn't even close enough to the ceiling
you've insulted youve insulted Apple
like I understand why Apple doesn't
allow people to use their devices in
movies uh unless you get like a contract
from them because imagine insulting
Apple in that in that egregious way that
that is that was an insult to Apple that
an insult to uh Apple which is an
American company and it's an insult to
my intelligence because they didn't
think I would catch on or anyone would
catch on I mean even people who want in
Tech caught on to that janky janky F
shameful all
right
um so we've gotten through our points
for today we got talked about the
nothing phone we can talk more about
samsung.com we talked about that stupid
janky phone that was in that ad and we
also talked about how Ava Haru is gonna
win Ava Haru is going to be great and AA
Harper is going to uh as the line um of
the things said unburden what has been
whatever that means all right
so Galaxy zold
6 Galaxy Z fold
6 is the newest foldable phone in
Samsung's
whoa Unfortunately they had a price hike
but but he look at this they have a
speaker right there uh on the top of the
phone and on on the top it looks really
good and it looks like s24 Ultra so I I
really like that hopefully the s pin
does work on
the front of the screen hopefully
hopefully I need to get my hands on this
phone to go to the Samsung store Circle
to search gets more features here I do
miss Google screen search where you
could highlight something and then it'll
pop up and you get like uh context uh
search for what was on the screen
searching on your screen has always been
available so I don't understand why this
is a new AI quote unquote feature feels
like AI it's a tag that there sticking
on to things also they've integrated
chat stuff on on this phone with Gemini
I would have wish Samsung hello Robert C
we've just talking about your country uh
England so miss is the
boss um I I would have wished that
Samsung had the own chat because Jim
light is censored and awful
Gemini G I cannot it's okay like see see
guys look look I am willing to call out
Google when they do wrong but Google
search is better than duck. go I don't
care how much quote unquote tracking
that they're doing maybe they're doing
the tracking because it makes s better
but Gemini I'd rather use coper over
Gemini all right you got ched in another
language using interpr on AI That's good
again interpreter translation always
available summarizing the blink of in AI
that's good because that's a new feature
that I added in here effortless photo
editing oh yes yes the photo editing
features they finally got a little bit
upgraded because you can draw something
and will input it into the image imagine
the capability of
fakes that's gonna be great but again
all these features are going to be
coming probably to the zone 5 probably
they better be coming to 24 Ultra so I
don't really see how I you can't really
sell a software update Apple tried that
with the S uh Apple Char with the iPhone
10r not 10r 10s uh versus the iPhone 10
and the Apple so people bought it but
like my cousin asked me hey I just got
the iPhone 10 uh right after the iPhone
10s came out I was like I was 11 at this
time I was like come on this phone has
basically the same camera same design
maybe a little bit bigger battery but
it's it's the same phone with the
software
update all right but remember Samsung is
not apple and I don't want them to
become
Apple except in terms of website design
maybe maybe do that oh you got sketched
image which I would like I would really
okay that looks fake but that is nice I
would like a there to be more context aw
recognition images here you got portra
Studio works and then you got Gemini on
here but I don't get how this is a
feature wow guys you got an app you can
get into place store that's nice
whatever that's not really integration
and you still got the fingerprint
scanner here it's light it's thin honor
said that it's not the thinest whatever
I don't care that's H gives me one then
I will nicely review it for them all
right um and there it is in 3D I wish I
knew if the s pin worked on the C screen
that would be nice uh that's all that's
happened in tech for for a week but it's
only been an hour so we still have one
more hour left of podcasting fun so if
you guys have any
questions um feel free to ask them at
this time in terms of you know
technology oh student counsil so I
finally got a God
loving okay I'm just testing the lag on
here uh yes San finally hit Reddit we
got a God loving uh person who want who
values student council coming in here so
you know if you're
listening um please feel free
to
talk also our latest SS ltw in
installation has uh hit this is when
this is a base in October and yes even
though I have the club I'm trying to
base it around advention Odyssey
episodes that came out around that time
it's almost Leger okay so according to
the uh
according to this story ss.
blogspot.com
um this is when I am running around um
asking kids about what they do when they
have sleepovers and how they make
friends and stuff like that so it
details the time that we go out and we
um well that I go out and ask kids um
about sleepovers based on the episode
when all the kids and I having a
sleepover at each other's house um
interesting that it's
a what's it called Co coed sleepover
interesting from Focus there uh but
whatever uh oh nice brand new M3 mag
what are you gonna do with it anyway
back to the episode
uh where am I oh uh
I'm freezing up oh yeah yeah back epis I
was asking kids like if they ever cook
on a lampshade if people ever try to
sneak into do their sleepover and also I
told the at the uh time uh the the
numbers are G to change as the story
goes on the 10th ninth most powerful
kids in the school that they should make
sure that their phones are not tapped
when they are having a sleepover and
telling each other Secrets because that
would not be a good thing if your phone
got tapped and leaked and then your
status in school
fell
um yeah so please go check that out it's
all true and then the next story uh part
two is going to detail um how I
investigate a
missing uh a bag into school and install
security cameras in the lockers so any
questions from Elijah or
Robert or from our listening
audience my computer's acting really
slow here I only have like 10 10 tabs
open uh which is really really really
sad so all SS ltw it's having a great
run and I hope to do more podcast
episodes um for it like do a full
podcast series about it and you know we
still have so much to cover we got to
cover the space program of eighth grade
we got to cover the chases of 12th grade
and seventh grade we got to cover the um
formation of a new alliance um in in
school um we got to cover the
I was list I was listening back to old
student council tapes yesterday and
things people say on tape are pretty on
hin so we got to go into the sanitized
version of student council tapes we got
to go into the
uh we have so much story left to tell on
there and also lots of lots of advice to
give to the listening kids of the world
so any any comment
from any of our listening
audience we might react to some national
anthem films we might do that tell me if
you guys want to see that and I may
comply with your
requests so I just wait a few seconds
here to see what the audience wants if
they say that and yes if no then we'll
go into some zold six video
videos uh if these videos
load I don't see anything here so I
guess uh the people haven't oh sounds
good to me oh Elijah made it all right
so let's let's go to the video let me
type it in here oh also we are now
reacting to Snapchat stories uh which
feature totally insane people chatting
with each other uh because you guys you
guys kind of liked our national Em
parody
uh Galaxy tech review hello welcome to
the chat um thank you for sending me all
that all those goodies uh few I guess
years ago um really enjoyed it I still
have the USB hubs and everything there
so thank you so
much yeah so you guys really liked our
parody is you got 21 views that's decent
um compared to like one short here so we
um are adding more shorts
here there should be another short
here it's called
uh it's
called something it's called Snapchat
reaction part one yeah man no problem
having what I can figure out how how
much it is to ship oh wow thanks so much
I'd be really interested in testing out
some more um devices and
gear like that so I think we're going to
do
uh you might make that reaction video
just a separate video and then do
um here we go zold 6 if it's an upgrade
versus a gimmick uh compared to say the
z45 because I really didn't see any new
changes there I didn't Maybe different
chip so maybe on device EI processing
would be better but the off device stuff
is all Serv so as long as it has good
processing capabilities you know has a
good modem um which Speaking of
modems
I the BBS um but unfortunately I didn't
have a modem on of course we don't have
dial up here because it's not 1990 and
this is an advent Odyssey so I was TR to
dial into BBS and I could work with my
virtual modem emulation software so kind
of sad there all right so let's showare
this video this is I think he's in New
York or he might be in Paris I'm not
sure which Paris fun fact they're having
the Olympics there so Samsung will live
stream the ceremony on a boat using a
private 5G network using I think 50
Galaxy s24 Ultras so I like to see how
that works out well last time s to get
something live people noticed I didn't
really notice that was four years ago uh
what a shot their entire live Samsung
event using Galaxy s20
Ultra has a lot of big upgrades and a
lot of them I think are pretty important
I want to talk about one in particular
in this video but before we get into
that I do want to let you know if yall
are interested in buying one uh I have
an affiliate Link in the description you
can take that it go straight to the
website and you can get an extra $100
well you get $100 in credit towards
accessories which is a cool thing
because there are a lot of upgrades we
have the Snapdragon 8 generator seven
years and I got to say a little
skeptical I mean the thing is and I
think I know where he was going with
this the Galaxy Z like original G no
it's not original the Galaxy Z4 2 right
which is the first really big
success um folding phone for Samsung the
G one it was fine but it had like a
really tiny
screen um they really didn't want you
use that screen the g 2 had a Bez list
display and then the three bought the SP
pin right you don't really see that too
many folding phones you don't really see
too many people using those folding
phones anymore right it may because
those people you know these are some of
the Cutting Edge of technology so they
like to upgrade you over you but it's
because um and the flip is a bit more
popular because it's you know priced as
a phone should be
$9.99 the the fold it doesn't
capture the screen isn't is n as doable
as it needs to be I just probably most
people are and I want to talk about that
in this video because first we came out
with the Google pixel phone and the
pixel 8s and they're like seven years of
support and we're like wow that's a long
time and then the s24 series came out
we're like bam Double Down 7 years of
support which is which is good I get
seven years of support on my phone how
probably years this maybe two three four
years uh as long right so I probably
won't use it for the full seven years of
software support right I'm expecting the
battery to get better let's see I can
get can't I guess get past the folding
phones crease on folding until I figure
out how to get rid of that I'll stick to
to this small phon that's an interesting
take here Samsung did talk about the
crease on their phone which is now only
100 millimeters instead of
180 um so that's interesting I guess
however I've seen some of the Chinese
folding phones um don't have the creases
anymore but you know no Google mobile
services is I'd say a bit bigger than a
crease right so I don't think that the
SZ fold series doesn't have the
processor processing capabilities of to
do
this I want to see if Mr mobile has a
video out he might I I'm pretty sure the
processing capabilities has the same
processor that's in my phone it should
hold up all these time all this time I'm
not sure so about the battery of course
it's technically smaller than the
battery on my phone while having power
two screens or three I guess but
the phone
technology the screen technology it's
probably not up it's not ready
yet so let's talk about the mobile Razer
folks
right make a Mr mobile because I really
like Mr mobile videos I think I pretty
much summarized Happy Birthday Marty oh
no you don't let me get this you know it
would be nice if they brought back the Z
2 I think there's still around during
the three promotion that they
had but in 2017 vable phones were
already kind of out not as refoldable
glass but they had um Motorola phone no
Motorola ZT some company it was two 3.5
inch phones that were basically stapled
together on a
hinge in fact the M the Atrix um the the
M Atrix had
a lap do all the way back in 2011
so so the M had lapt all back in 2011 so
it really wouldn't make sense for that
like here we have a uh rollable evu from
2006 and this is an actual product
that's in someone's hand um that's not
real the software still looks bad it is
the kyira echo there it is it's a dual
screen folding phone you have the bezel
here two 3.5 in screen share right
there which it kind of reminds me of I
never had one of these uh DS Nintendo DS
is that what it's called the gaming
console
um that's what that's what it reminds me
of but just in like a smartphone for
fact let's get let's get into the motal
uh phones which I've been really seeing
out I know some kids that have them um I
know that they in Caro stores a lot and
even in best buyers and I think that's a
really good strategy here to get to the
$699 $4.99 Doll Market and of course
being Caro stores thanks you're too kind
I've heard that unlimited 2% cash back
the Wells Fargo active cash credit
card at Metro get a new iPhone 12 with
5G take a uh by the way the iPhone 15's
I don't it's not new amazing pictures
and share instantly you don't sponsored
by surf
shark to paraphrase the late Anthony
Bourdain sometimes I just need that
oldtime flavor it's Al it's very
interesting how many phones this man has
like I don't have any M phones excluding
his review unit here one two three four
five six seven eight nine 10 motorol
phones all from obviously the previous
decade 20 years ago with the help of
some hot star power Motorola reshaped
humdrum mobile phones into design icons
with the first razor and it's spent the
past five way the razor is completely
overrated didn't have really good
internet support in 2004 it it was a
super basic flip phone with terrible
software and even for 2004 you can go
back set your time to 2007 2004 the
razor
isn't yeah that is a lot of phones the
razor is beloved because it's popular
because I don't know why it's popular or
was popular but the phone itself was not
that good even in 2004 you could have
gotten a better phone like my favorite
phone that I've never owned would be the
T-Mobile danger uh hiptop you got a
camera some did have uh internet
connectivity and email all and servo
suus back in 2005 that backed up
everything to the cloud suus that got
hacked and some famous person got hacked
because I don't think they use like
encryption or anything like that because
it was 2005 but
still the that phone would be more
technologically advanced and it's pushed
for teenagers than say the M Razer of
2004 I don't really get why it's Bel
here reformulating that reinvention into
this kind like how you an iPhone is
below right you go back you look at the
phones at that time the Nokia n95 the
Samsung Galaxy Blackjack more advanced
maybe not the black but obviously n95
you got GPS great storage capability a
good operating system iPhone didn't even
launch with applications yet I guess
it's just looking back at the history
razor because of sales and iPhone
because now like the most popular
smartphone in America now well used to
be uh I think the set 50/50
pocketable clad in all the colors of the
rainbow the bigger manufacturers keep
frustratingly shying further away from
it's no makes sense because people I
mean wow it's a nice pink flip phone
congratulations you get like three
people one Instagram influencer to buy
it to call the new Razer two phones in
one that was neat how the clock change
from 1234 to
1235 a high-end Android Flagship and a
tiny called the new Razer phones in one
a
high-end 1228 okay wait he went back in
time Android Flagship and a tiny
minimalist phone blended into a single
foldable that reminds us that oh right
technology can be should be
fun I'm Michael fiser this is the 2024
Razer and Razer plus let's look at the
applications that we have here we have
uh got Google Gemini which my clochers
having over voice Telegram and Camera
and they are the antidote to every other
phone well I mean let's look at the
other phones that he has here they plus
and they are the antidote to every wait
let's see the comments here true not a
lot of women will buy pink phones not
true a lot of oh not too a lot of women
white pink phones would it be enough to
sustain having that color choice though
I mean maybe it will seem like a lot of
people but the most popular phone caller
in
America all over is is
black other phone and let's here we got
the pixel phone it says UND devised gim
Nano which is interesting more
interesting than say online gim we got
the iPhones which okay and then we got
s24 Ultra here SP
[Music]
pit that might seem like a lot of
bombast for a pair of products that look
a lot like last year's but it's that
very consistency that makes the cheaper
of these so exciting yeah $4.99 for
foring phone is really interesting yeah
it's
black I'm going to start with that more
affordable model which I will call the
minus but even if you're just here for
the plus stay with me because a lot of
these features are shared across
tiers whereas $700 in 2023 got you a
razor that you had to open to use this
year the same price gets you well
basically like last year's Flagship
Motorola took the 3.6 in cover screen
that's interesting that they did that
now some people try to sell this tiny
little screen and be like it's a it's a
minimalism feature which as you guys
know I despise minimalism in cell phones
like you know companies to try to rip
you off like the lightone 799 uh it's
399 now but when the reaload is come out
$799 with no internet access maybe a
music app and oh a color screen with GPS
on the eink version of The Light phone
of that just on eink display for 399
cies to try to rip you off by selling no
internet as a quote unquote feature that
I I don't get that
right at least Motorola and Samsung
didn't say a tiny screen is actually a
feature that's what the reviewers said
like that's not a feature that you have
to wear out the hinge more that's not a
feature also wow look at all this wasted
space What are you going to do like
drive a Hot Wheel over it from the old
razor plus and stuck it into a new
casing with a hinge that's 30% smaller
and you can actually see see that to be
noticeable it would be interesting if
they had and this probably happen like a
tiny display in here the time or like a
favorite quote you know like they have
on some of those gaming phones like the
little screen it's EAS to pick up a
phone then to check a notification than
putting a tiny screen on
outside yeah but then you'd have to
unfold it if you didn't have a screen on
there
and also quick selfies and
pictures and people like to use the
screen
for um say like you're recording
something or taking a picture of
something sorry some of the people want
to see what they look like like a
mirror uh before they take the
picture so it does have some useful
features that um Regular slab phones
don't have unfortunately I still haven't
seen a US based a US
folding
phone come with an optical zoom camera
like it can't be that hard like I know
it takes a lot of work but even the
Galaxy S9 right plus from
2018 oh yeah the older 2in screen it's
basically a piece of junk like you get
more screen real estate and definitely
more screen div body ratio on a
smartwatch than you would on on that
phone
its mechanical action is also much
smoother than the lumpy hinge of last
year making I said you can flip it and I
do believe that you can flip snap it
shut easier to open one-handed and
better able to maintain specific
postures like the new desk
pose let me think about that that looks
like a good aspect ratio for watching
YouTube if you don't want to comment or
anything um you can like pop it up that
looks good also looks like a good aspect
ratio for video calls maybe um if it
supports that it doesn't look like a
good aspect ratio for and for some
reason I don't know why but at least
where Samsung markets folding phones
they Market it to oh teenages jumping
around playing watching Tik Tock videos
and filming stuff yeah that post that's
cool like I don't know why they Samsung
least markets their phones like that
as in like wo it's for creators and and
and it it's it's the fun cool phone I
don't know why because unfortunately
here in the United States Samsung is not
and will never be the cool phone that's
the iPhone if I handed a kid said hey
you can need have this I mean something
like the folding aesthetic is cool but
two years from now wow the phone folds
you've been able to do that since 2019
it's going to die out right if I had get
an iPhone 7 from 2016 right now so you
can have a Galaxy Z flip
6 yeah I do that on my phone all the
time just it doesn't fold because I have
a
Ultra uh this is your hand a kid a
Galaxy Z flip 6 and the iPhone 7 plus
right they'll be like well this one has
iMessage so I'm going to take that even
though the Galaxy Z flip 6 is more
powerful it's better and more fully
featured I don't know why they're
marketing it to
teenagers neat I don't know why they're
marking it to teenagers and influencers
and creators as the quote unquote cool
phone and have all these kids doing
dance moves with
uh with uh T Tik Tock daners and
whatever no no one's doing that in real
life sorry it's it's not happening um
like even their own influences except
for Sydney swy Sweeney whatever her name
is uh who was at the Samsung event who
actually uses the Galaxy
Z flip 5 um according to
research um they don't they don't even
use the Samsung phone in their own
personal time so Samsung and M come of
better advertising strategy um speaking
of you have the s24 ultra how was your
battery life I like to hear about that
that hinge is common to both models by
the way now last year some of those edge
cases like Des pose felt like glorified
hacks but Motorola has polished them oh
this is awesome nice this is like what
they do for the laptops you know how
sometimes they sell like my laptop's a
two in one so you can flip it and tune
it and stuff like that as it leans
harder into its cover screen Advantage
unlocking a ton of customization options
actually maybe too many both new razors
also get a revised set of home screens
with quick shortcuts more widget panels
and the overdue always on display oh
that's nice it's it's also interesting
how this one has more bezel space up
here um than this one I guess this is
the more expensive model would be
interesting if they made the hinges a
bit large larger and on traditional
style flip phones you know that don't
like an actual flip phone the keypad at
the bottom the Camas are usually like
towards the center it'd be interesting
if they put the cameras towards the
center because you know on real cameras
the lens is always towards the center my
webcam is towards the center on my
laptop's webcam is towards the center
these cam cameras are n towards the top
it' be interesting to see if they bring
cameras back towards the S
now crucially you can still run that on
to life you want on the cover screen for
those cases where opening the phone is
Impractical or you're trying to cut back
on Doom scrolling or you just want to
save on battery practical or you're
trying to cut back on this say hooking
Bill well Doom scrolling or you just
want to save on battery since a smaller
screen equals a smaller power draw
which which sounds neat I like to see it
does look like it is possible to use
your phone like this all day um
especially this reminds me of say older
Blackberry that had the really wide
screen of course there's no keyboard
here physical keyboard but I like to see
what a day in the life of using this
cover screen all day would look like uh
maybe on the pro model or plus model
because the screen still looks a bit too
small um use with the keyboard say
you're sending an email or texting
someone but if you had to EXT space
there and had a really small keyboard I
like to see what that looks like how
much battery life you could work out by
just using the cover display that be
really interesting
test for those apps that don't like
landscape you can now rotate the phone
to run them on their side more on this
when we get to the plus but it's um for
some reason Instagram I have the beta
version or whatever crashes on my on my
phone encouraging to see Motorola
continue to democratize foldables this
robust a feature set available at $699
makes it much harder to recommend any of
those budget flip phones that started
appearing earlier this
year yeah also those phones aren't sold
curious ston so I've never seen that in
my life and just be sure you're happy
with the feature set being promised at
purchase if you always want your phone
to have the latest build of Android a
razor is not going to be your ride
Samsung updated its flip phones to
Android 14 in December and Oppo did the
same in April but as this video hits the
feeds last year's razors still languish
on Android 13 that is sad but it is good
that the security patch is a little bit
up to date I guess it motorol still
promises three platform updates over the
product lifetime just don't expect them
to arrive
promptly that's one thing I'm really
excited for my s24 ultra really excited
I'm going to get be one of the first in
line with
updates anyway the new ones do come with
Android 14 freshened up by Motorola's
custom
ux before not like off of Wu but I've
used it at stores on the lock screen are
more than indicators you can tap them to
preview your messages the gestures that
let you twist into the camera and that's
neat I guess
though it's a security nightmare
speaking of security I do like that
since it's the Moller it does have
separate user
profiles separate user profiles I really
want that on my phone I get a guest mode
I have to use some stupid little
uh like uh what do they call Kiosk app
on here that only works for 14 days and
I have to rein my get a new
account H I guess but
you but at the speed that they're going
to be on 15 they'll be they'll still be
on 13 when 15 comes out and I like to
get the latest updates on my device just
you know for security and also sometimes
you bring new features especially now ai
um they might be bringing in some new
features like
that chopped to the flashlight are as
handy as ever and now the phones wake up
when you reach for them in a flashback
to one of my favorite features from the
decade old Moto X that is a neat feature
that magic wand I guess when you're on a
phone call the cover screen doesn't just
show the Motorola logo that Insignia
keeps its orientation Rel relative to
the
ground that's interesting I'd like to
see if you can customize it maybe terms
of like a Batman logo or the techboy
logo or like the CIA spy logo or turn it
off to save battery when you're playing
a song or a podcast you've got fun
options for how you want that playback
visualized which takes me right back to
the days of Winamp someone had a lot of
fun with this stuff and it really whips
the
llama and now the cover screen still has
room for impr that looks good I like to
see some more of that in kles because
one thing that Samsung has is a lot a
lot and lots of features but I don't see
them in commcial I have to go find them
myself like that's fine it's my job I'm
a tech blocker it's it's my job to go in
find features and tell people about them
that's I make money but I would like
Samsung to show more features than wow
you can game on this phone you can chat
this phone has Instagram yeah so does
the a15 what else can it do Improvement
it takes a bit to learn to navigate
because it doesn't quite mirror the
standard Android layout and there's
probably one layer too many between the
always on screen the Sleep screen the
lock screen and the home screen also
there are occasional stutters that new
media controller is very laggy because
of the very old like no curved edges
looks more like a 2015 esque Android
lollipop kind of feel way Android works
the browser media
player on the cover doesn't mirror the
one on the main display but once you get
the hang of it it's amazing how often
you don't have to open the phone
ultimately Motorola has built a really
good mini phone I wonder how many Hoots
is also on to 60 into the front of its
foldable it seems to me that its task
for the next one will be to make it a
great one hopefully we'll see some
tweaks when the anticipated end of
summer update lands with Moto AI
features in tow stay tuned to see if
this flavor of AI is actually worth the
hype person I like to see what Motorola
has uh for AI I really haven't seen
though I'm not holding my
breath all that is of course only more
true on the flagship Razer plus which
deletes the forehead bezel to achieve a
full 4in cover screen I mean if you
think about it 4 in is the length or was
the length of iPhone 5 I think just a
different aspect ratio operationally
this doesn't make much difference
everything works pretty much the same as
it does in the minus but it certainly
does a good job of visually
distinguishing the more expensive model
so to do the color and finish options
while the cover is comes in green just
like the phone that uh Liz wanted way
back in 2004 victus Motorola wisely
avoided glass on the back plate this
year instead offering a mix of imitation
leather suede and even felt like finish
that's nice I like I was saying I think
we should bring L back to phones uh
again depending on color and trim for
the plus you've got spring green you got
midnight blue with the racing stripe
Motorola's partnership with Pantone
means peach fuzz is still around and to
celebrate I'd also like to see what kind
of cases they have to I think I've seen
the case I just would like to see them
again the 20th anniversary of the Razer
hot pink has made its triumphant return
alongside Paris Hilton who helped make
it famous way back when I was able to
get some footage of that was she
the was she the lady hood that t said
kit Ked original influencer on my own
hot pink review sample at Motorola's
launch event here in Brooklyn but before
we get to the cameras I do want to talk
about something more crucial
reliability I broke my Razer 2023 review
unit by accidentally dropping it while
it was open that looks awful hopefully
it has video out mode if this happens
with like a real consumer so they can
get their data
off I'd like to see that because it
would be really nice if you could plug
that in have a nice little popup
computer
type that was my fault but the
replacement sample Motorola was kind
enough to send me developed a crack on
its screen protector after 7 months of
use a pretty common issue reported on
the Razer
subreddit well back in March I took the
opportunity to see what it might be like
to get that razor repaired I called
Motorola posing as a normal customer and
its support team set up an appointment
for me at my local U braak iix well when
I arrived they had no idea what I was
talking about the fact that given the
current state of customer service for
literally anything in 2024 I was of
course expecting they eventually found
me in the system but it turns out
motorol had made the wrong type of
reservation which means ere I fix had
never ordered the replacement screen
protector DK would need for the repair
since it doesn't keep them in stock and
that's obviously not ideal and frankly I
don't that's not ideal but of course it
makes sense because you
know 3% of the population own
pixels maybe one will
have expect the repair process to get
any smoother for foldables until
companies really make a genuine effort
in this regard but there is a small poop
that says we're only doing fbl from now
on maybe Samsung though photography
still isn't as good on foldables as it
is on slabs and photography is a main
selling point on their phones also s pin
definitely not Apple it could be
Motorola they can say we're only doing
foldable flagships from now on obviously
Motorola makes the most of their money
from budget phones and not going to make
$200 fold on
phones so maybe more maybe Samsung
lining Motorola says its hinge redesign
should quote virtually eliminate
cracking or peeling of the display by
allowing for an improved bending radius
to reduce stress when folding i' like to
test that maybe come back to the video
uh seven months after additionally a
floating hinge plate under the display
ensures minimal creasing of the screen
even with extended use unquote also the
Razer screen protector is new for both
models this year with a design that no
longer includes a notch for the selfie
shooter removing the temp neat tempation
to peel it
off would like to see how it affects
selfie C CA performance though this
phone would hypothetically take the best
selfies because you can use the dual
cameras on the front to take the front
facing
photos the other big change to the razor
plus is also my least favorite we'll
hang with Paris watch some sunsets and
eat some hot dogs all courtesy of these
very different cameras but first let P
for 2 weeks I took both razors
everywhere the m was my companion for a
New Jersey road trip that heavily taxed
its 4200 Mah hour battery with 4200
that's that's okay I would like to see
maybe 4 4,500 5,000 milliamp battery um
let's see s22 plus is like 4,700 so 4200
that's that's okay hours of turn-by-turn
directions culminating in the reason I
kicked off this video with a couple of
Bourdain quotes I visited his favorite
hot dog joint hyams where I learned
three things first deep frying is the
absolute best way to cook a hot dog you
can deep fry hot dogs can't believe it
took me 41 years on this planet to learn
that he's
41 second due to the difference in
chipsets the minus can't keep a preview
on the cover screen if you're shooting
video in
4k that's okay that seems fine um I
guess 4K is for stealth videos well the
plus
can it's nice to see what your
processing power is going to at least
like you don't really
see increases in performance visibly
anymore I would say
third when you are as close to the
traffic as you are willing to
get but you still I'm trying to get a
pretty okay shot well that's when it's
useful to have Ultra
wide bummer
yeah while the more affordable Razer
retains the wide-angle secondary camera
the Razer plus swapped that ultrawide
for a telephoto and as you guys know I
really got into technology to you know
advention Odyssey episodes and
spying so I for one actually like the
inclusion of a telephoto because it's
you know better Zoom I would like to see
wide angle cameras get some more love
like we already seeing these 50
megapixel main cameras and that's neat
that's good for Zoom or whatever but
s24 series like it has a 12 megapixel or
10 megapixel whatever wide camera I
would like to see maybe a 50 megapixel
wide angle camera so you can oh a 50
megapixel wide angle camera so that when
you zoom into one two three it still
looks good but you could get a nice
white shot so basically a triple camera
system in one in two
cameras T insult to injury a dinky 2x
lens meant not to add any true reach but
to cater to people who take a lot of
portrait photos I mean too two times is
still pretty good in in my opinion uh at
least back in 2018 2019 that's when
those You' see those type of Shooters a
demographic Motorola's data tells It is
Well represented in the Razer customer
base makes
sense now while that's probably true I
still hate this decision again the
razors came with me
everywhere to a dive bar in Red Hook
whose door I've been meaning to darken
for over a year on a quick overnight to
my ancestral Homeland out in the country
on Eastern Long
Island and for the kind of diverse photo
opportunities only New York City can
give you uh AP here
looks like that is I'd like to see what
I could do on a more powerful battery F
the kind that find you rushing for a
train at Grand Central in the morning
attending a launch party for Verizon's
new branding in the East Village in the
afternoon H that's interesting and
nursing a cold beer back in Brooklyn
while watching the sunet behind the
Statue of Liberty that evening and in
each of those situations that looks nice
I found the ultra wide camera that Ultra
wide I mean it is totally blowing out
the Sun the Statue of Liberty looks like
a
stick the Razer minus was or would have
been more useful meanwhile the 2x
telephoto of the Razer plus gave
marginal if any benefits to the zoom at
least you can see you can make out the
you know the head and
the the
arm shots that I take far more often
than
portraits now just as noticeable and I
think even more interesting color
accuracy look at yellow brown I'm going
to say that the Brown's more accurate
but I could be wrong is the profoundly
different way these cameras see the
world the Razer is powered by a
mediatech 7300 X while the Razer plus
runs on a Snapdragon 8s gen 3 from
Qualcomm oh okay so it's like the
powerful light chip in day-to-day
operation that doesn't make much
difference aside from slightly slower
app opening and Camera switching times
on the minus but image processing is
another story and Camera switching times
on the minus but which oneide from
slightly slower app opening and Camera
switching time times on the minus I
guess so but image processing is another
story
entirely often I prefer the harsher more
opinionated contrast of the plus even
though it tends to crush the Shadows
interesting um though of course you
could edit that in light Loom or
whatever I really would like to see a
full photo editor like Photoshop come to
Android I try it using kitra but
it's the minus also imparts a tiny bit
of that 2012 era Instagram fa HDR
aesthetic but these results aren't
consistent I I don't know I didn't have
or use or know what Instagram was in
2012 so I don't know what that f h
sometimes the phones defy their usual
Trends and it's the minus giving more
contrast yeah I've been noticing that in
the images like here you got the I
actually like this image better you can
see you know the stars in the flag and
nice and bright though these colors
might be more accurate it's more like
maybe you could do like an over
and you get the perfect I prefer the
added drama the razor minus is higher
saturation brings to the shot yeah you
can even read just says it says
Metropolitan Transportation Authority I
mean I can read that but some other
people may not be able to at least at
certain Zoom settings punch back out to
the wide angle of Grand Central and I go
back to per see what I mean the wide is
that doesn't you can barely make it out
is it 8 megapixels the plus sometimes
it's the the plus that does a better job
of evoking the saturated colors of
summertime and sometimes it's the minus
I I think you get it yeah so it doesn't
seem like Moda or Samsung for that
instance really cares about the cameras
on their phone affordable phones I
really like would wish that would be
better but that's all for now God bless
