<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 32225</h1>
<pre>hello everybody Welcome to to this week
in the Tech booy podcast we have so much
to talk about today we put published and
pushed out three new articles today and
yes we are Live on YouTube so that is
good so we published out three new this
week uh the the tech booy um themed
articles we also pushed out um a new SS
ltw article as well um so we're going to
get into that um and there's also a
whole bunch of things going on online so
but first let's go over to what's
happening on the tech boy.org um because
we have three headlines that's happened
here today most relevant one being um
perplexity is now ready for March
Madness the basketball tournament that
is going on so as you can see on the
screen perplexity um the artificial
intelligence application I've had as my
uh default assistant alongside Bixby on
my phone for a full week um now on as
you can see on the screen it says March
Madness is here view the latest bracket
in they released this new tool just in
time for March Madness who will show you
the live brackets as of today so I'm
actually on my phone I'm looking at it
on the screen right here it opens up in
the link um but it does give you some um
interesting tidbits so aside from giving
you the bracket of which teams won and
the scores it also gives you percentages
of what team it thinks is going to win
for instance as of now live um number
four Texas A&M is beating uh number five
Michigan 48 to39 and it believes that
Texas A&M has an 81% chance of victory
will update you on that see if they win
or not um it also gives a percentage
updates on who things going to win on
non-li games as well of number two
Michigan uh MSU I think it's Michigan
State University versus uh NM New Mexico
uh it believes that number two New
Mexico is going to win
uh with a 73% chance and then also gives
me a uh a tiny graph here so um New
Mexico had about over % chance at 7% of
time um the Spartans did drop down into
the 30s um but now they've leveled back
out to a 73% chance of Victory it also
can upload your bracket and it will
roast it so I'm actually going to check
to see if we have any comments here and
you guys can tell me who you had on your
bracket we'll do a live roasting right
here on air so let me go check the
comments um let's see if there any uh
YouTube comments that come in yet no
okay so um I'm just going to go find
some
random more Madness
bracket and it will allow you
to upload so I'm TR to
see let me let me see if I can find
one that's been
made no brackets yet so I have to go
find my own bracket so while I'm going
to go find that bracket let's um go
switch back over to DET tech.org
hopefully you still can see this on the
screen um we also pushed out another
article hope you also like our new logo
um like I said we're going to be trying
to keep the orange theme here this does
have a nice gradient I do like the
gradients here speaking of gradients and
everything um shout out to Christy
leemon C did find all of the uh hidden
Easter eggs in our logo here you can
even see one of the Easter eggs right
there in the circle there so here's the
first user confirmed to find all the
Easter eggs in our thing all right
remote desktop um to our personal
computer so um I was playing around with
the remote desktop application on my
phone um and it was really really
interesting um however I was having a
really hard time trying to figure out
how you can connect to remote desktop
application if you don't have say a
domained username or anything of that
nature so if you are just a regular user
who just needs to learn how to who needs
use a phone uh and connect your computer
to your phone here's how you're going to
do it so make sure the remote desktop is
enabled on your PC unfortunately you
know if you're not using XPO 7 or
whatever um you have to have the pro
version of Windows so
um yeah uh you have to have the pro
version of Windows so I have the pro
version of Windows 11 you have to also
have the pro version Windows 10 you also
have to have admin access uh you know
you have to have all your user right
things so those are just the
prerequisites um you guys can go check
that in so here's the three simple steps
to to do it first you have to type in
windows keyr open CMD then type who am i
w h o a m m i I'm into there and you'll
see your desktop username right so you
see whatever your desktop username SL
John for instance my username is you
know my username on my computer slash uh
X360 because that's what the laptop is a
coded is it's a HP nvx360 and you want
you do you type in that username and
you'll type in your computer local user
password this is for local users not
Microsoft account sorry you type in your
computer local user password into the
RDP um at and you'll be connected of
course make sure you are on the same uh
local network as where I didn't test it
across like use my phone on mobile data
have my phone over on the local network
all right so that that's a bit of
networking tip for today also special
thanks to grock for helping us write
this article and before we dive into our
Evangelical ISM um keys for kid radio is
back on alexas uh unfortunately Google
is now having a problem with so you know
at least it's back on Alexa and that's
great congratulations to Kit radio um
it's it's it's back it went offline in
October we covered that because they
changed their streaming providers so
unfortunately you know as an internet
radio station I mean that's kind of
their think right they have to be
accessible over all Alexa no no one's
really going to be listening um to them
as much but now it's back you guys can
go ask Alexa to listen to it now and now
we're going to talk about Keys for Kids
radio's parent Ministry uh no the AUD a
drama's parent Ministry that makes keys
for kids radio the Audio Drama down gide
Lane which it it's once again because
you have these stupid people and this is
going to enti Broad into a cultural
issue that's happening right now it's
these stupid people that always ruin
everything for the best of us but you
know I'm actually going to have to stick
up for a team kid like I always do like
I talked about um two weeks ago maybe
three weeks ago yeah on March 1 when I
was talking about you know uh allowing
kids to be on Discord and uh Snapchat
and whatnot cuz you guys know um this it
is a time of recording uh March 22nd so
um one year ago subtract 8 days off of
that so uh
350 265 no actually was a leap here so
add X thing nine days I mean sorry
subtract seven
days so
356 days ago you know we got kicked off
of NTB so you know always going to be
advocating for the kids to be um you
know allowed to use uh the internet and
technology and stuff like that and not
have stupid people
um you know mess it up for the rest of
them and nonetheless nonetheless right
we we can have a whole recap of kids
like weilan episode uh next next podcast
episode as would be you know continuous
over the anniversary of that thing
whatever anyway what the the point the
point of this is is that ke for radio uh
Down K Lane ran this Audio Drama called
Down K lane from like 2000 to like 2012
or something like that oh no sorry 2009
so I'm going to assume that this episode
this is right after that you know the
the Haley episode uh where they go I
mean the lady is literally using a
cassette tape to listen to a pathway to
Purity so I'm not sure when uh path
Pathway to Purity stopped making them in
cassette tapes but I know that V NY
stopped making cassette tapes back in
like 2006 so let's just say it's around
that time period say it's like 2004
anyway the main Brooke Morrison wants to
start a blog for her missionary thing
here and she's like oh I'm going to
start a blog right this is great and
then of course John Morrison who knows
has no idea what a Blog is this is the
father he like oh what's the block oh
it's like an interet internet thing they
do the whole what it stands for y cuz
you know probably because you know most
listeners probably won't know what it is
anyway and then he got launches into
this entire all well you know the people
on the internet you know it's dangerous
it's a big world out there people the
internet unsafe spot whoa I'm sorry are
you right sure yes kind of okay you
might be laying it on a little bit okay
yes I know this is uh Christian radio
and that was that was a thing back in
like 2004 or we get into that where you
were just going to the internet is a big
thing guys it's it's big it's not it's
it's it's dangerous you know make sure y
y y yes we get it we we all got it
people okay we we we got it you didn't
know what a Blog was until two minutes
ago and now you're just launching into
lectures on this I mean the even worst
thing of this is this is actual kidon
episode and is a really really old Kon
episode probably around the same time
period where apparently the monitor
that' be Lucille Lucille's sister
Lucille's mom and dad all right the
monitor family is uh getting highspeed
email okay they literally got she
literally got emailed that's the entire
premise of the uh uh of the episode so
py probably got got you know a 5 56
kilobyte modem instead of like a 23
kilobyte modem on her dialup hex maybe
you can got dialup uh not dialup DSL
maybe even satellite internet so she got
this real highspeed email here the
entire perment of the episode is oh well
you know she spent way too much time on
her email uh that she wasn't able to get
her reports for uh school and for some
reason the student newspaper not the
student newspaper the actual newspaper
in the town is hiring fifth graders B
fifth grader lizards to write for
like yeah yeah see yeah that's why you
know high speed and that bad or like Liz
this is another episode where Liz goes
on and just like steals his mom credit
card to buy something to get something
for free to get a boom box or something
and then they have to move his
computer I mean but I I'm sorry but like
just don't be stupid I mean there's so
many stupid people out there they're all
going to mess this mess these things up
and uh freaking you know even iCal
Christian radio programs are going to
have is thinking all these kids are just
running around out here you know being
stupid you know downloading marware off
the internet and just like spending time
on their highspeed internet you know
emailing the day away and not getting
any work done
which I mean your program literally
features talking lizards so and that
we're just going to doubt the veracity
of those claims there um so yeah yeah
yeah just just just know okay just know
but you know when we talk about internet
stupidity we have so much so much that
that that is going on here like like I
said you know there these people like
like the scams or whatever like I said I
I really cannot feel compassion for you
when you when you have said scam if you
if you're getting scammed into sending
elicit photos of of yourself by some
random guy who's pretending to be a girl
uh uh yeah
the Bro Look everyone knows about the
scam and you're just sending illicit
photos that doesn't make any sense just
just why wh why why would anyone send
uh is it photos to anyone like first of
all who wants to see that and second of
all why why would you send them you know
there's this easy easy way to prevent
illicit photos from being Spread spread
around that would be all right are you
ready for this guys to not take the them
and not to have them and you can't have
a leak who would have thought stupid
people like this is going to cause to
advis and more you know Audio Drama
telling us like this and then you're
going to have people like trying to ban
you know cell phones uh in in in in
school that's just ridiculous it's not
that's not going to work in fact here is
I'm going to um pull up another image
here this
says um we're not going to tune it on
the image we're not going to we don't we
don't need to show up audio um but here
is we're just going to show a video clip
here with the caption from a user called
unusual Wells here and this person uh is
a news reporter quote breaking Robert
Kennedy Jr says he will get cell phones
out of school quote cell phones produce
Electric magnetic radiation which has
been shown to do neurological damage to
kids when it's around them all day
what no no that that's not how this
works you can see our whole episode
about those stupid stickers you stick it
on the back of the phone you get scammed
out of $500 have like 6,000 per profit
margins no that that's not how this
works you the electronic radiation from
a cell phone and a bag in school doesn't
going to mess with the no no that's not
how this works second of all like I said
always try to keep them in school just
have them in the Hamp in in the hampers
I think Huckabee is wrong on this but
just have them in the hampers during
class time let them be during lunch time
okay and so should we ban them for you
know social reasons or no should we ban
them for totally made up electromagnetic
brain control novacom 2001 ES reasons no
okay look no no no one that should be uh
that that Leeves this kind of junk
should be you know heading up anything
uh important okay they shouldn't even be
allowed on student council but back to
the elicit photos thing there was this
viral image Trend thing that's going
around here that was apparently from
four years ago on a website called uh
forchan now as you guys know forchan um
apparently got a uh weapon to launch for
them so they did some ENT and got some
woman to uh they got some woman to uh
launch
a missile on some side or something not
a woman it was a man sorry but any this
this this image here let's fly in here
see this image here people going around
yapping saying that the woman in the
brown was fat or something um apparently
this is a scup okay it's it's apparently
a SC up okay I did some investigative
journalism this picture is from four
years ago and uh it's on posted to
multiple um you know non-illicit and
illicit websites um I did U one of those
you know reverse image searches here and
as you can see here on uh this is a
dress form on right here from four years
ago so this is from at least 2021 maybe
even 2020 um and these people um this as
you can see in the time stamp here it's
posted on 410
20203 as you can see it says quote my
great GF girlfriend has a pouch uh like
pick and it doesn't seem to go away no
matter how hard she hits the gym is sery
my only hope um all right
so I did some like I I tried to do some
BMI calculations here
um but unfortunately no one knows
anything about these people it's just a
it's it's it's a fake and like I said
this is probably a fake story that's
being pushed uh that's being pushed
around cuz people like roasted them over
the Internet cuz uh on internet for this
it's a fake story that's being pushed
around also you know we all no this a
fake story because he says my girlfriend
has a p likee pick it's against the
terms of service for anyone on foran to
have a girlfriend okay it's just that's
that's not how that works anyway this
image is from four years ago and he's
just like apparently famous and just
keeps recirculating the internet from
now on so it's just a really really big
SC up that's been going around as well
all right speaking of
scups and I I I I assure you we're going
to get back to our a story
about uh elicit photographs in 2004
esque down gillot Lane episodes in uh
2004 highs speeed internet uh uh
highspeed internet email um and this all
ties in um somehow some way okay I
assure you that this ties in somehow
some way what y next thing on the thing
oh yes yes yes here here's another
internet uh Trend as well let me find
um Let me let me see if I can find
it and actually I actually use
perplexity to help um me on this one as
well so all the stats IED if it's if
it's wrong go blame uh perplexity um if
it's right then blame me for uh it it's
being correct all right so apparently uh
there's there two competing narratives
we've talked about one of these things
before uh the theory of hot girl summer
we haven't talked about white boy some I
have no idea what that is but uh it's a
thing it's it's a thing here and um in
this war what do you guys think is going
to happen quote in the hypothetical race
between white boy summer don't know what
it is versus hot girl summer you can go
check out our channel to find out what
that is Crush Theory comes into play
because while Bo have a vastly majority
uh has has the vast sorry majority of
the numerical Advantage it comes in at 8
Mill uh it comes in at 8.5 million white
milles AG 18 to 25 United States um
versus and this is according to
perplexity so uh blame perplexity if
this wrong versus 350,000 H girls eight
through 10 a 18 to 25 in the United
States of America now I don't know what
they're supposed to be competing on but
I mean it apparently obviously seems
that uh you know the white boys um
should win I mean they outnumber them um
let's turn the perlex here let's see how
fast it can do math um 8.5 million
divided by
350,000 dang I could have turned on this
l oh here we go they outnumbered him
about one to 24 so uh you know that's
Crush theory is really really working
well that day I'm going to give this one
uh to uh the white boys for white boy
suu um they can go fly their flag or
whatever they do for uh white boy suu um
I I don't really know what that is all
right um speaking of the United States
of America we have Samsung
which Samsung what are you doing okay
Samsung released an advertisement
advertising the new Galaxy watch and the
Samsung Galaxy s25 Ultra and um
apparently no one noticed this
but uh we we we live in the United
States of America okay so um I'm going
to show this ad to you if it if it
decides to load hopefully today we don't
need the audio on this one
either all
right so this is from the official
Samsung YouTube channel and this is an
official advertisement that they made um
themselves so let me see if I can find
oh my gosh I'm GNA have to switch to
Edge that's how bad this is so it's it's
a new ad I saw this on TV I was utterly
shocked by what I saw I mean it it was
it was just wrong okay it was just
wrong all right here is the Samsung
advertisement um for the Galaxy s25
Ultra where is it
where'd they
go did they delete the commercial okay
okay it should be in my YouTube history
so let me go pull that up um hopefully
uh I also left a comment on the video so
hopefully they didn't uh delete the
video cuz that' be really really sad but
you it would be good cuz that means I
accomplished my job I did get some
screens so if if
um if first comes to wor we can see
your we can see the uh we can see the
screen
shots oh no no I found
it it's a 36 second commercial so we can
just watch the whole thing and then um
you know you
know well we we'll we'll see we'll see
about it see if you guys notice the
problem in this Samsung
commercial all right so he has his
Galaxy watch he has his s25 Ultra here
the now beef unfortunately not coming to
some of the other devices officially we
got some of the things here nice sleep
energy score here we got him checking
the wether got him checking the the the
rain there he lives in San Francisco
it's a bit windy and he's going outside
you know he has his jogging pants on he
has his
uh uh things on right there all right
that's great
commercial wait wait what did we say we
said it was
24°
24° yeah okay okay okay this is it's 24
degrees outside that's fine he has to go
on his morning run let's see how he's
dressed whoa no one in uh San Francisco
address us like this when it's uh almost
10° below
freezing look at these people in the
background
here do does it look like it's 10
degrees below freezing here no no which
means I put this in Celsius Samsung this
is the United States of America we use
Freedom Units we use Fahrenheit okay and
um if we put this into uh Celsius that'
be 25 I mean sorry 24 * 95th
okay plus
32 wait is this
right it's at 75.2 degrees let make sure
I did this
right 24+
9 yes I just wait may be 75 degrees
Samsung why is your noun brief in
Celsius
I mean come on come on Samsung you're
better than that his phone should know
that he is in the United States let me
check that because it says San
Francisco on on San Francisco for his
morning
run what come
on this
just no no one no one saw this no no one
saw this okay
that's okay that's that's that's fine
that's fine that no one uh no no one
caught that no one saw that at all you
know maybe maybe if those people have
been monitoring their internet there and
not monitoring the internet of some
random lizard or whatever you know that
that that wouldn't have
happened all right let's see what else
is next on our agenda for today all
right J2 ammy
J2 and me is
a what cell phones used to
run before you know we had Android and
iOS we had j2m so and there there was a
j2m Bible actually I got interested in
looking into the history of you know
mobile Bible applications before the
Bible app and unfortunately um I was not
able to get it to work on my phone here
I have a j2m emulator on here so this is
what some phones ran as well like that
Motorola Razor um of the flip phones as
well so when people are talking about
like oh we didn't have apps growing up
well yeah I guess you just didn't
download any but there were plenty and
plenty apps I'm growing up as well in
fact I have a file folder of over 5,000
j2m applications or games on my uh on on
my phone right here um I guess these are
archived um here they're not that
they're not that good but uh you know
they're playable
and in fact um I'm going to open up one
of them as well
over
over 5,000 mobile games all right and
opens up these games you have 1850
friends in by 19402 2004 real football
soccer um
uh absolute puzzle ACO xit gifts uh
aquaus action basketball that looks
interesting and there's this um emulator
called J2 emulator on the Play Store
that let you emulate these things so I
found the Bible file um this application
was developed a long time ago like over
20 years ago and unfortunately it
wouldn't run I went to go download these
games to go see if they worked but and
they did in fact there's some of these
games this one worked for the Nokia 700
something here you can see these games
are like kind of low pixel something
uh and in fact let's see let's see
what all right all right I'm trying to
start one uh here as well it's like a
basketball game so when people tell you
that their smartphones didn't uh that
their flip phones didn't have any games
or any apps and that they grew up in a
simpler time a better time that their
phone was only for calls and texts no
that's not true J2 and me was extremely
prevalent
uh force in in uh mobile technology even
for the very very overrated MOBA uh
razor um the original like from 200
overrated phone okay everyone's like oh
it's so nice oh it's so it's so so thin
which is what uh you know people yapping
about you know with those women on the
internet unfortunate right oh thinness
it's all a hooks right the mot Ras the M
Ras V3 was such bad phones even for 2004
like I said smartphones existed right um
for for uh instance in 2006 the Nokia
n95 came out right and it was Miles
Ahead Miles Ahead better and there much
better symian phones than the Motorola
uh Razer the only reason it was popular
because had like a neat color and it was
it was know skinny right baely had
access to Internet which phones did have
back then in fact we just played a game
of basket ball on the j2m um ulator
phone here so this this would have been
a popular game amongst you know some
phones back then um and in fact this
probably was the type of phone that Liz
was using uh the phone that had J2 me
when he lost and could send a text on
there they could send uh games on it
because you know this must have been
like such an old episode that
um you know one of the main talking
points of the like best phones and there
was like a 3.5 in screen and uh a key a
keyboard and full access to the internet
look J2 and me was good the motor ra
was not just really wasn't that good
it's very very overrated and I I guess I
can say this now that one of the phones
on that I'm that I'm going to be testing
and I bought this phone right from you
know all the money that we've made from
Adra and all six cents of it um I bought
this phone and it's a motorer razor
clone and we're going to be testing it
out here has a 5 megapixel camera it's
running Android but it has the old Mota
razor body so it's going to be really
really interesting to see what this
phone can do all right on to the next um
thing Rumble yes look there's this thing
you know this video streaming platform
Rumble Canadian based
Rumble that you know everyone's like
flocking to because it's like anti-
censorship anti YouTube yada yada yada
and apparently I guess we don't support
you know American based alphabet in
Google anymore but you know
Rumble I'm I'm sorry it's trash Rumble
is trash like okay you're like oh and
it's always these websites too like you
know you know um you know lot of hate
them lot to be and twitch you have great
user interfaces for websit of thek right
the the other websites like that n y y
every talking about you know censorship
censorship censorship your websites are
trash okay I I've been to your websites
they don't look that good the GI is
terrible and this goes to rumble as well
rumble's developers look like they
developed this website in 2007 like yeah
yeah we'll just we'll just let this here
as as well there's nothing good on
Rumble and all the people who over here
yapping about you know Rumble and
uh you know all all these people over
here Ying about Rumble and stuff you
know I would switch to rumble if Rumble
was actually good if people actually
used you know Rumble in fact yes there
are other streaming um platforms that
allow people like with some streamer and
that other streamer kais that other
stream he was in the bathtub of someone
side tangent here as I go find
my Rumble rant why just how do these
people get famous just for screaming and
T well I did have a rumble but uh you
know Rumble used to
be uh you know he used to import my
YouTube videos
automatically R
Rumble Rumble is garbage okay
Rumble and O how many engine that I
don't know the RO the graphics it's just
bad the graphics of Rumble are so
bad just we we will use Rumble when
Rumble doesn't have Graphics from 2007 I
don't care what kind of quote unquote
features and quote unquote uncensorship
and quote I don't care okay Rumble is is
is just trash okay and once it stops
being trash then people will use it and
that's the thing that people need to
learn
right we're not just going to use a
platform because it aligns to values
we're going to use a platform because it
you know it actually looks good and it's
easy to use love them I hate them hate
you hate YouTube all you want at least
YouTube has a nice slick uh G GUI that's
easy and accessible to
use
okay Rumble no okay no no no one no
one's using uh Rumble
all
right Harry
San Harry Harry
San has gotten himself into a bit of
trouble uncovered by Sarah fields and
you know you guys can go read her report
on that but this is thing like okay
essentially T he did on Snapchat
essentially um
sent elicit no he had elicit photos sent
to him under false premises um by like
12 11 different people and yes you know
it's different this time because you
know they actually talking to Harry
who's an
influencer who once again is proving me
right you know I said RZ is a threat to
National Security people like he no RZ
isn't a threat to National Security
you're just making stuff up you just
don't blah blah blah uhhuh well 6 months
ago Harry interviewed like the president
of the United States or something like
that and now he's in trouble for like a
Riz related incident so you know as is
proven right Riz can be used to fight um
and it's just like still why would you
send them ilicit photos who wants to
look at El listed photos I just I really
just don't get
it like can someone come to comeone
explain this to
me like are they victims yes sure but
like is he is he a scumbag
yes should people be sending elicit
photos like that that's a that's a thing
just just just don't don't do that right
when we have people like this and you
know idiot kids who us to do the same as
well in fact uh my National Security
advisor allegedly I was going through
some of the T tapes of this um did did
the same thing except you know he he was
actually the one making money off of it
so we get of the peoples allegedly I
listed photos and then people ask him
for him he'd send he'd get $20 allegedly
and he send those people to them
allegedly uh and you know that just goes
to show how far SSA is willing uh to
work uh with someone for the greater
good entitles and scaving I just why
just why you cannot have a leak if those
said photos don't exist you cannot you
know just
just just
don't okay that that that's my that's my
thing uh for today now um speaking of
National Security advisor and SS is
proven right you know that's probably
wet your appetite for our most recent uh
actually most recent to SS lt.
blogspot.com article so hope you guys
can see this on the screen this
is
our uh SSA the classified website I have
two more articles already on the docket
today so um you know we we are searching
through really really quickly cuz we're
trying to get back to you know writing
for the Odyssey boy as you can see this
is published March 22nd
2025 um we will probably be done by May
okay so you know story starts in
November 9th 2022 it's going to
end in oober of 24 or September 24 or
something like that all right let's see
oh actually we have three articles yeah
we're got to go through all the articles
that you haven't seen um I don't think
you've seen the summer files yeah cuz we
didn't we published this after the
podcast released on Saturday so we're
going to actually go through these in
depth on the Su of something seemed
weird something seemed off about G cam
that'ss so uh SSA is is going to be
investigating suu suu is one of the most
popular characters or you know prevalent
characters now on since he joined in
January um in in the Ser in series time
not in whatever like the time that I
wrote These articles but in in series
time this is what T join and something
soon something seemed off about gcam
that's s because s is for uh summer um
so we're going to be linking her back to
a new character that we uh well not a
new character but we've only talked to
him like once so March 2020 um then we
going to link who sorry what investigate
who linking who to David and then also
going to be investigating her linking
her
to what did I name Malachi all right in
20201 and we give a nice back long
backstory here talking about how s got
banned um talking about how um you know
the Nica investigation the Nica War um
the G
table and this is this is this is a real
interrogation thing that we have here
and essentially we go over all the
aspects we go over internet Espionage
with VPN talk about double agents I note
the speed of the answers I go over the
tapes in fact I have so many tapes um of
these right now I've actually imported
them from my phone Samsung voice
recorder um which you know I was so
excited when the Galaxy AI transcriber
came out cuz it was good but these are
like so noisy so background fill that
they're just not really that good and of
course you know my secret recording
device here I actually lost the tower
rack which I wouldn't need the secret
record if I had my tower wack but I was
able to get this one as well I cost like
$20 voice activated um Tac was a voice
act recorded that he have here so if
essentially the sum investigation go
through all of the Back stories of um
2020 2021 kind of like tying everything
to G and then we tie that to suu all
right this is this is real it's not just
a literary device that we've been you
know using here we actually believe that
suu had connections to uh liberally or
energized or whatever and
then because we also had reason to
believe this um as well maybe even some
ties to Damian as well cuz you know like
you know random kid shows up and then
you're just like running through the
woods 3 days later you know that's kind
of weird okay uh not not going to lie
here like you know when when you've had
over 100 days of not being chased
through the woods and then you know
random kid shows up and then you're
getting chased through the woods you
know it's stuff like that happens like
you know you know the battle of the
Goldfish you know throwing Hydro flasks
at people you know all all normal right
getting literally chased behind you know
the woods and having to send Coda
messages via walkie-talkie and text
message yeah no like uh when you're
hiding behind a bush um you know you you
kind of start thinking some interesting
things as well so then we go in and we
have some investigation here this is
from March oh wait no it's sry you
almost got to see the summer files uh
again wait what
happened wait wait a second did I post
the sum files
twice oh well maybe you did get to see
this and I'm going to have to delete
that article because it doesn't make
sense to have two Les under the same uh
name all right here we go op oh no it
must be glitch in the website for to
fire the code or whatever Mission
accomplice SS ltw
so this is the days before actually
we're going to have to go let's go back
let's go
back no my gosh you coded this website
anyway here's mission accomplish as you
can see here aan Shay is talking to the
Press with his SSA ltw uh from from the
SS ltw Podium SP their approaches I
start crunching my genius PR Lee and
jono um for uh those of you who don't
know catching up right you know we have
this investigation so we have the sumon
investigation we also have this Hazel
investigation that's going on this is
Hazel 2.0 not Hazel not Hazel one Hazel
2.0 um Lee and J one and two suspects
for someone who wrote Hazel's number on
of on on something you know actually
committing you know some vandalism or
something as well which again you know
it's kind of weird that you know we we
have the uptick cases after some random
kid just shows up in the middle in the
middle of the year not Jo did also
randomly show up and yes he's a Fel and
yes he did still a cause so you know
maybe we should have been pinning him to
um forign adversaries but you know uh
jono never attempted to invade gcam
actually much to sharen because you know
we actually wanted jono too invade gcam
you know s invaded gcam you know they
over at a house you know multiple times
uh John one ever ever invaded G cam even
though you know he had SSA assistant and
Ally ship in there as well all right
anyway which once again you know we W
going to be we actually get that to the
next episode here so I'm looking at the
eights you know I have a s22 plus back
here and I really really wanted like
Samsung Galaxy S 24 Ultra there cuz you
know I had to pull out the pin and had
someone trace the eights here as well
and then we have um you know I'm
analyzing eights I'm watching the
classrooms you know seeing who's coming
in and who's coming out right and we
ruled out a gcam collection for
targeting Hazel right you know Hazel and
gcam are kind of against each other
unfortunately like we've gone over
multiple multiple times is that the gcam
intelligence agency wasn't as good as
the uh you know SSA intelligence uh
agency right uh you like we like we've
already say SSA was coded for Espionage
and gcam was coded for like socialism
not like communism like like socialism
social gings etc
etc uh but and you know as say tried to
transform into socialism and TR
transform GK into intelligence uh
transformation into socialism did better
than gcam trans transformation into
intelligence in fact they do actually
try to go into intelligence scaling
doesn't go well for them uh at all okay
um I have that story written already and
it's just monkey noises I'm being made
okay that's a little thing in the uh
storyed history of the two-day uh the
the story two-day history of the gcam
and TI AG
so yeah not good anyway oh okay does
this mean Molly could be the one
targeting Hazel which doesn't really
make sense for a geopolitical
perspective because uh Molly and Addison
or not against Hazel right and you know
you know you know anyone who can draw
Hydro FL and get away with it probably
has a better in stency than gcam so he
probably knew that Molly was a bit more
Pro uh that ha was a bit more Pro jvn
anti- gcam Etc
so uh yada yada yada we have this uh you
know student council subplot story here
as well in fact we can see how gcam has
the Super majority in student council
which this is how you don't have too
much time on my hand here I am like
making a freaking map of uh gcam super
majority and student council here you
can see we have 11 people here and we
have gcam uh seven uh to jvn four so
here we go we have President Allison and
her political party in the pink and then
we have vice president Geneva and her
political party uh in green so across
the board Denver Maria closa E also look
at Denver over there all by himself all
by himself for Denver over in ninth
grade SSA back Denver all right Maria
Clarissa and Ava aa's crossed out so she
doesn't really count for this cuz you
know she left but uh whatever and then
we have a war who's that supposed to be
based on oh yeah yeah remember okay uh
then Amala Maria Clarissa that would be
the rest of gam and then we have Ean
that would be uh me and then Cody and
yeah that's it Mary Vera and
War all in the shadows U yeah here we
have the uh you know finally gkm
actually does something you know it it's
kind of a shock when someone actually
does something in in in in the story uh
gkm actually did something so we have a
a plan approved um and I I don't think
people talk enough about this last part
of the story here so we
invent a
national holiday quote action good
morning GCA and happy unofficial
National right eight day today is a
great 70 degree day and School News
student government has gotten no problem
with food let's go back there let's go
back happy unofficial right Nate day yes
yes we literally invented a national
holiday so that we could trick kids into
writing eight so then we can match their
handwriting samples to it and then
indict them for writing a phone number
on the table and worked we haven't got
to where we find out who it is yet but
it actually worked mission accomplished
and just I mean that actually worked I
can't believe we actually convinced
people to say that on the news we got it
you know approved then we got people to
actually go through and right
eight just I mean honestly probably one
of the greatest spy missions of all time
all right here we go operation infil a
spring break unfold I reviewed my plan V
on March 10th and secure approval both
client and service side that's reference
to post made over on CSM of for friend
Bing at Babbling Brook Mall this was
ening unprecedent something that never
happened before even if I could act
normal GS someone to plan I still need
yeah yeah that's what what Clon suicides
Clon suicide
means you know we talk about how some
has been cleared G Cam's kind of being
stand office as well the jvn sanctions
were working as well the Friday two
episodes of GNN had featured Molly and
president Allison and then we have you
know gam back unfortunately Denver you
know a few stories before just leaked
the plan um and people's failure to
understand seriousness of the situation
with muring the
details and
date so here we go operation infiltrate
here and this is where two Wiz photos
comes in so you know one day I was just
walking around with two Wiz you know
photos I was trying to get the people to
rank people so you know the da was that
someone might write someone's phone
number on the table if they had a crush
on them that was what COA they gave to
me so we went along with that so I was
playing around with this photo editing
you know two wi photoed editing
application and two wi photo editing
application allows you to rank people um
based off of face scans or face scores
you guys know that um we've read an
entire article about this but I'm just
going to show this on the screen here we
have the face Raider uh
application e
testing one
two testing one two oh okay okay we're
back we're back we're back we're back
live okay um anyway let's go back to
this this is two Wiz photos two Wiz
photos Essen allows you to rank people
and now while we were just running
around this and doing this for fun we
also had an alterior motive so that we
could collect data uh to see what was
going on here you can see this in
operation infiltrate um we wanted to
know um who like to so that people would
understand uh so that we could ascertain
who actually wrote the number on the
table so as you can see on the screen
jimal unintentionally so you know we
were just playing around with it you
know people like season 8 season 10
season 9 except of course you know
that's when the brand new SSA policy
came into effect that we don't R people
uh attractiveness and looks it's a
long-standing oneyear SSA policy while
ranking joh Mo unintentionally gave SSA
valuable intelligence he rated jaya8 out
of 10 Hazel 7 out of 10 but Maria
staggering 25 out of 10 breaking records
C than were 2. five times better than
anyone else in I guess world history in
breaking on on the face of the planet
breaking all mathematical and social
conventions for our record uh this new
mobile application helped get him into
game without ranked n out of 10 all
right anyway so this app only goes up to
10 out of 10 you know uh you know like
AA is a 10 like we said quote we can
code AA to be better in quote ssa's plan
uh hatch this for oper and infiltrate
it's another plan to invade G cam we had
like four of these plans to invade gam
and never happened like good grief good
grief anyway going outing this is from
an
official SS document that's why it says
gcam plus not gcam that's s uh cuz I
guess we kind of had the gcam plus uh
naming convention back then all right so
plan one set up John Mia to talk to each
other uh in exchange for Dro helping us
to say all while keeping different the
dark so he doesn't SP the P because of
course when you ran this application you
know we have other people ranking nine
out of 10 etc etc etc so you know we
kind of have to keep people people in
the dark as well also you know Denver
has been leaking stuff all over the
place so we can't we can't have any of
that all right so we have to get them
together on g& in said so encouraging
Maria to talk to Jano we can just change
it in script cuz like he said like like
you know we actually wield the power G G
cam just kind of did didn't didn't
really wield power I collect data from
distance and approach Jano at the quest
then we can either tell Jano but we have
to make sure dver doesn't find out Mar
supect anything and see that no one sus
have across Maria also or maybe can uh
recruit one GC member to get them
together unfortunately doesn't work and
uh using a relatively unknown potential
felon SS was ready ready to infiltrate J
and make history we're going to leverage
the media for our gain we're going to
make SSA great again all right now uh
now for the latest one for the fouls the
gcam foul so as is working together to
get Jano for operation
infiltrate we are now investigating
summer once again her Instagram profile
which was chalk full of uh comments
related to appearance and summer was an
Instagram Powerhouse but relatively weak
in the Spear of influence and guys guess
what around this time like last year we
released an
investigation that
um that that basically said 15% of
comments on the girls post of Instagram
are related to her appearance I proved
there have ai tools on a mobile device
yes that was linked to necessary
investigation here okay you can see how
some of the things here are being linked
as well CU I was like scrolling through
a fe to about 997 followers at this time
and I was like what like why
um what why why are all these comments
you know relatively talking to her uh
talking about her appearance here and
also we also have to get to this really
interesting point here which is almost a
thousand Instagram followers and yet SSA
polls would lose to uh Vera and a
potential head-to-head one-on-one
election Vera you know from the SS ltw
series who lost to some random kid who
came in here uh so the third place
contestant here if everything went by uh
you know smoothly I got like 20 votes so
it be yeah obviously then Addison would
have got like 30 25 something like that
which
mean got like 10 five something like
that wow this is just how and apparently
you know actually the inclusion of
Summer according to SSA polls was
causing gam to lose
popularity so if they were a political
party kicking her out would would have
been better the kid was a social star
but gkm was
losing was losing influence all right
like we just show on the graphic on the
screen they had a super majority on the
student council 74 anything that they
want can pass even the president owed
that but since gcam had been found in
November 17th 20123 according to SS
Internal Documentation report they only
had 17 people in their spe of influence
when you look at the Spirit of influence
chart that I so helpfully Made For You
in Microsoft Word yeah this sphere of
influence try includes president Addison
which by influenc I mean like at war
with so no um I don't know what was I
doing the start D MAV at Jasper okay
fine but
Jazz okay let's actually do a ranking
thing okay uh not ranking R but you've
already done that joke let's do a
banking on of these people outed the SSA
uh which one uh did you C exert the most
control over um from top to bottom all
right let's let's look at this all right
let's go Cody number one then's go uh
Denver uh now mavick was kind of n
uh Kenny T Natalie uh ver no no no no
Das Vera Mary
Allison yeah I mean this spere of
influence is very very nice to them like
jam is really really Fus falling into
isolationism only they the social do
dominance like I said the socialism not
the communism light but like socialism
as in you can go to malls and KRA Scott
but isolationism was causing their
Decline and was to leverage that power
for a m Summit we needed to do it
quickly before power is lost but while
scanning through Instagram again I
noticed something something that crack
the investigation wide open and goes
back to the back story of GK and jvn
story pass we go through here
unfortunately you the redacted text kind
of loses the effect because I has all
the EX x x x's in here and understand
what's going on and we're going to be
seeing some new episodes uh new new
files drop as well okay so these are the
important files that are dropped
everyone like the JFK files no one cares
about these are the gcam files um go
read those bunch more interesting than
uh
the JFK files all right um now back to
Tech
let's
see let's see what all right so I have a
new article this from CBN News which I
said I'm a CBN Christian on EX Christian
uh Jack Rober nice person real nice
person you know follow him he's also
extremely kind of funny by uh he
literally said that schools to be sex
and race segregated again he's the same
person that said that
um you know women shouldn't write songs
cuz they might the men in the crowd
might learn something from them and
women can't teach men
biblically or
something wa where do you get this stuff
anyway from CBN Innovative Bible
projects see just the kind of stuff I'm
interested in okay just like be a normal
disy Evangelical Christian for calling
it like is it that hard like you really
have to sit it around
and Yap about the Greek word that Paul
used and some random book of the Bible
Israel y just just be normal oh my gosh
just wait would it kill you anyway from
CPN new and we'll have this up on the
screen and then we'll do Mr M the boss
react I'm one of those in a in a long
time hopefully this works
Innovative uh Bible project
opens uh to to million to 56 million
languages wait what oh in 56 in 56
languages so if you guys don't know
Bible project is uh is this thing that
allows you to
see videos about the Bible on YouTube
and like really really good high quality
animation and it actually makes you know
some of the more boring section of the
Bible seem really interesting it has
like the Bible kind of like has a tap
hisory rolled out around
the the like like on a scroll or
something here and it kind of show you
how the Bible is linked in with each of
kind of like how I'm trying to show how
s LW linking in from all the events from
all things from 20 2014 since SSA since
to Sun's arrival in 2024 to the events
that happened later there some links to
20120 and 2021 right anyway tued away in
a quiet Portland neighborhood kind of
you know it's nice you know the studio
bone to the ground uh but a long time
klege friends Tim Macky and John
Collins Bible animation thing they have
over 18 videos 250 podcast episodes and
over the internet and I kind of really
like this imit
oh well there's an image in the original
article it's not showing K but it's an
image this is from the CBN mobile
application I guess it's the embedded
thing here but uh that's an embedded
video um I guess it's from from the
video here at the top
so this is from TV so I mean look look
how well animated they are but here's
the Bible project Studios I'm trying to
show the
image here like is that look at look how
Hightech it looks they have like
computers in the background have a nice
podcast recording studio um it's just
really really interesting the you know
the links between regular Evangelical
Christianity in the Bible um you know we
that that's actually interesting not
this random arguing on uh online about
iname point to try to just create some
new theological Point that's never been
heard of before women shouldn't write
songs that that's
that that's what you came up with that
that was your hot take for the day oh
yeah it was hot I mean I have never seen
you know redem Zuma you know I sometimes
go after him he sometimes goes after me
I've ever seen redem Zuma and I actually
agree on something I mean
that I
mean women shouldn't write
songs it's
what bro where do you come up with this
stuff
anyway just it's kind of like that uh
that
uh it's kind of like Bumble like come
back to me when you have a decent
GUI or it can make decent
points
just okay all know let's see what our
articles for today are want to see if we
have any more
articles just okay first of all let's
keep the cell phones on school radiation
and no radiation ridiculous second of
all you know that woman in the dress
property isn't fat oh yes 50% of North
Americans say that I have R this comes
after 15 uh actually year after 15.6% of
comments on uh uh girl's Instagram post
or related to appearance is that
related I don't
no no no it's not related oh oh oh I
almost forgot about this United States
very patriotic episode for today we
already had two United States mentions
here has released or is releasing a
sixth sixth or seventh generation some
some generation fighter here this from
the United States Air Force um
the what what's it called the Air Force
f47 plane here hope you can see this
video so that's the first generation
here this must have
been let's see what we can see what the
uh f47 looks like what what it can do Bo
a got the contract so hopefully the
plane stays in the air and the door
doesn't fall off oh yes look at that
look at that sixth
generation sixth generation
fighter wait oh that's it so uh you know
we don't want it to get leaked to China
or anything like that so please please
keep it under under wraps
also um keep the doors on make sure it
doesn't fall out the sky you know normal
things that we want um planes to
do so so hopefully you know the the
planes don't fall out of the sky all
right um here is another device really
interesting device here probably doesn't
even work here but remember that email
device that came out when I was 2 years
old called the the peak uh it was like
an email for email
but here was one for from 2009 for
Twitter apparently it's a
199 device that just let you send off
tweets
which I mean you still have to car your
phone you still have to you know have a
computer to check your email why would
anyone pay for this even in
2009 that no no email no texting that's
it you could just get like a smartphone
for this thing right I mean yeah it has
a nice big uh keyboard
here but I mean I wonder if it still
works and also what kind of operating
system I'm pretty something get a
browser to run on that thing or Doom to
on that thing that's that's yeah it has
it has to work differently all right I'm
going to pull up uh Mr who's the boss
YouTube video here hopefully it
works oh wait I won't even be able to
hear what he says cuz I have
the the mic
off but I I I think I've seen the video
and maybe I can have captions toned on
as well thank thank goodness for
captions captions captions are
amazing all he's going to be we're going
to be doing
uh testing out the cheap versus
mid-range versus uh expensive phones
here and I think this is going to really
reveal a major problem on uh technology
companies uh you know
today all right so as the software is
loading um this is going to be you know
taking
I guess we're just going to add a new
input
yeah right hope you can see this on the
screen this is M's the boss's
it won't load okay maybe we can do this
uh
next next week oh wait no no no no no no
it's back it's back all it's
playing with Pro Plan sport incredible
happens
[Music]
here but it stopped skip oh
this isn't just
a wait another ad and we're back with
the T on a Metro deal you won't want to
miss right now at Metro get
a I have just b as you can see on the
screen we're going to be reviewing
multiple um phone and displays as
well
um it's a two Samsung phones we have the
Samsung X a56 and the Samsung Galaxy s24
Ultra um and I think that's interesting
though I maybe it probably would be
better if we had some more competition
uh you know in here and also we have a
xiaomi phone I believe that is uh that
we that we have here um so I think it's
really interesting here as well a
better how much difference is in 2025
because on paper this makes zero sense
the
$1,300 so that's the price of the phone
Sam Ultra
$133,000 on
it all right what 200 megapixel camera
so does the $300 redmi note 14 Pro Plus
the Samsung has a premium metal and
glass body but so but yeah also both
phones have a metal and glass spting as
well is this the flagship has a large
5,000 mAh battery but then actually the
budget phone gets an extra 110 million
hours on top of that and you might say
oh well the difference now is AI
Flagship phones have ai I'm I'm just
going to go in and check the comments
make sure that the audio uh is being
accepted and is
well no comments here for today I think
that's all for now now we can this video
later go talk to later</pre>
