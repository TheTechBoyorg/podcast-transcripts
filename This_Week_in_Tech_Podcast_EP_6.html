[Music]
[Music]
all right
here's our screen we're ready
all right
as you might notice we have a brand new
banner behind us thank you to the big
five conference for giving us this
banner i will link the website in the
description of this video at the
conclusion of this recording
okay
and i also have my grant led lights in
the background i hope you can see them
today and we have a very special episode
that's about to come up right now so
first i have some things i want to show
you i have created some new wallpapers
these are just some prototypes they'll
change a little bit but this is
basically the wallpaper design that you
can get of course from us from free so
here we go
that is wallpaper one
a nice brown and yellow wallpaper with
orange rectangles and a red circle
and let me pull up the next wallpaper
it's called summer you have palm trees
um
gradient background and the sun
so let me
get this now
so i hope you appreciate those
wallpapers they'll be available to
download from youtube and from our
website
okay
um let's talk about what happened this
week in the tech boy okay other than the
wallpapers we have been active we
reviewed the deep stack endoscope so
let's get into that
okay this is the deep stick endoscope
it
allows you to see through i mean not
doing but underneath and around things
with its camera and i actually have it
here in the office right now so i'm
going to pull it out
and hold it up to the camera
here it is i hope you can see it
uh
this is the size comparison to a cell
phone
so almost as big as my a71 5g
but this chord is 16 and a half feet
long
and let's get into what we talked about
in that article so in the article i
stated that this was a good endoscope
but
um
it could be a bit better here's some
test pictures so here we have our drain
pipes and some water
that's demonstrating the
way you can read text
there's a drain pipe again and here's a
test sample video
so that's going into the drain pipe
um i don't think there's sound
yeah i don't know but this is embedded
on the website you can read it it's not
on youtube and speaking of youtube
um our videos are now
as you can see
youtube no cookie so when you block
these cookies
magical
you can still watch our youtube videos
example here's the nothing event live
blog
well see this one hasn't been changed
but um recent ones more recently wasn't
changed
so if you see that notice just email me
and tell me to fix it and we will
okay we also posted something else
i designed this image myself in
photoshop alexa is going on this trip
into space it's not the actual alexa but
it's going to be using alexa like
technology and we'll be able to ask
alexa questions during the flight of the
spaceship
so
i will be publishing the questions and i
asked alexa about the space flight and
publishing responses here
but for now there's nothing new
okay
that's not all that you've had this week
we also are really pushing the indiegogo
camp game
okay we've had our first donor
so please
donate to the indiegogo camp game
so you can reach 2 500
so we can get new devices to test
if you want to see us review folding
phones the z4 the z flip 4
the new motorola phone that just came
out if you can get a hold of that
uh
this is nokia feature phone i want to
test it's about 40 dollars
so that's good so
all right
i will try to get that nokia feature
phone but in order to require the money
to do so
we're selling off of achievas
video walkie-talkies so
please buy these okay i'm selling them
at a good price
on ebay i will drop the link in the
description
so you can
buy them and you may be able to see
review of the picture phone
i actually found out that this has a web
browser on it and i think it has a
camera but it's not running android it's
not really ios not even running ios so
we'll see this might be a very
interesting
excuse me
and i'm also wearing the bluetooth
headphones
they sound really good
the battery life seems pretty
decent and last but not least
september 1st we've had the
uh tech award tech awards okay i changed
it to september
so
companies that have sent us review units
