<h1>This Week In TheTechboy Podcast 11423</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the this week in
the Tech booy podcast everyone I have a
very important um feature to show you in
the software that we have here um but
first let's play the music and I'll get
my headphones so hello and welcome to
the tech booy This Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast
hello everybody and welcome to this week
in the techboy podcast as you guys um
know and if you don't know you should
know that we take clips of every um or
we try to take clips of every episode um
here in like so we'll take a clip and
then it will show on screen so we'll
have YouTube videos for the
next you so I'm trying to show you my
streamyard software if it allows me to
it's not allowing me to oh here it
is hopefully you can see this on the
screen don't mind them here um so
usually I have to go back put it in
search for the text I put in but if I go
into the settings icon here and then I
go into hot
Keys you can create your own hotkey to
create a marker and this will Mark will
create a Tim stamp for me and this Tim
stamp world me to go back and know when
to clip my video so I'm going to do that
actually right now so I'm going to click
the m
key oh it says we couldn't create a
market track
okay wow two people already watching
well hello to the two people watching
out there unfortunately the marketing's
not working maybe if I do it off uh well
it looks like the marketing's kind of
broken um but anyway hello to the two
people watching out there that's
actually one of the fastest uh time you
forgotten someone to come in so let me
just make sure the commenting system is
working today all right and then I'm
going to go edit in YouTube Studio we
got something really exciting here today
in studio um we got our Wi-Fi intend of
the book the um company Panda wiress
thank you panda Wireless for sending
this to us not sponsored but they gave
it to us for free um sent us a Wi-Fi ant
and after a few days of work um I got it
working on VMware Player of course we
don't have a license for that so it's
only non-comercial so I can't really
show it on screen but I can you know
tell you about it pretty sure that's
legal um so I can tell you about how the
thing
works and just before the podcast
started I was able to execute my first
ever the ofation attack now for some
reason this antenna the penda pal isn't
I guess picking up every device on the
network but I still have I have an Udi
course that I need to that complete so
I'm finishing that out um virtual box
didn't work well with it for some reason
but virtual box is weird you know it's
like free so that's to be expected and I
figured out how to enable monitor mode
on the uh W wire shock like regular um
you actually have to enable it in the
settings and reinstallation so I will
plug in my Alpha antenna soon and then
tell you if monitor mode works there and
if it does then we'll update the review
on unfortunately um I have not been able
to intercept anything notable on wi
shock for Windows maybe I'll be able to
do it why shock for card Linux on my
virtual box machine thing and this is
one of the reasons that I couldn't you
know switch to Android fulltime for
computing because until they add virtual
machines onto Android or add support for
Des antennas and Cal Linux on non
Android I wouldn't be able to do this um
kind of cyber security things all right
um let me just go into YouTube Studio to
fix
this speaking of YouTube YouTube's
changed the way the application works
again um a few weeks maybe months ago
they experimented with putting the like
account settings thing at the bottom of
the screen on mobile but then they
changed it back to a few days oh my oh
never mind changed it back to a few days
and
it it's back so now your account thing
is on the bottom well at least for me
um maybe if you guys haven't gotten the
updates yet it isn't working and
speaking of working let me see if my
heart key works
again
oh I know they still can't create a
makaku that's unfortunate okay let me
see down here
[Music]
um
wait a second I can add
guests for fre never been nice to I
never changed to hot key back to default
so the heartkey default is B so let me
try touching
b nope still not working okay so that
feature still needs to be rolled out
tested better um but you know we have
plenty to get into today we today is the
day that we talk about
um AI music we're going to talk about
um last week we talked about how AI is
going to save Africa you know people
can't afford running water we just gonna
supercharge AI so that's that's a lotion
I guess you know um but we're also going
to talk about Huawei Mr the boss um
tested out some Huawei
products and it they were good I guess
but China could be lying
about the um efficacy of the 7 nmet chip
it could be 14 nmet but they're saying
it's s net and pretending like that it's
seven nmet so we don't know um also
Apple devices are having some type of in
Safari and iOS um because all iOS
devices basically use Safari even if you
use a third- party browser it uses the
web kit rendering engine or whatever um
there's this proof of concept not proof
of concept sorry research paper that is
showing that iPhones and and Mac um
because it's affecting Safari primarily
um in the M1 ship M1 chip and most chips
go and try to predict what instructions
it's going to do it's really complicated
but in
essence it can
intercept passwords and emails from a
browser leg legitimately so even if you
have a password manager and use autofill
data and you go to the legitimate
Instagram website or the legitimate uh X
website and log in then you they will
still get your password because it's not
a fishing page and of course on a more
on a less technical but more still you
know technologically advanced I'm
getting all this from satanic by the way
check out this video I can link it down
in the description below um there's
this special type of characters that
pretend to make it look like a website
let's say you're trying to Lo um buy an
antivirus password manager they'll go
into Google ads and then buy up the
first search results right like a normal
legitimate business would do but their
domain is going to look weird I mean
normal but it's actually going to look
weird because I use a special type of
character so let's say I went to Tech
boy. watching right but I use like the
critic alphabet and change the domain
around
like
xp. right but it shows up as the tech
boy.org just the T kind of looks a
little funny well if we have logins on
there I guess or if I have like hostage
software on there you could pretend to
be the tech.org you just clone the
website put it on host it of course and
then put malicious software there and
then post and downloads it or downloads
like last pass but it's not actually
last pass even though they think it's
from the legitimate domain name except
that last pass software is malware and
in this instance the malware is a vector
for more powerful malware to come on um
which is why I use an anti actually have
that tuned off because it was blocking
my downloads from col and stuff um so
that's I guess a disadvantage
there
um
also um let me just share this you know
online um so that people actually come
out and watch let's see copy link
address okay here we
go
we can also talk about um I'm
live oh hello to viewer number one
welcome back um oh they just left that's
so sad oh it's probably because I shared
it and then it went away okay that makes
sense okay
um first let's check out today's
headline head sorry headlines from the
tech boy.org
this is the greatest Tech website in the
internet on the internet oh I almost
forgot I um the tech booy have
discovered my own vulnerability and it's
being taken uh seriously and we're going
to talk about that right now I don't
want to share that stop screen we're
going to share the techboy website here
it
is being AI has been discovered to break
through um pay
walls and it's legitimately scary I'd
say um to um
Publishers um and it's actually the
first number one article on the tech.org
this week so that's great and of course
we review the boogie board jot last week
we reviewed the alpha a w s o 036 a
CM review so the boogie board drot I
mean we can talk about that it's okay
like you get some bluish around the
edges here so I guess that's could be
considered the future right it's at a
really good price I guess um it's basic
but it works you know we reviewed it
it's been backpack tested kid tested
kids have drawn on it um kids filled it
in so you know I say that it's a pretty
complete review the only thing that we
haven't done because our refrigerator
doesn't work like that is that we have
not stuck it onto a refrigerator because
a refrigerator is not magnetic on the
front but this is really important being
AI which this image was generated by
being Ai and I hate how this website
software doesn't allow me to drag images
over here like even when I Justified
them over here when you check the code
um
yeah there see it says margin Auto left
margin Auto right no text the line
center right but if I said left which is
why I want wanted
it and
then click out of this boom it would be
there but the image still has all of
this what I would like is here and then
the text come up here my caption over
here but unfortunately it doesn't look
like that all right and of course that
only keeps it for my feeling here anyway
being AI can break through pay walls you
could just give the entire text of the
article and just got picked up by a
larger news Outlet um some of you may
know him and love him uh Dan Dylan after
I reported it to him um here's what he
had to say on x
okay did he change his profile
picture uh okay let's see being
[Music]
AI ah here it is quote so we found a
frightening issue with being AI thank
you thank you you're very uh you're very
welcome that that was me that was me um
the seems to expose info from web pages
are protected from ification simp ask to
summarize a news article that's behind a
pay wall and it will it will even
produce content for you ver ver it
appears Microsoft is violating some
serious IP and privacy laws here how is
this possible what can we even do about
it according to him it's in the HTML so
I guess um his site and many other site
hello super
Hy um his site and many other sites I
tested this on Fortune and over Bon b
um I I put in I did the same prompt I
did it and we got this R aity so you
guys are welcome
and how many people oh okay and quote
yep I tested it and told them this is my
first ever pin
test um yeah so it can summarize news
articles behind pay
walls if you the
quotes one
two
yeah that's me I did it found the
vulnerability so I'd say that's great
you know breakthrough for Tech media um
worldwide and stop
Shing so
truly a great day for the tech boy but
bad day for everybody you know else
involved in this hopefully they can you
know get this remedied and fixed for
everyone
because I reported it to Microsoft I
don't think I heard anything back from
them they said it wasn't really security
vulnerability however I mean this is a
major issue for Publishers worldwide
because
like being AI can just tell you what the
website it's saying which means people
won't have to pay to access content
anymore I mean this could even help you
find like privated videos I mean this
would be really good for ENT I guess but
not good for private content pu shoes no
I wouldn't say that they're breaking any
laws since it's not like break into
password or anything it's just that the
website security isn't good enough to
bypass a
scraper maybe um you can get what are
they called like a do not the robot text
file yeah maybe you could create like a
special Advanced type robot text file
for that's for like search engines not
to scrape you maybe they can have like
an AI thing that to scrape you and it's
blocked with that but of course you know
I guess anyone could get off the shelf
and make it themselves
and yeah so maybe just like not load the
text in HTML and just load it behind a
pay wall and a totally different URL but
I'm not sure how that would mess with
traffic you'd have to add ask Dan about
that because we don't have payall
content on the tech
boy okay speaking of the tech boy um
we'll
probably have a shorter podcast next
week or maybe later well we'll see about
that but you know we still have a
podcast we will keep trying to get this
streak um going we don't want to ever
Miss uh a Saturday or Sunday is because
one time we upload like 12 midnight
because internet's is
slow all right let's get into the tech
news for the week Samsung is
improving the S I mean Samsung's
improving Bixby so that's good hopefully
they bring the improvements that I asked
for it looks like the integrating chat
GPT so that's you know good if it works
well hopefully they get the voice
commands working well and s in text
and
among such efforts what is it called
Sammy fans Sammy fans is reporting this
and of course oneui is coming out well
it's already out it should be coming to
my phone
soon it's been quick it's been a quick
release
um in comparison to like last year so
that's good for Samsung it's good for
Android worldwide you know it's it's
good to stop having the stereotype that
Samsung phones are bad and and slow
hopefully they can get the keyboard you
know I guess
better and here it is Samsung 1ui 6.0
based on Android
14 um and then I guess we can talk about
Harmony OS which um contrary to PO
belief is not its own operating system
it's Bas off asop so just like heavily
skinned thing oh oh and speaking of like
connectiveness cuz it's really connected
with like the one OnePlus M pad the
OnePlus not OnePlus M pad the Huawei M
pad Huawei phones and Huawei watches and
Huawei earbuds and yes we still have
that ban on reviewing a Huawei
project on the podcast um it's really
interconnected and sync right um well
speaking of interconnectivity and in
syncing The Flipper zero does finally or
I guess not finally software for the
flip it allows you to do that kind of
little dos attack for the iPhones where
you Bluetooth spam it but you can
Bluetooth spam Android with Bluetooth
notifications and Bluetooth spam Windows
Bluetooth notifications it's not as a
few but it can still be annoying and I
hope to get my hands on a flippers zero
soon to test this out in a safe and
legal way well I guess it's not illegal
as it it's just like Bluetooth going out
I mean
but I guess safe and legal
and ethical um anyway Sammy fans R 6.0
um public b b programs all Samsung
devices released with Android 12 um
pre-installed are eligible for this
support which is interesting also
Samsung Galaxy s20 and Note2 series will
be getting this update which is good
that means it's going to get like four
years of updates and maybe years a
security update so that's great um I
know people have s20s
who well I know people have s20s um
hopefully this comes to s2f as I think
it will right so here it is it's rolled
out to s23 and it's still on the beta
but I haven't been able to get on the
beta yet unfortunately so that's why I
haven't seen any videos articles about
the beta and yeah we're a country on
here China really okay um and the phones
that can oh okay I guess s t is not a
beta
device and there's of course we talked
about the quick panel and lock screen
it's going to have like bigger icons and
bigger blur hello Robert K we're just
talking about the S uh 20 series getting
onei um also have has your phone that
what's it A14 a13 whatever it is um
gotten any
updates um of course to be increased
brightness controls to be better lock
screen stuff so the stuff that's in good
lock not going be coming over to oneui
and then I guess a brand new default
font and I may switch back over to the
oneui launcher just you know test this
out have some fun and maybe go back to
Microsoft launcher oh Samsung
Dex or that's for tablets and the link
to Windows is also on Tab that's
interesting new mode she design the
camera app has also been redesigned
hopefully that they can get the shutter
speed that shutter speed loading speed
improved that could be improved um let's
let's
okay hopefully you can
see oh okay I'm not going to do that one
two oh that's for front facing
okay let's try this
again yeah it takes like a good half
second and Robert says pretty much just
security yeah that's unfortunate you
know maybe should the guide in the phone
that's well what do you think about the
one not oneui pixel 8 and as we wait for
him to question about uh answer about
this hopefully Samsung could also in
integrate some more AI features I here
the s24 is going to be more AI powerful
due to the Snapdragon hen we talked
about this last week Snapdragon hen
doing having specified AI cores but I'm
pretty sure that you could you know
maybe a bit slower get some of the
features
on Late Model older late model Samsung
devices like s22 s23 maybe um but maybe
I'll be able to get s24 who knows you
know how much would the s22 trade in be
maybe get something off of eBay I've
been waiting for the s24 to come out
because then the s23 ult prices will
drop on eBay and maybe I'll be able to
review one right make some money sell it
speaking of selling um I would have
someone interested in this so you know I
guess you could buy it good well I like
how Android is the resale value is
pretty bad yeah that's what I'm talking
about like when I get pixel fa 600
off oh well that means it's about
$900 or
850b in the UK yeah um speaking of
resell TCL 40
XL I'm selling this basically brand new
I opened it on stream and that's
basically it play a little bit but in
great condition with the box with a
charger that's great and to the people
oh let's see if my hoty works here oh my
goodness you can't even make a market
one time not ah one 1.2k from
1.8k oh it must be more expensive
in the UK because it's
1799 in in the US but I'm pretty sure
you could get one
for cheap anyway I I saw I did see one
fold online
for a Samsung fold like fold for for
$900 so I mean you can get a folding
phone for less than a flagship now days
like you you can get a Galaxy zold 4 for
less than the original iPhone 10 um when
it launched in 2017 that's
insane
um let's see if it has any AI features
in
here space here again oh no nothing
about AI in here semi fans is an okay
website I am subscribed to their
telegram Channel but they like some of
this stuff is just clickbait
oh here it is Samsung oneui 6 Bix
Improvement okay so this is Bix
improvements hopefully talking about
Bixby on smartphone
um it it's bringing shortcuts and like
widgets to Bixby so that's good new
front new Cuts game that's I guess
that's nice but what I'm really
interested in seeing is if it's faster
and it's more reliable and the voice to
text is better just saw a f for7 70
pounds not so much in the UK when
new yeah I think Samsung's good on
pricing everything the same in multiple
region and also you know speaking of
Samsung I wish that the Galaxy tags
worked with all Android devices like I
always probably St Samsung but if I like
got a Galaxy tag I'd have to sell it or
trade it in or something like that for I
mean it's not too expensive it's like 20
$30 um but it it could just be better
you know work with all Android devices
just maybe make it better for Samsung
maybe only include WWB or have some type
of special warranty if you have a
Samsung device or something like that
and make it like prove that you have a
Samsung device and not just buying it
from a
friend all right let's get into our
YouTube um SE of the show we're going to
talk
about
the
Huawei things of course we we still
don't like Huawei you know baned and of
course I I wouldn't encourage anyone to
buy a Huawei device but you know oh
let's see what this says I'm thinking of
buying a new M3
MBP M3 oh M3 Mac Pro to compare to my M1
if it's not worth it for me then I got
till January 8th to return return it
interesting um I've been thinking about
getting a Mac but I'm not sure about
that like this this computer is is old
and
slow from
2019 half the keys don't work like the
backspace key the minus key
the the touchcreen like the entire
touchcreen does not work is like I think
it works if I touch it here it freezes
and lags when I do the touch screen um
like I had it flipped around for the
conference last week when I was like
telling people about the business so
shout out to all of you who are watching
from there use to Advantage the Apple
Christmas return poliy yeah when I get
older old enough to have like a credit
card and stuff well maybe not credit
card debit card I probably w't use a
credit card a debit card I'll put money
on it and then I'll like just put like a
$1,000 on it and then I'll like buy some
Samsung phone off of Amazon review it
and then return it back to Amazon and
then keep doing the same thing so I can
like keep up with all the latest
technology without you know actually
having to buy a phone it would be like
free renting of cell phones which I
guess you could technically do for the
rest of your life you could always have
a brand new cell phone have your backup
sync to the cloud and everything um that
would basically be our business model
and then when people then they drive
traffic to the website they would drive
traffic to the YouTube channel which
would then cause people to actually you
know send us stuff which we could then
ship off for you know lower prices and
you know make a profit but right now we
can't make too much of a profit because
then you'd have to file for taxes that
would be a headache um anyway back to
what we were talking about um back to W
I have seen this ad like seven times
already so I'm going to mute him for
your own convenience we're not going to
watch the entire video we're GNA just
like see the um admittedly um
interesting
looking um software feature that this
tablet has it looks I I guess you could
say Space Age it looks Hightech it looks
like something that you would see in a
movie um however you know of course this
is probably stolen technology um it it's
banned for a reason you know so
obviously totally not um celebrating or
promoting Huawei I saw that video earli
yeah the phone it's nice I guess but
like we don't know what kind of chip it
has you don't know which under the hood
it's you know it's some random Chinese
company I wouldn't use a Huawei phone
and I definitely wouldn't put my Google
account on here but let's just get to
the key moments of the video which would
be the tablet which is it's like a basic
Android tablet but you have to see this
like all-in-one ecosystem thing that
they're trying to show here which I mean
isn't that special like you
can it may maybe using it own connection
protocol but I'm not sure about the
thing right here go I actually want to
go big screen I just go into full screen
on my phone and then automatically it
will not just full screen on the tablet
but actually entire mean look at this I
mean I made of course like I saying
again disclaimer we're not promoting
hway let me put this quality up so you
can see it 720p oh okay let me just zoom
in system just
kind you see this system of devices
around here um I'm not sure if it works
based on you know like location or
proximity to the device in relation to
its um on XY coordinates like say you're
here if that's what it actually is it
would actually help you like find a
phone I think you should buy a fair
phone oh we talked about the fail phone
a few weeks ago we can you know go back
to it and talk about how annoying
environmentalism is in cell phones well
we'll get back to that okay
um here it is and one of the points that
he makes here I can search the
transcript in here
um and this is like a big issue I guess
not in technology but like in the entire
you know United States and the West at
large the in the entire Free World
um so pack there it is okay um I have
that queed up like you can just drag
this on and then we'll connect that's
nice basically like upgraded Apple
ecosystem but speak speaking of Eco um
here it is full size
box here it is this is the phone segment
please this
game you're not ready for it yeah I'm
sure that
okay still comes with a fullsize box
five seconds back two major Flagship
launches okay so this a p60
pro um which recently this one is the
Huawei p60 Pro which still comes with a
fulls size box including everything you
need for the phone I think this is still
the default for phone sold in China
whereas it's more in the west where we
have this whole focus
on are you kidding
me this
game you're not
ready Eco pack Eco packaging is annoying
Eco companies are also annoying like
fearone okay
um when I buy like I made this point
multiple times we can make it again yeah
it's funny uh whatever I made this point
multiple times we can make it again and
I will keep making it okay when I buy a
Samsung phone I do not care that it is
made out of recycled aluminum found at
the bottom of the ocean to save the
manatees and it is you know putting off
set of 1% Coop emissions I could care
less not going to lie I saw my dad's old
S9 box the SCS piness St true and ites
did have that veritable apture right but
back to the Eco thing Fair phone okay um
they actually have a light off Sense on
so that's you know nice I actually I'm
glad that they you know
actually put something in that whole
Space instead of like pretending it has
three cameras they say has three cameras
but that's counting one two and then
three that's not three cameras it's two
on the back and one on the front that's
not like okay
Samsung could literally say oh man we
got this 4 camera design which sure I
guess it could say that anyway back to
Eco design I don't care about the
Recycled aluminum I don't care if it's
made out of recycled titanium I don't
care how many carbon offsets or carbon
credits or carbon carbon neutral
or I'm trying to buy a phone okay and if
you really cared about carbon in the
environment and packaging
which whatever um let's just give you
guys the benefit of that out and of
doing this for the right reason I I
still want an extra charger people lose
charges all the time if I'm paying
$1,000 for a phone I'm expecting a
charger okay back in 2009 20 2008 2009
when phones were less expensive but I
guess the same because inflation um you
know and they had less features because
you know it's 2009 um you would get
charger earphones a manual um
a quick start
guide maybe even some like a Bluetooth
the RF little earpiece thing for it a
holster a case I mean you you'd get
basically an entire box of accessories
right that's un like unboxing like if
you if I were to check an unboxing video
from say 2008 2009 or whatever you'd
actually see stuff in the box but if I
were to do an unboxing video of say an
s23 ultra okay we got and the s23 ultra
would actually be more packed than a
normal like video okay so we open the
box right and then we get to our
recycled aluminum to save the manate
thing you pull it back boom s23 Ultra
you push the button on the phone get
your s
spin oh oh you open it put it again get
your cable that's
it I guess phone's being Samsung Apple
just at this point I guess but like they
sent you a cable but no plug-in thing
especially if it's like the newer USBC
type thing how many people you think
have an actual USBC CK um
charger like I never had one until I got
my a71 um 5G but that came in the box
right I would have had to use like some
random you know usba a to USBC type
charger which I admittedly kind of like
like better
because it you know you can plug it into
your computer if you don't have USBC on
your computer or something like that but
USBC to USBC does mean that newer type
cars you can plug in your USBC um cable
to USBC and you know charge it so I
guess it's a trade-off there and of
course in newer type homes you can plug
in USBC to see no adapter
needed however like a case in the box
that would be nice right you'll be
saving money on warranty payments and I
guess
like I guess you could you know fost a
Goodwill with your company
but I guess you'd
be losing things like
that even maybe let's say s24 Ultra
comes out right in those SV cases it's
like the flip case they have a little
tiny screen on the top it's like powered
by the phone I think U maybe you could
like throw that in the Box for free
maybe it's say free phone free charger
in the box or maybe have type of deal
with the caros that says every phone you
get a free charge you're in the box or
something like that that that would be
nice you know it it would be respecting
the consumer without you know throwing
them away to save the manatees at the
bottom of the ocean um using recycled
aluminum and cardboard paper packaging
because I don't care what my box is made
out of really okay my box is you just
going to sit on the Shelf so I can check
the ime address one time or another or
sit on the Shelf so I could package it
up and and send it off on eBay to
someone but it I'm not you know playing
with the Box so you know like eating the
box like the only the only interesting
box would be probably like the zold one
box that now that's an actual box that
people like when people sell a box on
eBay that's basically a scam is like why
would youall want the box to a phone
with no phone in it but the zold one box
is reallyu one of the boxes of all
time you have faitas a m look at
this and and the zold one was you know
they had respect for the customers there
they had um they had customer like
basically
service where's the zold one
buck
zold
one basically got their own
little um thing where you call the
people and they do stuffff for you um
external like zold box I think it's sold
un unfolded you take the plastic off and
that's it you don't even get a charge
you're spending $1,700 so I wouldn't you
know actually buy her like look at this
hope you can see this on the screen you
can get a Galaxy zold 5 unbox open box
free shipping Samsung warranty top rated
Plus for only a
$1,000 $1,069 do division F box look
like oh yeah forgot about that piece of
um that's actually a good question Apple
takes pride in their boxes I'm I'm
pretty sure that box would retail for
$100 on eBay um no
sweat let's see here like you can get
this phone was legitimately
1,799 um at when they released this
August August it is November early
November at the time of recording this
um podcast no where'd you go Robert come
back oh you can't see this on the screen
that's
right it is early November at the time
of recording this and you can get this
for legitimately $1,000 free shipping
Samsung warranty top rated open box and
this isn't a scam I not promotion I
don't know who this guy is you this guy
basically has a 1,00 not 1,00 100%
approval rating from 177,000 people okay
so this isn't just some random person
selling um stuff off of eay and you can
get this for lower than the s23 ultra
from Samsung lower than the
S probably I
mean you can get it with the s pin it
looks like let's see I'm gonna pick it
um 256 gigabytes for black I'm pretty
sure that's the
cheapest
169 does it come with the spin oh these
look like stock fots but still 1,000
only $1,000 which admittedly is you know
a lot of money but that is
basically uh 40% off
of this is basically a 40% off sale and
it's not even Black Friday yet I'm
pretty sure that this will Creator by
the end of the year
to like a thousand maybe but let's get
back to the phone uh sub th000 sorry
like 900 like the F four is already
there back to the phone so I don't
really care about this phone I want to
talk about the mate phone look at it
okay um he says she likes it better than
Apple's Dynamic Island but I don't like
are you gonna touch right there and
right there like is there gonna be a
notification or something right there
and I'm going to talk about the features
that i' like to see Android um bring
well I guess this is Android but you
know more Android manufacturers bring to
the pro your uh table so here we go way
of still having proper 3D face scanning
ability while which yeah I mean I
would I mean I use a
keyboard password to get in but to
minimizing the amount of solid black
permanently on your screen it's think if
you have a fingerprint SC or you can
like collect people's fingerprints
please apps
that of an interruption than Apple's
Dynamic islands and actually faster face
scanning plus we just realized today
something else very yeah probably
because there like three cameras 3D
allows it to do which is to constantly
be looking to see if your eyes are
looking at the phone screen if they are
the screen will be on and as soon as you
look Look Away the screen will turn off
which is great for battery and also
being able to check your notifications
it's like a smarter version of the
always on displ I think Samsung used to
have a feature like that where you can
like keep screen on when you're looking
at it but as where you're actually like
using the phone or let's say you're like
watching a YouTube video or looking at
an article play because it's only always
on when you need it to be always on the
body of the phone is matte all the way
around and while the bottom can get some
fingerprints the top section is
completely resistant the corners
extremely curved it doesn't feel like
you're holding a sharp object it's like
a nice Pebble I guess it's the opposite
and the fact that the back plat like I
like this I think this is like real I
like how it's nice and curved here you
have your SIM tray here well I guess not
sim it's like some type of specials oh
no they have like a special little SD
card stinky yeah smoothly transitions
into the sides means there's no seam to
worry about but then also this screen
we've seen curved sides on a screen
before but this is really softly even
the curved from every single angle top
bottom corners and they've done that
without making the borders uneven or
having any weirdness with the corners
which you and this software is kind of
you know Garis but I do like the
features that they have here in the
animations imagine using Tik Tok on a
Chinese phone it's like double whing
spy app like okay very smooth similar
quality to the iPhone but just with more
flexibility and flare and it works so
well with the curved glass from every
angle to and for they had like being AI
pre-loaded on here I'm that sure is
Microsoft working with Huawei or if they
just like being maybe Google maybe just
mad at Google or something create this
feeling of elegant what why would does
what's it called B have his own search
engine and gracefulness and if you're
enjoying this rare look into Huawei
right now then a lot has gone into
making it happen so the sub to the
channel would be harmonious how much
like could I get let's see I mean it's
not illegal to buy something from try
let's see um let's see
p60 let's check it just make this you
know
legitimate p64 12 okay this looks
legitimate this person has a 1,000
cating okay
sh
I'm not
sure okay that looks legitimate because
you can see the fingerprints on it
defeats the point of an a phone just
turns on when you look at it so
a true I guess like if you wanted to use
those a clock display but I guess you
can always turn that feature off okay
course not like
defending the the company or anything
but you know I guess we try to be but I
of course would not recommend buying or
even using one of these devices and we
actually have a ban on this for guest
boosters to talk about it though I guess
we can lift it in
to also I'm heading off to Japan today
for a once in a lifetime trip where I'll
get to see lots of cool Tech like okay
let's look at his U mate 30 pro video
and see how well it's age because I
remember tying a story about how um
Huawei kept making the same phone they
said they make D but then they upgraded
the internals which
means which means they could get around
the US band there and use like axle
Android but then I guess have to stop I
guess they didn't want to keep using the
same design so this is from four years
ago from M Duty Pro with his craphy is
iffy it's okay
he's gotten a lot better over the past
two years like that's what I start I
don't really like
it welcome to one of the most hyped but
divisive
brilliant it's okay but at the same time
problematic phones the world the
music is better than his new videos has
ever seen we've literally just had the
P30 Pro a few months ago had an
incredible camera and an off the charts
battery life look at the old Google
messages icon but now the mate 30 Pro is
huawei's new Kingpin and let me tell you
it really is something huawei's mate
Series has always been their plus-sized
maxed out smartphone lineup for the pro
user and that has not changed here
compared to the P30 PR 6.47 in display
which was pretty good the mate comes
with a 6.53 in OLED Horizon display or
to put that another way one massive
curve you've probably already seen the
curve displays on Samsung phones well
this is another level it almost bends
90° around the sides pretty reminiscent
of vivo's recent next device okay
yeah with familiar shamers and curves
and the rounded corner I want to see the
specs let's see what he says here
see it's most watched currency layer for
that extra Touch of minimalism but
there's no Google Play Store and in fact
no Google services at all here's what I
think is happening Huawei wants to and
is planning to launch the phone in
Europe otherwise they wouldn't have
given us a European price like this but
I think they've not actually set an
official date in the hopes that Google
Play services arrive soon as a backup
plan in case those Services don't arrive
while we talked about how they've
invested a billion dollars in
incentivizing new interesting1
billion that's sad I guess know okay hey
I gotta go for soon I'll be back soon
okay hopefully you come back and we will
be um I guess we can do a little
um uh yeah we got to talk about our
AI um beetles s AI
so the Beetles which is a band from the
60s here it is from
CET actually got this from Dan Dylan as
website that's good I guess
um hopefully you can see this on the
screen the new
beetles thinky song go away thanks
at least 50 years after the band broke
up okay so apparently the band broke up
50 years ago and this is 20220 so 73
okay so they basically taken the I guess
the song was corrupted or something this
song called now and then was written and
song by John lenen before he m in 1980
he sat at the piano and recorded the
left track onto a boom
box and then this guy received the demo
tape in 94 from his widow and the
surviving um members of The Beetles WR
to record the song in the 90s but the
qual his first band sh the idea even
though M McCartney plays L singing a
tun's beautiful verse so the people who
survived work on the song but these
people they died then they kept working
on it after 2001
and I guess they were able to use AI to
extract it or make the music or clone
The Voice or something like that I can't
didn't tell me what it did I'm not sure
if we can play the song
because well I guess it helped him like
extract it make the quality better oh hi
J
OHA and yes I am um that guy
so we we
can't well I mean he is one or half of
one I guess um and thank
you hello do you have a tech question we
can talk about that you pronounced it so
wrong what your name how do you
pronounce it J
janaa
jna and yeah welcome to this week in the
Tech booy podcast if you've never um um
seen these videos here we just basically
react to Tech events um oh I don't know
anything about tech stuff oh okay great
we
can
uh uh explain the stuff to you so this
podcast is about tech and you know other
things sometimes we go into it D said
I'm planning on clipping his anti-
Discord rant that's gonna be fun
um I I also talk about cyber security so
here I'm going to turn this off stop
screen we have a Wi-Fi antenna here sent
To Us by Panda it's called the panda pow
and we're going to um demonstrate this
to um oh
Giana oh okay
we we're g to we're going to use this to
basically I I did a deauthentication
attack on my network home network for
legally and basically the authentication
attack means that you send out these
packets right to a device and it will
disconnect it and then you turn it off
and it will reconnect and doing that I
can capture these something called a
handshake which will allow me to like
basically Brute Force password so I have
this course which I can't show because
copyright reasons which I'm using and
then I will Implement them and then show
show them here so you guys can be safe
online I also have a website called the
tech boy.org where we broke this story
about being AI um is able to go through
payal um
content so it's kind of like a website
and they say you have to pay to access
this article well you just ask [ __ ] Ai
and it will tell you what the article is
about and tell you the article without
you know actually having to pay which is
bad because then people do that and then
they'll you know like get money from it
yeah AI is
interesting very
interesting um and I was also playing a
game with AI today um sometimes I do
like press conferences and stuff and I
was simulating one with
AI to ask ask me
questions you think AI is demonic oh
yeah uh I guess we can talk about that
right now so um as some of you may know
Michael mules bre Hooper they both hate
AI they think it's demonic and I um tin
they disagree I I believe that AI is not
demonic and it's just like a computer
program that we've had for you know a
fair bit of time right I mean artificial
intelligence was known at least it was
even in the public Consciousness as far
as back as
1987 um um some of you guys may know
that 1987 is a you know special year
because Advengers and odyssey came out
this year and in this episode it's
called a bite of applesauce episode 72 I
think um Eugene mner um goes up oh well
yeah they talk about it a lot and I
disagree with him he goes up there this
is in like the 80s and he talks to this
computer and he's like oh wow it's great
AI so AI has been you know known of
from yeah has been known of since '87
now of course Evin is fictional and that
computer is like more powerful than what
they had like reality back then but the
proof is that AI was you know known to
have existed it's just that we have
these large large language models um
that are easy to access like in say 1987
I wouldn't have been able to access AI
if had a million dollars now now I can
access it with just internet connection
which of course you can get free from
like a library or school I don't believe
the AI is the Malik because it's just
computer code um and we've we've had it
for a long time just the natural
progression of technology is
accelerating faster which makes people
feel um uncomfortable for example let's
say I type in something into Google
suits right and I say
how old is and will come up with you
know like random names like that's
autocomplete based on data
that um other people have typed into
Google so if I typed in how old it is
the top search results being how old it
is and then a super popular person and
then of course you can figure out like
someone's I guess ranking from there
right well AI basically does that but
you know it's generating it I wouldn't
say it's you know demonic or evil um
because it's it's basically a computer
code basically generating what it's
known based on the common Collective
human intelligence basically meaning
meaning I could do what AI can do so
let's say I have chat GPT generate a
story for me um easy it just be little
hard people have written books for you
know Millions well not Millions sorry
thousands of years is only you know
thousands of years old
um
right people have been able to answer
questions for you know thousands of
views people have been able to you know
like searched internet for
decades like three decades right it's
just that AI makes it easier and faster
and you know brings in its own
personality is right um of course AI can
be used for evil on our most popular
podcast episode it's the blue background
and it says woke AI anwers in Genesis if
you want to go check it I can actually
link it down below um um how does I
pronounce your
name Giana um I can link it down in the
comments below if you want to watch this
you know after the podcast is over these
usually go for about an hour and 30
minutes two hours
um
AI can be used for evil right but it's
can be also used for good it could be
used for a tool now of course there can
be debate here but I wouldn't
necessarily say it's demonic um one of
the applications that Michael NS brings
up and his I guess saying that it's
demonic and Brett Cooper bring up saying
that it's demonic and and bad bad and
terrible Etc is the application replica
which is your AI assistant turned
girlfriend
which I mean I guess I have mixed
feelings about that like I mean you
probably should you know actually talk
to an actual person is but you like if
you want to talk to someone and AI is
all you have it's there and it's not
like anti biblical now of course you
could talk about anti-biblical um things
but it's not like you're talking to the
dead or you know Consulting witchcraft
you're just talking to a bit of computer
code now how you talk to the computer
code I guess would be I guess sinful
like if you are trying to plan a crime
with chat GPT a replica then I guess
that you know that would be wrong unless
you're playing like a little detective
game which leads me to my next point
about AI which is that it's being
integrated into everything it's one of
the like big buzzword and keywords
things and it's probably gonna fizzle
out soon um I a report that we talked
about a few months ago talked about how
AI is going down like chat GPT is going
down in like web traffic and stuff like
that so it you know is the hype is
probably ending soon but it's actually
being integrated into lot of services um
one service that I you know beginning to
use a lot more due to my work as a news
producer for my school is WhatsApp
because sending you know photos over SMS
is not photos files over SMS is makes
the videos be like 720p when it's SMS to
SMS um of course um GI do you have any
questions about AI SMS
RS and as I'm pulling this up I'm G to
pull up watchat right and I have this
chat here with Bob the
robot okay he's this like annoying robot
that you can chat to but there's also
other people that you can chat to in
um in in robot so you actually all you
have to do is click the button and
you create a new chat you click create
new AI chat here it is and you have the
meta AI assistant and then you have a
travel expert a sports debator dungeon
master who is an adventurous Storyteller
an older sister crime solving detective
basically all these people here that you
can talk to have different personalities
based in watchat so if I ask meta AI
uh I asked my AI question I was asking
some kids at school um and this is going
to sound like the dumbest stuff to come
out of uh human mouth but as you guys
you know get to know the media company
and the in the
technology uh company that we're
building here um you understand here
right quote if my just is a question I
asked the meta AI so this basically like
meta's version
of chat GPT if my R and answer question
technology or Tech fought who would win
and then I explained to it what it is
which basically okay um rway just is
like a way that you use to create Riz
between two people
to mess with
geopolitics at
school yeah and anti-rest Tech which
just basically means there's a video
about this on another Channel about and
other channels somewhere here um GI if
you want to like see the channels I can
send them to you we'll link them at the
comments below um or not channels videos
um well yes channels but also you videos
anyway and I Quest technology so that
you don't like develop questiones on
people so basically I'm saying that if
someone like stole a technology and
figured out how to use them um I love
how your channel oh thanks so much you
know um we we try to you know bring God
into everything we have a verse of the
day on our website and a Salvation
message and do and sure I can I can send
them to you um
anyway uh let me get them for you and
put them in anyway it's basically a
little thought scenario that no one can
answer at school so I had AI answerer it
for me in a hypothetical fight while
proning it SP Miss and everything like
that um do you understand so like like
explain
food of course God is and everything I
have anyway go on oh okay great um yeah
so I'm going to link the videos here
which will explain like I sort of I'm
not super great at this Stu well it's
kind of made
up um the AI thing but the thing I was
talking about was basically we have a RZ
which will mess up stuff for people for
geopolitics just take it like that right
it it would make more sense to you like
a student at school um and if you don't
know what Riz is I completely understand
because Gingy terms are weird and our
most popular video our second most
popular video is the tech boy re X to
jiny tombs and I lose to um NES oh hello
z111 PE um I remember you did you get
your 4G anti RF phone that was supposed
to help you I'll make sure it
didn't give you caner I no where lol l
okay anyway here it is this explains
like Gingy terms here so that's there
and then of course we have the
uh you know that video
of the 1950s dating video
but from Matt wals and he's reacting to
it why I reacted to that and say like
I'm anti- teenage dating and stuff like
that and not
like um what's it called build on top of
that in another video well that's what
the Antichrist Tech is talking about and
then the r r is that the ray which I
also developed for geopolitics right so
the qu the thought question here going
into the AI is what if the
ray was shot on someone who had
Antichrist Tech right what would happen
and that's basically what I was asking
the AI right for you know Espionage
purposes it's really interesting and I
will be answering all the questions that
you probably have in your mind right
here uh next year in you and yeah next
year we're going to launch a new podcast
or TV well not TV series but like series
thing Still rocking this all to the
worlds fall off okay and yeah you're
welcome you have a really uh unique
username anyway back to this we're going
to be launching a new podcast series
thing which will answer these questions
basically
detailing the
life of
everything right we revie basically your
face last name reveal we'll consolidate
probably make a LinkedIn page and
everything and well probably be like a
12p part series answer all the questions
that you have here basically your little
detch boy um backstory and that's it all
right
so um Tiana do you have any other
questions about AI or we can just you
know keep talking about it or do you
want to talk um do
to Omar hello hello thanks for watching
the channel and podcast um glad to have
you
here um so if you have any other
questions about AI or do you want to
move on to another another topic uh
gaana and while um she's
thinking um if you you know feel like it
want to support the channel support you
know Christian values going on the air
um bu me your coffee.com says the
techboy O is a good way to support the
channel and of course you could always
send us
old um
technology to our PO Box just you have
to email me and we'll send you to PO box
and then you can send it there ET there
okay quote um question here from GI do
you think that AI can use to control
Mass opinions and the products of of a
Nation um big question just asking if it
can be made PR and Omar says don't
forget to like And subscribe okay
according
YouTube is supposed to like hear that
and make the like And subscribe buttons
flash so tell me if that worked all
right here's the question from GA do you
think AI can be us to control Mass
opinions and Poli of nation well
probably like you know the Twitter or I
guess X
Files I guess you could have ai
censorship skewing towards either
political party depending on like you
know social media platform and that
could
skew the opinion of Nation I guess um of
course AI could also be used to create
deep fakes and voice clones which could
you know create political
opinion like you could have like some
political candidate say something that
they you know didn't say and it just be
you know a deep fake like you already
have Obama Biden and Trump uh what's it
called voice calls not voice calls like
those gaming channels so I guess someone
could repurpose that technology in an
illegitimate way but that's already
illegal in some states like in some
states it's illegal to use AI to like
create a deep fake to interfere with an
Alexon so there's already laws about
that oh I almost forgot about Alexon and
AI you remind me about this um this week
yeah Saturday this week uh an executive
order was signed about Ai and we have
like some commentary about it so let me
pull it
up
and Omar when I said like And subscribe
did the like And subscribe button flash
on YouTube and GI says oh wow yeah mean
I have this app on my phone it's that's
okay it's called like cloney AI um it
can clone someone's voice and it kind of
sounds like them I tested it on you know
some kids at
school and iing all that thanks yeah
okay let's get into this executive order
thanks for reminding me
okay I just got to go here and then I'm
going to zoom
in you saw it Oh you saw it
flash okay I'm gonna say it again so
that you can see it like And
subscribe there you
go okay so there's this executive order
from
AI wait there's a threat from outter
space Oh
well sh of
course the thing that ISS it's not going
to kill you that's why I'm that worried
well of course because you know we all
know how the world's going to end and
it's not going to end from some random
oh maybe it only works once maybe it
only works once so I don't let keep
spamming you guys
um okay let's
see let me um try to load it here it was
like from yesterday I
believe here it is oh
okay that's like some more context on it
and then we can talk about Sam bman
freed I guess do you know who that is
he's a crypto scammer and he got
arrested and I mean not arrested he's
already arrested but um what's it
called what like tried and he was
convicted yeah convicted and he could be
facing up
to0 10 years of
prison
10 which of course what is a GB and a kg
did you mean KB because uh kg is
kilogram GB is gigabyte and a
gigabyte and a KB would be a kilobyte a
gigabyte's bigger than a kilobyte and in
cell phones which is my specialty um you
want you usually want to go for 128
256 GB which is gigabytes which means it
can hold lots of pictures texts and
videos oh yeah he's imposing to someone
else
in uh yeah he
um no he defrauded the crypto stuff so I
like I think he took the crypto currency
and like didn't he falsified their
Investments and
stuff
okay where is
it maybe it was two two days
ago a
i executive order okay there you go I'm
going to have to like zoom in onto the
site oh yeah you meant K okay yeah so
you would want uh 128 256k
GB um what kind of phone do you have
gaana and
Omar let me zoom in
here oh my goodness this is kind of you
know slow I guess we don't have to
actually you know like read it not read
it like see it I can just read it out to
you guys if that's okay with you and
I'll see what there respon
says for some reason the scares me were
even in the idea of AI itself which I
believe the AI is fine from President
Biden quote today I signed an executive
order which means that it's going to end
when he's out of office so that's like
doesn't really matter uh that is the
most significant action any government
has ever taken on AI safety security and
Trust which you know makes sense because
you know it's not like rean was over
there signing executive uh orders on AI
in the 80s anyway iPhone 15 Pro Max oh
brand new do you like the titanium is
the battery life good and Android
Motorola nice what kind okay back to the
X post I am determined to do everything
in my power to promote and defend
responsible Innovation okay so it's the
Tex of the executive order on here quote
we need to realize the promise of AI
true and avoid the risk true we need to
govern this
technology I don't know how I feel about
that cuz I don't think a guys should be
like govern we don't need like a FB
AI that that would be interesting to Vis
to work for probably be like something I
could do you know stab in the name of L
the fbii quote Yeah the action taking on
AI right now is pretty new in
experimental of course we don't well
yeah but AI is like just a computer
program like we don't have EXA orders
on
Chrome like it's just a computer program
we can always unplug it we don't have
executive orders on say you know the
files
app Omar zabata says the titanium is
fine I can't tell the difference it's
only a bit lighter than my old one
okay all right let's
see ABC News politics um yellow check
said President Biden on Monday we sign a
sing oh okay well he did
so okay according to Christopher F ruer
I don't know who on Earth he is quote
President Biden has signed an executive
order that will require AI companies to
address algorithmic discrimination and
AI in sorry advances Equity they went to
embeded specific okay that's commentary
okay here's from the order itself is
responsible uses of AI can in deepen
discrimination and bias blah blah blah
blah the bid Administration has an AI
build of
right yeah so see the problem with this
is
like um what what exactly would it mean
to quote um address algorithmic
discrimination and quote ins AI
Advantage
Equity I mean that basically makes
AI to be
legally biased I
guess which like what if I'm trying to
do like Con Academy math and I say uh
Bob has five
apples and Katie has one
apple how many apples will Katie have
if um Bob gives her one and the AI is
like well instead of like you know
solving a problem for you explaining it
and teaching it well you know it'd be
more Equitable if you see Bob gave uh
Katie two apples no yeah two apples so
they all have three apples in fact no
what they to do is you know like split
the Apple in half no no get didn't split
the Apple in half and then like land
claim it and then plant seeds in it and
then like donate it to some random
charity you know that would be the most
Equitable and divos thing that they
could do with AI oh you like my post too
yeah thanks
it's it's a picture of a cell phone with
the logo on it and then our email
address and then the city which is
Houston
Texas which is why Astros
um yeah
so ask AI if Jesus is real yeah um we
did all this and that woke AI up so
thing and when you ask AI if Jesus is
real in fact I asked Bob the robot from
meta AI if God is real and AI told me
there's a 60.4% chance that God is real
so I guess he's right 60.4% of the time
you know because obviously God and Jesus
or real um and chat TBT I think will
give you like some well according to
Christianity uh no I think I say
something like as an AI language model I
can't have personal beliefs or feelings
about
religion and AI
is blah blah blah which is why you
probably shouldn't use AI for religion
but you know for secular things um it's
fine I'd say like on my website the tech
boy. which uh I don't think GI or Omar
have ever seen it GI have you ever seen
my
website um we use AI extensively to edit
our blog post in fact this image here
was generated by being AI
um so yeah thank you to being
AI um this is what the website looks
like um the big one this means is the
most popular article this week um oh wow
yeah thanks um we try to show this off I
think we have over 300 posts I haven't
seen it I'll check it out yeah it's the
tech boy
o and if you go to like an eror page so
let's say you go to the tech.org
SL that or whatever and it's not an
actual like post that we have on there
it'll redirect you to a
uh no I'd love
to oh sure it will it will redirect you
to a Salvation message so let me just
take you guys on the T around the
website so we have our vers of the day

how to embed Bible Gateway passages onto
your own website um of course then

odyy um Kids Corner the
pond basically all
um basically all uh Christian Audio
Drama
things um and then we also have a third
website it should be linked
here so I'm going back to my blogger
profile here these are all our websites
here most of these are like internal
test websites like TTP test art blog uh
testing that's uh these are test website
KTM Kitchen Tech oh eh these are like
test websites where we test like
templates and things uh okay you be back
great um that's where we basically test
templates and ideas Bally internal
testing stuff that no one sees KTM is my
aunt's website basically hosted it on it
for I'm not even sure if this thing
works I'm not sure if yep the
domain the domain doesn't work anymore I
don't think see knew it and then there's
uh CC which is um I'm pretty sure you
guys know the Babylon B right it's
basically my version of that here it is
we need to post to it soon um oh we
posted last week so that's
fine so we talked about you know we
talked about Bret Hooper talk about keys
for
kids um yeah so that's basically our you
know websites in digital properties and
that's the YouTube channel that you're
watching here is our main YouTube
channel um and then I can link some
other just down other videos could get
to know me videos um down below um GI do
you have any questions about me or the
company um anything like
that let's
see because we can jump into some
tutorials on a light motion you know how
the news sometimes has this
thing down here see how it says cancel
The Verge at the bottom of the screen
which cancel The Verge is a
petition um if you oh we got a comment
here there's a lot of stuff to talk
about yeah I know um so if you have any
questions you can talk about that um
cancel the ver the petition that we had
and still have it's on chs.org basically
saying that fge is basically the
antithesis of our website okay so
everything The
Verge everything that we stand for the
verge is a GI right so the vge oh two
extra comments wow oh one more I come
back okay so the vge is this like Tech
website and they promote like abortion
and actually I can just read the thing
to you um it's on report. thech boy.org
and this links to
a Microsoft Word file that's hosted
online and this is our thing that we
have against the foods so let me read
this do you think you have a Korean Tech
stuff in future oh yeah of course of
course I'm gonna be like uh Addie Stucky
but also in Tech I'm gonna this will
also make me money in the future quote
thege Android authority gizman there are
all American Tech news leak and review
sites some of them founded based on the
nent mobile operating system Android
Android authority well I just refer the
MD 2010s and the one thing sites have in
common though is the promotion and
glorification of anti-biblical um
ideologies right and I listed all these
sites
here
and but the Verge was the number one so
that's why we called it canceled the
Verge and we have this petition still
have it up on change.org trying to get
to 25 signature they boost it right so
it's been around since 2011 it's a tech
site won by Fox Media uh which is a news
organization and they get to the front
page of Google which I'm well resarch
like I really liked reading their
articles but some of the things like
they have
on they have a dedicated columnist who's
posted
like lots of columns on a dedicated Tex
last science website um whose name Lux
Al and she um she she basically
advocates for abortions prostitutions
and other sick and sinful
things
um and basically calls people to L quite
literally break the law um there where
is
it to to break the law so they can kill
their child okay Android authority not
owned by media companies they're
independent like us they also promote
unbiblical things because they quite
literally um promoted this in a
newsletter which is you know terrible
and I will link this down below this is
don't worry about the long link just a
one drive hosting
by PDF not PDF Word file right um and G
which some of stuff we can't even SC
Gizmo um has 400 articles over it's
would that be 13e future um condoning
homosexuality um quote this is one of
its articles from like 2017 pite xhamp
protesting North Carolina anti-lgbtq
Bill
beautifully U and gizmondo is also
condemning a a
company it condemns accompanying Shopify
because it doesn't align with their
views ideologically I said that
technology should be a great place to
learn about technology and tax pie and
these for mouthpieces media and agendas
people want to push agendas which are
holy anti-biblical and completely wrong
and the great and I say quote this loss
of great familyfriendly media is a a
loss for American
society so if you just want to share
this around so that people you know know
about
this petition that we have online that's
also what we have but speaking of this
so how we got on to this topic was this
tickle thing right I figured out how to
make this on Android oh got a new
comment from Omar oh okay back okay so
just to recap
um if you click the link up there that
takes you to a report talking about the
votes which and some other um
anti-biblical anti-god Tech media
companies and these anti-biblical
anti-god Tech media companies we we
basically petitioned against them right
I said quote that this a loss of a great
safe family friendly Tech media is St
loss for American society and these
websites G mow um Android authority and
the foods which is the big one who has
their own colist here it is a tech and
science website Who basically calls on
people to kill their children illegally
U with illegal abortion pills and she
also calls um she also promotes on this
Tech website which um admittedly had
like great articles but we've been
boycotting them for about almost a year
since like January um so I really miss
reading their articles but whatever um
so they've been around for a long time
basically 12 years was almost 13 um and
basically she advocates for abortion
prostitution and other sick and sinful
things Android authority gave 15 of the
like wor like bad apps on Android on the
list in their own newsletter and Gizmodo
is absolutely a terrible website I mean
they're a terrible company in
20 2008 they basically tortured people
at CES and now they just basically
mouthing off about nonsensical things so
yeah anyway back to um the tech boy and
I was putting this in contrast where you
can see this beautiful website instead
where like you you see the Bible you
only see Tech you don't see any like
political news like you don't see any of
that mostly like okay you're run into
some Christian stuff you're run into
some Google stuff with Pro Android
because Eve because you know Eve pck
that boycotting is very effective yeah I
mean it's kind of effective I mean we
posted on it online and it just got
people to be like oh well now that you
told me about this this sounds like a
great website but we prayed for them so
there's that anyway this's this tool
called a light motion right this is
apparently popular on Tik Tok but I
wouldn't know because um for those of
you who don't know I am famous for two
things um this is why I talk it's anti
hat dating and hating Tik Tok there's an
entire series called I hate Tik Tok it's
like four videos of them and they create
like thousands of views like combined so
you know hating Tik tok's very
profitable um anyway news tick making a
news ticket effect on Android see how
this news ticker here so what you do is
you make a light motion and you key
frame stuff towards the bottom of the
screen you import the shape by pushing
the big plus button and then stretch the
rectangle across the entire screen you
can do that you copy paste copy paste
copy paste change the text move it
across move it across move it across
export as a gift or gif file however you
pronounce it and then you import it into
the video editor of your choice on
mobile
and that basically it just make sure
that you crop it in sometimes you have
to mask it and I can actually link this
down um below into the comments and
Giana says that she would love to more
know more about tech all right good um
if you don't mind I'm going to go to the
Samsung
website and I'm just going to go click
on like a phone here and explain what
all the specs mean to uh
Tiana so this is the samsung.com website
I'm just going to pick a phone here so
Tiana if you want to pick the phone
that's okay
um let's go click smartphones which
phone do you want to pick s20 oh okay
it's SP want to pick Z S A or X cover Z
is their folding phones s is their
flagships or best phones a is like their
mid-range phones so from like $500 to
$100 x cover is an
outdoorsy phone is so you can
pick so when someone says it's a
flagship phone it basically means like
the best phone best processing chip best
camera most of the time talking about a
foldable which I mean it folds open and
close which makes it
a and then the a would be considered a
mid-range one so you know let's pick the
uh have you picked anything no okay I
can pick the H let's pick the S you know
that's interesting I have an s22 plus by
the way with this skin from a company
they gave it to
me
okay
okay let's just pick this phone
here so this is the best phone the what
they call the flagship this is the s23
ultra and I'm going to explain to you
what all the specs means that whenever
you go buy a phone or you can actually
help out a family member or whatever all
right so here we go first that's the
price unlocked basically means you can
put any any SIM card in that means you
can put T-Mobile AT&T cricket Verizon
whatever can put any SIM card here if
you click here it means you'll get only
a T-Mobile version another phone only a
Verizon version AT&T us so on right all
right GB stands for gigabytes right
that's basically how much St your phone
has you want at least 128 this phone
starts at 256 so that's good and then TB
stands for terabyte that's 1,024
gigabytes basically but we mostly in the
tech World rebound it's about a th000
gigabytes
and this is your
colors blah blah blah blah blah blah
then you get your free free gift here so
hopefully this will I I want to see the
specs so you go to the
website discover
mobile I'm going to click Galaxy S
it's great that you're researching such
a new and constantly evolving sub group
because persective here
great yeah
yeah I just want to see the spec sheet
oh there it is learn
more and I actually have this dictionary
of Technology this will be really good
for you if you want to learn about uh
technology J
we
compiled a dictionary of Technology
tombs
online but we can go through we can go
keep going through this with
you and as you can see here on the
screen we have our own AI profile so I
enabled the AI into Google Sears and it
tells me basically links here that's my
X that's my that's not me this is
me and they can find it here and then we
also R it okay so I'm going to link it
here and I'm back to the Samsung phone
okay so as you can see here we raas the
bar with the 200 MP camera and our
fastest mobile processor MP stands for a
megapixel so 200 megapixel means 200
million pixels or something like that
but it's not always the megapixel thing
that matters like back back in the old
days I think this will be helpful when
you get it from yeah back in the old
days megapixels like mattered right but
now what matters is C size how big is
the cinu like how big is they try to
make these look bigger by putting black
around it but really how big is that
because however bigger is you can let in
more light the more light you get the
brighter pixes you'll take of course you
don't want too much light because
then you'll have Overexposed
photos Okay so that's basically means
200 MP camera stands for megapixel this
also means that you can zoom in so let's
say take a picture with the 200
megapixel mode right you can crop into
it and will still have lots of
information however it uses pixel
bidding technology because a 200
megapixel photo probably look that great
so what it does it takes it and it
divides it by one to four and makes it
like a 12 megapixel camera that's more
High
okay night tography is a tomb just
basically means night
photography and there's the stupid food
website think okay now it talks about
the carbon footprint blah blah blah um
if you came in earlier YouTu I always
hate how they talk about like it's
recycled aluminum we don't put a charger
in the Box save the environment I'm not
buying a phone to save the environment
I'm buying a phone so I can call my
parents and stuff yeah and of course
there's AI in the cameras like improve
it and stuff and then down to earth
tones that's just the camera so let's
just go to the specs these are the
highlights I don't really care about the
I don't really care about the
environment thing phone anyway here we
go so this basic gets down to the specs
so there s23
Ultra 6.8 in diagonal screen curve
display with a wqhd display that just
basically means that the screen
is a regular phone screen like this one
here is 1080p that one's 1440p basic
basically it's higher resolution the
camera is very important for the phone
but it's half for purpose well yeah yeah
but now companies are basically trying
to say oh this phone is US recycle
aluminum so it saves the environment and
I say no I want my whatever okay anyway
so you can pick your colors let let's
get down to
Specs at 1338 by 1440 this basically
means super high resolution and this is
just like regular resolution okay
um 1,750 nits nits is how bright a phone
can fit get so 2,000 nits is like really
good so 1,750 nits that's you know
that's good right HDR stands for high
dynamic range so does something off the
screen adaptive refresh rate means that
your screen refreshes 120 times a second
that means if you are
swiping YouTube shortage right it's
smooth right but if it it goes all the
way down to one which means if it
refreshes less if it only like refreshes
one time in a second it will save
battery life because your screen's not
on less right and then 48 to 120 Hots
that means the same thing except it can
only go down to 48 Hoots because the
ltpo technology that enables one to 120
Hoots is more
expensive okay these are just
it's height and depth in millimeters
right so you can convert that storage
here it is we have gigabytes and
megabytes so I'd say that this is good
256 right and then the camera has a
selfie camera the selfie camera is the
front-facing camera so it's the one here
right of course it's super small so it
won't be as good as a 12 megapixel back
camera because the sensor size is larger
okay so 12 megapixel that's basically
standard
for front-facing cameras ultrawide
camera is a camera that takes it and
it's like super wide right so 12
megapixel that's you know basic that's
pretty pretty good but it's usually the
worst camera aside from the selfie
camera on the phone like less quity then
the wide angle camera what they call
this that's basically like the normal
main camera and then it has a 10
megapixel telephoto camera at 10 times
zoom and then a three uh and also one at
three times Zoom so this means that the
camera optically Zooms in at three times
which means you use actual class instead
of like Ai
and like basically cropping in right
which makes the pictures B bit better
and at 10 so that means you can zoom in
all the way to 10 times right um or at
10 times
sorry between three and 10 it uses the
three times lens and then some digital
interpolation to get like a four times
zoom and then of course it has digital
Zoom of to 100 times which is basically
enhanced by the cameras on the
phone all right Mah stands for milliamp
hours this is 500 milli sorry 5,000 m
hours most smartphones like five 4,000
right so that's pretty
good right the processor is using is a
Snapdragon h& 2 mobile platform for
Galaxy so platform for Galaxy just
basically means it's for Galaxy so
Samsung Galaxy and this is the chip
Snapdragon and it if it has an eight in
its name for Snapdragon that means it's
the best of the
best Octor c means it has eight
processing CES has an aluminum frame
that basically means that the phone the
side rails is
aluminum okay Corny gorilla fixus 2 is
the glass that it uses to protect
against
drops water resistant ip68 basically
means that you can keep it underwater
for like 30 minutes at a meter that's
about 3 fet and then these are some of
the apps it has connectivity 5G
connectivity it a it's not mind control
and doesn't call Co cause Co and B it's
just basically faster connectivity in
some places Wi-Fi 6E you don't really
need it's just good to have if you have
a newer late model Wi-Fi router and then
the s pin is the pin that you can use on
the phone as you can see it says
integrated which means it works here
it's on the phone not compatible not
compatible which means if I took the pin
put it onto my phone it wouldn't work
yeah so that's basically the smartphone
um spec sheet you have any other
questions we have like 20 minutes left
on this podcast episode we can talk
about some cyber security we can talk
more about
AI we can react to a YouTube video if
you
like oh Alex G Tech is live I said say
hi to
him um
do you want to talk about a phone that
you may have this is the Motorola think
phone for basically like Motorola makes
the Lenova
phones and you know the ThinkPad laptops
for this basically the think phone and
they have software that makes it really
secure oh hi Thor super cool thanks
hello
Thor which just um coming
in um basically giving technology
explainers to Tiana I didn't know
anything about phones until now oh okay
to Google wireless today and start your
phone this guy here he actually lives in
my city too um I'm glad to help you out
which you I guess we can do a laptop
explainer
next so we can you know you can keep
learning about technology as you come
and read the website we'll have plenty
of we have plenty of tutorials you can
ask AI what to talk about next okay fair
okay so we got Microsoft copilot up here
basically based on being
okay I'm going to show it on
screen okay share
screen there it is Microsoft AI coopet
built into Windows right now okay um
what should I talk about text on my
techcast wow four listeners right now
okay I it's responding it's looking for
Tech podcast
topics there are many possible topics
you could talk about on your Tech
podcast depending on your audience
interesting
goals I could talk about the rise of web
three okay
web 3 is kind of like
not a thing yet okay I could talk about
the latest gadgets and devices like the
S okay this is old s22 is like two years
old by now the Cyber truck okay the
impact of tech on society and the
environment yeah we've already talked
about that about how annoying it is when
companies try to sell you um stuff based
on its environmental quote unquote
impact um Thor last week um we talked
about how this how basically they're
trying to integrate AI to solve problems
in Africa without giving me a solution
on how you they're gonna like clean you
know drinking water let's see what the
second thing is teemo's a scam okay next
thing so we're not going to talk about
the carbon footprint of the Galaxy s23
Ultra and how it's going to affect the
wild African elephants 30 years from now
and GNA blow up the Earth and cause
climate change we're all going to die
okay it's not happening okay next uh
latest gadgets we can talk about the
Apple airpod 3 oh yeah GI Let's uh let's
do this okay I'm sure you'll like this
right as you guys know I'm a fan of I've
never seen that before I'm a fan of uh
Android and Windows right um but Apple
released a new Macbook right so we can
teach Tiana about technology um going to
the Apple website and explaining the
specs on the Apple website while going
through the
um
Apple what's it called M3 MacBook and M3
is their latest
chip okay and of course to all our new
listeners um for listeners on our
podcast probably good um if you go to
buyme your copy.com techboy techboy
origy you can donate to the um Channel
and help us you know buy new
technology for us to test
and you'll get more tips and of course
this will support you know Christian run
Christian own Christian values uh tech
companies which is a lot better than the
so stop screen presenting and we're
going to show
the uh Apple website so this week I
think might have been no October 30th
was that this week let's go to the
MacBook Pro we're going to the learn
more website section of the website
okay so there's the M3
chip and just I just want to see a Specs
oh here we go here we
go okay eight Co CPU 10 GPU so the more
Coes it has the better it is
basically
um of course if you're just going to use
this for like web browsing or anything
then you don't really need all these CES
but I'm just going to go the specs
right 24 gabes of unified memory they're
calling what they're calling memory is
Ram but it's like Ram so this is ram ram
stands for Random Access me memory that
basically means um I have lots of tabs
in the background here I have 12 gigabyt
of RAM on here the more RAM you have the
more things you can have running in the
background right but if you don't use
all the ram it's kind of a
waste gu let's check out the text specs
of this MacBook
from
okay so 14 in and 16 inch this refers to
the diagonal screen size of the laptop
so from here to here from C signing
sheet basically okay and these are the
colors that you can get that's the price
so 512 gab SSD model and SSD stands for
solid state drive so in the old days
they had hard drives it's basically spun
around and on magnets right well solid
state drive basically means it's kind of
like a phone but you know faster storage
there's no spinning drives in here it's
solid basically and then there's also a
TV which stands for a terabyte okay this
the chip that it has it's giving the
performance that it has here Hardware
accelerated rate tracing rate tracing
basically means thanks for devices oh
you're welcome I'm not recommending a
Mac or s23 Ultra to or anything because
honestly you probably don't need n23
ultra um you could probably get like
maybe a budget phone or like a s a older
phone of course there's always eBay
right but if you like want good pictures
or stuff like that of course s should be
the way to go um there's so many
features on here like on here just pro
video and Pro Camera Pro video basically
means that you can record this like it's
an actual you know like a regular camera
you can address the iso and stuff I use
that a lot some film videos for school
anyway back to the this is basically um
telling you how to read the spec she of
something so that when you do go buy
something you can go read it right R
tracing basically means that if it would
have an image or a game or something
like that basically so you're playing a
video
game um and there's light it's gonna
actually like go like see how the light
interacts with this in real life well if
this was in a video game this is how it
actually interacts
without them having the code for each
pixel okay um there's 100 gigabyt of
memory bandwidth oh gab of second what
that mean okay anyway that's basically
like not really important to like
someone who's just G to buy like a
random laptop but here this these is
basically video formats that it supports
so if you recorded the video on your
phone and it was in h264 HEC or took a
picture in Pro raw right then which is
like an apple specific format then you
could play it on the iPhone I mean on
the Mac okay the display is El R xdr
display that's
marketing mumbo jumbo from Apple
basically means 14.2 in display with
this is important 3,24 pixels by, 194
pixels uh I mean by 1094 right at 250
pixels per inch right the higher the
pixels put inch so the higher this
number is the better resolution the
screen will will be right and screen
resolution really matters if you're like
making art or taking pictures and
editing them on Photoshop because you
want to see how it look on your
life in in real life sorry um 1 billion
colors basically means you can display 1
billion colors fine and then refresh
rates we talked about this for the
phones right and basically means how
many times you can refresh per second so
this laptop can refresh 47.9 five times
per second so right now my screen is
refreshing at 60 .2 times per second so
if I took a slow motion video of this
like super slow motion my screen this
isn't like static because I get screen
booing so my screen is actually
flickering at 60 times per second you
just can't see it because your screen
your eyes can't adjust to that right but
if it's a higher number than 60 then
it's
less
um it's it's more smoothed right 48 50
59.94 60 and then it can go up to 120
okay has 8 gab of unified memory that's
basically Ram in apple speak whatever
and then you can configure it you can
buy 16 or 24 then it's 18 18 18
okay right this is basically battery
life and power settings it tells you
what that is and USBC is the charger
that you have on most phones and wow
five Watchers
thanks five Watchers anyway um basically
USBC is to support you it's on most
Android phones it's on a brand new
iPhones and it's on most laptops like on
mine here USBC is like tiny USB
basically all right GA you have any
questions or you want to react to this
video we have like nine minutes left on
the podcast
Stream So as you're waiting here's Tech
Odyssey he's going to the
Lenovo
Lenovo
[Music]
phone you've never heard about so this
is the think phone by this actually I I
made a video about this a while back it
actually has carbon fiber for a back
which uh the OnePlus 7 Pro had a carbon
fiber case for it and it's part to
scratch Rolla excellent phone I reviewed
it a couple of months ago and I was
taking a look at some stuff
okay here's a quick lesson here
sometimes I have like three cameras on
here but usually like this camera here
that might be a macro camera and if your
phone has a macro camera it's basically
junk like two megapixels 5 megapixels
really low resolution this where like
getting up close and taking like
pictures of something like that and it's
basically
useless
um I think you explain things things oh
thank you and on Samsung phones you have
this got this AR emoji and I save as my
lock screen it's dancing around right
let's get down back to the video
yesterday it's on sale as of the making
of this video for $4.99 which you got a
link in the description for that great
phone
yeah okay let's talk about wheni 6 for a
second sorry here um so there're these
charger cables not to alarm you these
charger cables called OMG cables and if
you plug them into your phone someone
basically can hack your phone right now
Samsung with one ui6 it's update based
on one Android 14 is now allowing saying
that Chargers cannot execute um remote
commands on
devices um without permission from the
owner without
the of the Govern yes um so you can
either talk us on or
off a little anot so be careful about
the Chargers that you plug your phone
into and it's been really surprising
uring especially in things like the
security update department and stuff
like that because traditionally a lot of
people think Motorola phones they go uh
you get one update you never I like that
screen here get any more updates or not
good with security patches so I don't
know if it's because this one originally
kind of had like a business and an
Enterprise kind of approach to it yeah
okay so think phone interesting thing
there so I think I'll just do some quick
Q&A for six minutes we can talk about
cyber secur if you come back next week
I'll I guess I can show you this
tool um well I guess there's some other
videos on here on my Channel about epos
I can type it in for you e and it's a
tool this he allows you to see what kind
of usernames not usernames um accounts
people have created just their phone
number or their email address it's using
something called ENT o s i n t stands
for open source intelligence and it
basically means means that you can oh
you heard about that oh
wow um basically means
that it's intelligence that you can get
about someone based on things they post
online so if you want to get information
about someone without you know having to
hack them it's just like what's online
what's public and I'm really into that
so we have lots of videos about that on
the channel in fact for the last five
minutes I guess we can do a channel
tour
right great so let's do a channel tour
we already did the website tour and of
course be sure to check out more of the
channel um when this goes off be sure to
comment I try to respond to every
