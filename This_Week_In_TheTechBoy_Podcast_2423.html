<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 2423</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
and here we are today welcome to the
this week in the tech boy podcast and I
am so excited for today's episode I
found some new clips and I'm just really
excited for today so let's get down to
business with our first website overview
Samsung release the Samsung Galaxy S2
degree Series today I'm going to tell
you what I think I'm wearing these
headphones they're not really synced up
to the audio anything
um these I got from Galaxy tech review
and I want to tell you about how they
are and how they feel I've played with
them around I bring them to school I use
them a lot so I think I'm pretty well
versed in howdy sound
um and yeah Samsung impact all right so
first starting things off well with an
all Samsung uh week this week so we had
things I'm excited about for the s23 and
I was excited to see that Snapdragon
agent 2 chip and new battery
improvements
um
so yeah that's nice the s23 series when
they did launch on Samsung unpacked
February 1st was kind of underwhelming
but you know the battery improvements
did come to speed Improvement sitcom but
you know it's a year to year of upgrades
it's more like an s22s so yeah it's the
same criticism as we had for Apple then
I had the s23 first impressions in which
I was like it's a great great phone nice
whatever
um I like the new AI features 8K Xbox I
like the emphasis that Samsung was
putting it on the features that you
already have like expert raw the the
customization that you can do on your
phone Samsung already is trouncing Apple
on features they need to show off what
they have here you know they need to
solve some more deck stuff that would be
nice so yeah they need to show off decks
they need to show off secure for secure
folder they need to show off all the
customization features the Galaxy store
Samsung internet bxp all the features
that make Samsung Samsung and makes
Samsung unique if Samsung's just like oh
we have great cameras I mean that's a
bunch of great cameras I'm thinking
about Apple uh Huawei which isn't here
in the US but abroad um Google like
Samsung is unique because of their
special software features so that's what
Samsung needs to do and I'm glad that
they started sewing that here and they
really need to start showing off some
decks more but at least they haven't
killed it yet so that's good all right
um s23 I said s23 would be a small phone
of the year uh they might face some
competition from the Asus phone if they
release one this year but I think
Samsung has agent too in here so it's
super powerful like new gaming level
performance right it can play any game
you throw it at maybe some gameplay
that some
a little faster frames a little faster
touch response Etc but I mean you have
the basics you got 120 huge screen you
got uh probably decent cooling good
battery life
um and on top of that it has better
cameras than the average gaming phone
it's smaller than the average gaming
phone it doesn't have all those lights
and it's uh lighter than the average
gaming phone and since it's Samsung it
has more accessory support than the
average gaming phone so yes Samsung
really good job on the s23 this year I
think it would be a good feeling because
it has a good battery life good camera
and it's a good small phone size for
those who want it so that's why I think
that it will be there and also with the
Samsung software features such as Dex
one UI it's great you can record 8K 38
frames per second and you know it's made
out of eco-friendly materials because
it's great for not having a charger in
the box and being made out of a cycle
fish nets and Bottles so fun and
egocentric I don't care put a charger in
the Box I paid 800 for the phone and I
need a charge in the Box okay
I don't care that your phones made out
of cycle business and microplastic okay
I really don't care okay like I'm not
gonna upload it because it's made out of
motorcycle materials I don't care all
right and now on to our next segment of
the day but we're going to talk about
selfie Studios
all right so selfie studios here it's
actually called Selfie World Houston
it's permanently closed and let's go
watch this reaction clip to why it may
be permanently closed it says a day in
the life of a selfie Studios employee
all right so you're like what what are
you talking about so we're gonna rewind
a little bit to that downl
so here we go
that's the most boring dumb video I've
ever seen
foreign
you may take us to downgrade from the 40
megapixel that was on the s22 also last
year but apparently it has better color
accuracy that's that's great intercoins
did not not to be uh NTB nothing but
Tech uh it has better dynamic range the
back cameras
laughs
all right so that was a great clip there
so
um I'm gonna go over here and see what
Sophie world does and is and let's have
this conversation I'm with the opinion
some people to kind of like probably
dumb probably but you know what do you
think do you think people should have to
pay money to take selfies and random
uh uh like stuff here what do you guys
think would you pay money to take
selfies at selfie world and apparently
it's an actual building so people did
but I mean you can probably green screen
on the phone nowadays so
like would you selfie
would you guys selfie uh
selfie World building
tell me guys in the comments what you
think tell me what you think
selfie world so yeah
and now
um on to our next and
oops I forgot about this segment I have
to talk about my headphones so yeah
let's talk about these headphones that
I'm wearing here as you can see them
here here's the mc100
um so let me put up that website here it
is mc100 headphones uh here they are
they have a 50 millimeter driver uh they
retail for forty dollars uh close back
headphones they say that they're
comfortable and have good sound and I
would say yeah they do have good sound
I've heard a little bit of music here
but I'm over YouTube on your drama guy
as some of you guys may know and I think
it's really nice um they do get kind of
uncomfortable but that's part of course
whatever they have uh they don't have a
microphone on here but they do have foam
on the inside of these and they fold all
over the place like this
they use a normal 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack but mine came in the box
with 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
uh 6.5 millimeter headphone jack adapter
box
what it looks like the sound sounds
pretty good on here not really much of a
sound expert but uh that's the tip here
uh not pretty much my sound expert but
you know they sound good in my opinion
like I said 50 millimeter driverless
good design and they also said that
they're very doable and I can say that
I've used these I've taken them around
school and put them in backpack side up
the cable he has a thread or lost
connection or anything
um you do have to really push it into
that headphone jack
um
but yeah this is great first impression
I think these headphones are good I
think they're nice no microphone though
and they are very durable so thanks for
watching and enjoy the rest of the show
where I will splice this in somewhere
else
previous uh sorry last segment of the
day
[Music]
another day
I wanted to show off this great uh
website called
gotquestions.org just taking a bit of
time so there you go
load there's like a Bible search engine
you can ask a question if it's not there
you can see if you can ask questions so
there's even a random question can you
can even search for the new questions so
you know if you have a need to use got
questions that work to find an answer to
a Bible app use a question use that
number it is a mobile application but
I'm a fan of the desktop version here
better than mobile applications I think
good in my opinion
um so like if you have a question you
can need to see here
um you can search here
um
let's say like
they even tell you about themselves uh
like they have a YouTube channel I think
uh why you should trust them about them
etc etc etc so guys if you need
um answers to Bible questions got
questions that look is a good Tech
resource for you all right that's all
for now talk to you later bye</pre>
