<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 8324</h1>
<pre>hi guys I think I have a new catchphrase
now weird is not wrong hello and welcome
to the tech boy This Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast all right so everybody um weird
is not wrong it's probably going to be
my new catchphrase right after or before
crushes are a threat to National
Security which I guess it actually is
you can go see yesterday's video about
that um but we're going to get right
into this so this is company called
friend who recently uh launched a
trailer um for the new artificial
intelligence um best friend product that
releases uh send notifications um to to
you um actually trying to get Tob on
your phone more instead of less which I
mean thank you
because you know maybe we said actually
want to use the devices that we
have but uh whatever so the domain is
friend.com and some people Christians
that you know I like are attacking them
on really shaky really Shaky Ground so
let's let's watch their ad here then
we'll get into the uh reactions from the
Christians and then my reactions um from
them again and then I guess we'll do
reactions back on to the new and what I
like to call terrible trous horrible
build it's probably going to get past
the children's Online safety act which
should be called the children's online
surveillance act here we
go oh
it's my service with mint has been
amazing there is no issue switching over
from here we go
breath we made
it so the friend is this as mkbhd's
podcast team put it this Necklace about
a size of a big a
[Music]
tech I don't know how to wo very
good also the sound effects there very
bad okay you only get those kind of
haptics and vibrations from 200 sub
Android phone um and
iPhone that's
fair all right let's
go let me show you how to game bro okay
oh come on come on oh let's go
serious come on man I hate this
game take notes baby oh man you guys
suck bro you look like the back let's go
let's go dude what how
[Music]
I know the effects are
crazy it's dank I could eat one of these
every
[Music]
day sorry I got you
messy it's really nice up here how'd you
find this
place I don't know I just kind of like
to come up here to be by
myself I've never brought anybody else I
me besides her she goes everywhere with
you right
M guess I must be doing something right
though I guess so we'll
see so this product is getting blasted
online oh wow we already got some
comments let's see what they're
saying oh hello and hello let me make
some my audio is working again let's
just check that test test okay good the
audio is actually working okay so this
product is getting blasted online okay
and some people actually told me the
tech blogger to stay out of the
discussion so um let's address these
claims here okay so first of all people
are blasting this product online with
the poll from Bible bash podcast which
um had almost 2,000 views and
85.8% % of people said it's wrong for
Christians to have ai friends and 99.9%
of people one of them being me said yes
and the other
4% just had the two little standard
random responses that they like to do
okay um so first of all as you guys may
know Bible B podcast is this podcast
that goes around and that pulls
questions with random questions that no
one and I mean no one has ever
considered D in their life ever okay all
right and and the thing is I don't
understand why you're attacking this
product friend from a Christian
perspective okay I've read the Bible
cover to cover and this product uh AI
friends are not mentioned in there okay
and you may be in the Bible okay using
them or not using them as a sin it's not
mentioned in the bible okay I guess you
could say it's becoming an idol but that
could be anything so that kind of ripes
out off the Slate second of all
um for the people who are saying that
it's uh causing humans to lose
interaction with other humans I didn't
told the question back at them what do
you have to say about pet of course I do
expect this to become a Bible P podcast
question in the next 24 hours after they
hear this they're probably gonna ask
questions is it a sin to have pets all
right second of all third of all
actually sorry um there are 1,000 one
million one billion things way more
important then an artificial
intelligence necklace that's cost $99
and only works with iPhones for now that
Christians could be talking about this
literally thousands millions exactly
there we go exactly thousands millions
billions of problems that can be solved
uh in the world I have no idea why we're
sitting around here talking about an
artificial intelligence necklace uh as
potential sin like um there's other
things that you guys need to be
addressing right and then I told the
people we is not wrong and they told me
quote youed should take a step back from
this when and consider why older people
might disagree with you they may see
something that you are blind to due to
your lack of life experience and to that
I say I'm a tech blogger it's my job and
also I'm your only opposition from the
Christian side okay if I just like T
took a step back here y all would be
trying to ban these a artificial
intelligence friends I can just I can
just wait for the Matt wal podcast
episode he's going to be like this is a
dystopian future and let me tell you all
these like Christian people who don't
really have backgrounds in technology
like uh Michael nolles Matt
walls Bible bash podcast these people
don't really have backgrounds and you
know technology they've gotten their
Tech predictions completely wrong okay
the iPad commercial video like that was
completely overblown and overrated okay
you reacted to that the uh Brett Cooper
hand scanning video where it's going to
be the second coming of the Antichrist
um yeah if theology is wrong because um
the the mark of the beast is it's going
to be a mark okay so is saying all the
Christians that don't get raptured so uh
get all their hands cut off I don't see
how that works the um the quote theion
future um camera on your face screen uh
Apple Vision Pro um when's the last time
you've seen someone walking on the
streets and app Vis
pro at all like I want everyone in the
chat or the com to raise their hands and
tell me how many people you've actually
seen legitimately have an apple Vision
Pro yeah no one okay and now the AI
friend thing which is not a sin you know
how we know that's not a sin because if
it was a sin companies like focus on the
family wouldn't be promoting that in
their audio dramas congratulations for
your thousandth episode adventures an
Odyssey by literally putting kids in
virtual reality of in the imagination
station in Lal
1988 okay or having people go into a
gigantic friendship simulation software
program in 20 and 24 which apparently I
guess friendship using software to um
improve friendships works in the the
Audio Drama space just not so in real
life unless of course you know Virtual
Technology works better than technology
that I have here 1980s technology maybe
not 2024 technology maybe
anyway
okay the the Bible bash people you know
maybe focus on the family da Shon might
have an article about this Matt W arle
about this video about this they're
going to be completely wrong on this
topic okay and great the friend deserves
a good attack okay I'm not saying the
friend is an utter and complete scam and
we're GNA get into that but I have I
have no idea why we're attacking this
from a chrisan perspective we should not
be there is no verse in the Bible that
says this is wrong okay weird is not
wrong okay I took the Babylon be weird
versus not weird quiz nice s weird
uh it doesn't make me wrong okay word is
not wrong okay there's nothing wrong
with autal intelligence friends and
second of all some people are calling to
bring bullying back because then bozos
like this guy I'm paraphrasing here
would not create stupid products like
this okay I hope I don't have to go into
detail on why we should bring bullying
back so that people don't use innovation
this is capitalism okay look you want to
bring bullying back and stifle
Innovation for ideas that you don't like
move to Soviet watch invent a Time ma
scine Go Back 40 years okay um second of
all so honestly I I have no idea why
we're criticizing this this is this is
absolutely ridiculous okay we could
criticize this from a technical
perspective but we shouldn't criticize
this from a theological perspective
because let me tell you there's nothing
in the Bible that condemns using an
artificial intelligence friend necklace
think okay unless of course you went the
Bible pass rout and said mention where
necklaces or something like that all
right but from a technical perspective
here's what I have to say to that uh the
device that is the most dumb device I've
ever seen in my life but it might do
well okay first of all okay it limits
its user base to iPhone users only which
is
ridiculous completely totally and
utterly ridiculous okay because honestly
a product like this should be marketed
too and for Android users who are
actually statistically alienated from
the general population just because of
the phone that they have okay 97% of
jiny 87 something per of JY about 90% of
JY wants an iPhone or has an iPhone um
that's why we have the team 13 which is
133% of JY that does want Android or
have an Android not an iOS phone
right um teens are actually you can go
look it up
bullied in bullied into having iPhones
or out of group chats and stuff like
this because some kids don't want to use
WhatApp or something like this right so
they so statistically speaking a person
who has an iPhone is probably going to
have more friends than a person who has
an Android phone statistically speaking
at least in the United States of America
right um even if when you get into your
20s and you mature right some people
actually have dating preferences that
they only have an iPhone guess so they
can send IM messages um to each after so
honestly I have NOA idea why friend is
alienating their Market base for what is
obviously a super simple application
that pings a server okay second of all
this product shouldn't exist okay we
have these thing called bluetooth
earbuds they have a microphone and then
they can they pair via Bluetooth to the
uh phone that's what the friend does the
friend is a microphone pairs via
Bluetooth to the phone Tes and
transcribes the data or whatever sends
it to the server and comes back and
pings you with the notification why is
friend not just a for $99 subscription
application for your earbuds I mean
people use earbuds all the time why
would I want to wear some random
necklace to to put around my neck um
that that will constantly pinging
wasting my battery life and isn't use
for anything
else no uh why why would anyone want
that like why that seems like a waste of
money and and
time and honestly effort when you could
just code the app and first code the app
for Android and iOS and just have it
ping either a smartwatch which would
solve the battery issue if you use
Bluetooth headphones because it might
die or headphones or Bluetooth
headphones this is a device that ply
does not need to exist because the
technology already exists okay second of
all this stuff
should why that's that's a compliment
thank you um this stuff should work
offline okay I mean it's sending
three-word text responses now granted
that is more coherent than most
teenagers would send a text response but
okay that's not the Baseline okay um
they they're sending three word text
responses based on random audio Snippets
that it
received I mean I have a AI model I was
able to use on a plane offline didn't
use the Wi-Fi because no
security I was able to use this on a
Plane 3
gigabyte jbt tax model in a did a really
really good job okay now granted this is
a flagship phone I like to see how it
perform and say a mid-range phone but I
mean it only this thing only works on
iPhones right now so U maybe they could
only have the application work on Pro
iPhones because they don't make have
enough R for the AI language model okay
but phones already have the capability
to transcribe audio to process the audio
and they're saying the three-w text
response absolutely I have no idea why
they're pinking a Ser but first of all
that's a security and privacy nightmare
okay um and second of all
it it it also cost them money to keep
keep the servers online okay so honestly
this idea could be copied by some smart
developer out there who uh could figure
out to get the microphones to always
work always on microphones on either
headphones or Bluetooth and send them
via Bluetooth to a phone and have a
process on device I mean that is not
that
hard I have no idea why the what up and
only $99 okay what if this thing dies
then then your best friend dies like I I
I don't trust this company is actually
going to get off the ground and it's G
to get laughed at rightfully show but I
I would like to test it out I'd like to
see how it's beneficial but I believe it
would probably get laughed at like the
rabbit r one and like the Humane AI pin
which I I do think um friend for not
costing so much money uh no no here the
product page and here's the application
all right so so you can talk to to it
and actually actually this this would be
nice if it could do more as on its own
because
actually
um I I think that's kind of neat in in
my opinion right I I could be like
walking around talking my own thoughts
like I talk to myself all the time I
always have like internal monologues
right I always have these as I said
quote I have press conferences in my
head
right
um I think it would be nice to be able
to have someone to go oneon-one with me
right but I don't really think that an
application that pings you with
notification sends them to the cloud is
really going to be that useful also
you're gonna have to charge it but
actually I I would give this product a
chance if I you know had an iPhone
um because I think this is useful okay I
think it would understand or it should
be able to understand because I mean
think about the SOS are infinitely
smarter than say like aage human smarter
I guess um should be able to understand
like knowledge of you know simple High
School geopolitics that I like to talk
about or you know like Samsung just like
it would be like a best friend that's
molded in frames for me and though I
have tried other artificial intelligence
applications as friends like uh like the
regular ones and the ones that are
designed to be friends they're about
iffy but this one is designated to be
your friend so I like to see how the
coding work behind that and you know if
if I committed sin well okay
um and it can check your phone see what
it says I wish maybe had a voice and
pauses and comes up with something good
to say you can see it cost $99 has no
subscription which I do like always
listening means it's connected to
Bluetooth forming the internal
thoughts I don't know how they're going
to make money because the subers have
got to take lots of money um the that is
encrypted and all men can be deleted in
one click it depends on what the servers
are and unfortunately you do need iPhone
to work right but let me tell you what
our strategy here is at the techboy
media right because as as you guys know
all these Christian companies people are
did and or will going to be um or will
be attacking this friend on the basis of
Chris Mory and artificial intelligence
blah blah blah and we we've already
debunked on how that's it's not a sin
it's not a big deal and we have bigger
things frankly to talk about okay like
it it's more important to evangelize to
the man down the street than it is to
criticize some random necklace that no
one's bought yet and no one will buy and
I guarantee not guarantee but I predict
that this company is gonna be broke by
20128 they're not going to exist anymore
okay so I'm not gonna buy
one
but the the more important things we
have to do but I mean the thing is here
we and I was trying to say this last
episode but I mut of we Thrive off of
controversy that's our business model
okay all right let let me let's teach
you a lesson here okay in in 2023
December Christmas there's this calendar
it came out with people
and it there was this huge controversy
huge okay andac you can go look it up
online on on Wikipedia type in calendar
gate and uh there's a Wikipedia article
about this about a calendar that
literally no one bought okay
um it and guess what did I really care
about that issue no not one bit like I
look like I cared no it had zero
nothing but guess what it also has C
Samsung phones and guess what I wrote an
article about Samsung phones using a
calendar and guess what I used the octop
that was trending with it people click
on it and boom we got 400 clicks on that
article according to blog spot stats
inflated but we still that article was
very famous okay and it's also Evergreen
because for some reason this got brought
up back in April for some reason all
right um then there's this thing where
people were putting laser eyes on their
photos did I care about that yeah a
little bit but it didn't really have
anything about
attack but I had to teach some people
how to put laser eyes on photos you use
the
put it in you you make your nice little
tutorial boom you got your clicks guess
what guys here's the strategy
controversy drives clicks so if I'm
going to create some huge controversy in
in in the Christian Tech Community uh
congratulations hope you clicked on the
video okay and also um Can Can we um
redo C of the gate just make it AA gate
it would it would bring me No Greater
Joy No Greater Joy then for Matt walls
or Bible B podcast cancel me because
there was this one podcast that was not
canceled but talked about on his show
had 20 subscribers now it has 500 so you
know let's do this come on guys I am
begging you literally begging you to
cancel me okay um anyway here's the
artificial intelligence friend that's
what we're going to talk about but now
we got to talk about the children's
online privacy protection building as
you guys know I'm not that big a fan of
Copa it's annoying we tried to get into
like the Ed Tech it's
so complicated you have to do all these
things you can't have comments unless
you po you can't have comments unless
it's like restricted or moderated with
like certain buttons and stuff it is way
too much work just to have have like 12y
olds access to websites I was like no
whatever this is a 13 and up website
whatever that's why we can have comments
on the YouTube videos now and you like
do do live streams and you know it's
it's more engaging kids want to watch
just don't tell me your age all right
well this's this Children online thing
that is going to
cause uh social media applications in in
effect to have mandatory provincial
controls installed on they have time
limits on them and stuff like that okay
you can guys go into this but let me
tell you it is an awful awful decision
and whatever if the president signs it
in or if he vetos it doesn't matter
because it's a veto proof majority so
whatever um it is got to be the dumbest
thing I have ever seen in my life
well one of the dumbest things I've seen
lots of dumb things all right this this
act if if it goes into effect it we're
going to effect six months from now
would cause pral controls be embedded in
every social media application probably
that closest within you know lots of
money in United States which brings
people to effect like please define
social media I come on please okay
second of all it also adds access
provincial controls on the server like
you guys don't get how bad this is like
if you have princial controls on the
phone you can circumvent that or
whatever princial controls on the server
means that literally every say Instagram
Direct message or SnapChat direct
message that you send will get pinged
and then like closed or blind closed
copy depending to to whatever account
that you have set up on there and it
will be the owners of course will be on
the social media companies to determine
if people are 18 so they have to have
face scanning or something like that
which normally people are against but I
guess now because you it's G to get kids
off their terrible phones um people
afford it which I have to say to that
that is a terrible decision let's get
into why this is bad decision hopefully
I don't have to explain this too long
okay first of
all um companies are smart and they
don't want to lose their revenue because
that's their job it's their job to make
money okay chat applications are not
social media and if they become social
media that's even worse because that
would include everything from VI to SMS
Etc okay so that would include email at
social media which would then basically
mean provincial controls on literally
anything that's from the
197s and up okay anything yeah I mean
honestly if they expanded it to chat
applications they could probably expand
it to
walkie-talkies okay they could expand it
to like anything that communicates with
anything else okay so that's that it's a
terrible idea so let's just say chat
application aren't included in it right
but only because Instagram Direct
messages are bundled with Instagram
mobile application the pral control laws
would going to affect but if Instagram
just had a mum of intelligence all they'
have to do is spin out the DM DM
functions into its own separate
application boom it's its own app it's
its own service it's like WhatsApp
whatsapp's not social media okay it's
like telegram okay well I mean the law
doesn't apply to that so everything
works fine and people are okay it's
Snapchat I
mean is that social
media not really it's just like a
chatting application so honestly what
you're going to see here is Smart
Companies are just going to split off
functions of the applications and make
them into different applications which
then teens are going to be happy because
are going to be okay with because you
know the Spy laws wouldn't apply to that
right um and then you're also going to
see the definition of these these
companies changing from social companies
to everything else companies right right
obviously isn't social media so maybe
you'll see pivoting to more of an email
based thing or X pivoting to more an
email based thing or something like that
right these companies AR G to Market
themselves as social media because this
this is a privacy nightmare okay
like you might be saying well in the 70s
kids didn't have this yeah but they had
some shielding or something like they
could be their own person if everything
on the phone from the server so there's
no circumvention of it pings itself to
another person you're going to be
obviously different right you're going
you're going to act different and how
are a kid supposed to like learn and and
and explore right it's not my fault that
kids mostly are stupid and are going to
do stupid things on the internet right
so here's what we should do instead of
legislating companies to basically add
myw into their products are more likely
spin off into different um departments
because no company wants to lose the ad
Revenue like that right and some of the
parts that to build look good
but but we're only talking about the bad
parts right
now instead of you having spin off into
different mobile applications or
websites because if the if the
legislation isn't careful it might say
apps and well it's a website whatever
um
then what they're going to have to do
is figure out
circumventions of this but the thing is
it's not my fault that kids are stupid
it's not their fault that kids are
stupid here's what they're gonna have to
do just just just I don't know teach
them better internet safety and um
security right I mean a bill that could
fund that to have like a specific
curriculum put into schools about
internet Safety and Security right uh
maybe not from National level maybe like
state level so each St state gets to
pick it right and and they they learn
something and they take tests and maybe
they
can they have to submit that to create
an account or something which it would
be easy C do it but I mean it would be
better than just directly adding those
controls into the applications and
directly causing stress for the
application it's just really bad and let
me tell you like we said in um in in in
April right April right and like
literally an hour after I got like you
know booted
um guess what I said kids like readed
they're resilient you like really you
try to ban Montana tried to ban Tik Tok
in 2044 right but the of course the
crime would be that if Tik Tok is able
to get into Montana it's a $10,000 fine
on B dance right not F on the kids
obviously kids are resilient they're
going to use VPN okay they're going to
use age changing they're going to change
their faces and stuff right they very
bizerk and second of all I mean heck
they might make their own site oh wow
it's so irrational oh wait we did that
yeah they they'll just build their own
site they build their own they might
build their own you know um communities
and also but you're taking money literal
money out of some people's
um bank accounts like this so that's
let's not try to like legislate
everything please okay I mean that that
that would be that'd be nice okay um I
mean I mean next thing you know there's
going to be mandatory controls and
phones and computers and unlike uh
Microsoft recallers people freaked out
about they're gonna be super excited
about that now which um of course is
double double standard so hopefully this
doesn't happen I call it the bill
abysmal of course you know can't vote so
you know can't really do anything except
for the two people while watching this
episode which probably also can't vote
but um
yeah and there's actually a video about
this we might react to this next
[Music]
um next
uh next thing next next episode right
but now now now let's get into some some
videos some tech commentary right which
is my job and I will do it okay like if
if I took a step back from every that
older people knew more to me but some of
the older people were calling on bril
calling to bully people so uh you know
maybe I'm bit smarter than I L on if
maybe who knows um but let's get into
some videos here all right oneui 6.1.1
is coming out to the Samsung Galaxy S
and I hope
it honestly my battery life is 12 hours
which is okay but not that good I mean
12 hours I want the phone last at least
18 24 hours you know six six hours sot
each day that would be nice you know not
not not 12 hours so 12 hours o of
existing so if I sit that pH phone down
it might last 24 hours but if I set that
phone down and set the phone down and
use it you know it's gonna die at 534 or
six hours um depending very exciting
Samsung video for you guys today we're
gonna be talking about oneui
6.1.1 for the Galaxy S it's so nice
being able to have a flagship device now
because well I had a flagship like brand
new flagship device like in in the year
that it got released for more than just
s
November um it's nice having that
because that means all the updates are
going to come you know soon and
now we're Ultra in the Galaxy s24 series
of course that's already on the zold 6
which I have right here and the Z flip 6
but a lot of people have been asking
when are we going to see oneui 6.1.1
application selction we have here we got
um the phone app Gmail of course slack
and Chrome and beo on on the bottom
which beo beo was a great it it was a
great two days the greatest two days
ever and then we got um it was like you
know what's it called swiping on the
kids and typing and you know it's like
wow guys it looks like got an iPhone and
then it died so sad and then on the
other phone we got a phone Gmail X chome
and then beo it's interesting that X in
the middle of the screen here on my s24
my s23 my s22 kind of complicated today
I'm going to explain what's going on
with that before we get started I do
want to thank my fouron Jonathan we've
got the lobster hanging out back here
always gives us some toys dinosaurs to
hang out we appreciate him also if you
guys haven't yet make sure you check out
my friends and partners over at
mintmobile Mt mobile has premium
Wireless starting Ates 15 okay so let's
just get through the introduction here
you go what's new in onei 6.1.1 why
would you want it well first of all
there's some new Galaxy I features which
oh yeah this this is interesting and for
some reason I'm still on Samsung
internet um even though Edge is a lot
more fluid it's a lot more fluent
um it it actually does a lot more Wonder
like the the tabing system it can hold
more tabs the Incognito is a lot better
it Samsung internet needs to get a
little bit better A lot of people are
waiting for partic right so yeah I'm
really excited for this photo ambient
wallpaper has already been feature and I
really don't like how Samsung's
basically like they're being used to the
Forefront which is good but it's not
really a new feature right I talked
about that like months ago on detch all
right and then Health assist
um I think that already existed a
drawing assist I'm really really excited
about that of course they do have some
censorship enabled on it right you know
there is some uncensored artificial
intelligence but it's not really on
device even my offline um AI is still a
bit censored um and then of course we
got um photo assist um which does
transform portraits into different
styles you saw that with the Sydney
Sweeney swy whatever um who name is and
people are like sharing um clips of of
who like wow she's so
excited she's so excited that um Samsung
made it into a nice oil painting AI
cartoon thing wow she look really happy
um for those of you who don't know he
only Sydney Sweeney is an actress okay
she's getting paid by
Samsung n i I can't believe that she's
able to fake for the cameras it's not
like it's literally her job okay it is
quite literally her job to fake for
cameras I would hope that she can fake
for Samsung too now I don't know if
she's genuinely impressed but I mean
that's not really news okay that's the
kind of thing that deserves to be on the
front page of Microsoft Edge which is
filled with a bunch of ads and idiots
all right then we got browsing assist
just normal stuff but photo assist
drawing assist I'm really excited for um
drawing assist because I mean that is
high level technology right there
particularly the drawing and of course I
do wish offline maybe in four years this
will work assist function and photo
assist which lets you get these
stylistic representations for portrait
portrait studio right there and of
course drawing assist which I was photos
just could get a little bit better like
you can move and resize and that's nice
but I mean I like to oh and also add
some things in but when you add things
in it just looks like you just copied
and pasted to in it doesn't give like
Photoshop quality effect it it needs to
get a lot better um I like to have a
true mobile photoshop on I mean do I
have photo leap not photo leap pix kit
or something like that it's nice
but the it you still need some more
advanced features on the device a huge
deal because the galaxy s24 has a
built-in s pin which the fold 6 doesn't
even have itself it allows you to sketch
an image
inside a photo or the gallery or notes
and it generates a lifelike picture
using AI so these are two features we're
waiting on there's also some other smart
reply stuff that will be coming I like
this test to see smart replies versus um
you know just like the regular replies
and messages and stuff and speaking of
messages Google messages is a mess it is
an absolute mess and I hate that Samsung
is basically being forced to push that
absolute piece of junk on millions of
Sams device Samsung messages is arguably
better than Google messages Okay Google
messages right let's go into Samsung
messages here okay I'm just G to open up
uh a message
um here we
go here here's a message from flip which
was the application that sent me a lot
of stuff and I did some work for them
right so there's a message from SL hi
the tech boy someone sent me something
there we
go you hold that down down and you can
copy or select the text if you click
copy you can copy to the clipboard and
if you click select you can it opens it
up in a tab there and it allows you to
pick how much text you want to select
you want to do that in Google
messages good luck okay you open Google
messages you have to set as the default
SMS of course and I I'm set it I set it
as a default SMS so now I'm going to
search for
flip okay
so here's a flip message I go into here
guess what I don't see any selecting for
some reason there's create which I can
now create a photo Emoji that's that's
fine I guess and I can send reactions
which is fine wait oh there's copy is
this
select but yeah but there's no select
there is view details though um the copy
is is at the top though which is
unfortunate so
it's still lacking features um that
Samsung messages has also there there's
no grouping at the top it's just like a
it's like a um it's at the it's it's
just very Bland they have a Gemini in
here that doesn't really do anything
other than regular Gemini um there
there's a search like even iMessage has
you know some groups at the top
but I mean you can pin you you can pin
PE one person or one message um but it
it's very boring messaging application
and in my opinion Samsung messages is a
lot better and it's sad that competition
is going away because now we're going to
be forced to use you know RCS which is
of course more secure and hopefully that
doesn't classify as social media so then
you know people have to literally
install back doors in there to
um to comply the X right um which we we
we went over already right
um then so let's get back to one6 that's
just one one thing I I really don't like
Google messages you know being Force
some devices oneui 6.1.1 and we're
hoping for camera improvements in oneui
6.1.1 as well yeah that would be nice um
I did notice you know cam look decent on
here but I did notice that um in in
certain photos um like when you zoom in
or something it is set to two megapixels
or something like that and the shter
speed still could be a little bit better
oh for the Galaxy s24 series of course
you may know because I've talked about
this before the Galaxy s24 Ultra will
not get oneui 6.1.1 as a build number
because usually the extra 0.1 is
reserved for the
foldables oh okay so it's on test servos
now and the tablet so this will be a
oneui 6.1 build that will arrive to the
s24 Ultra with the code basee of the 1i
6.1.1 code that is on the zold 6 and I
just checked for updates right now it is
August 3rd at filming time and there's
no update oh hello Thor Pearson um I did
just check there's no Android August
update yet now oh uh let's let's get a
let's get another person's opinion on
this so Thor you might have heard about
the um
the the the children's on uh online
privacy protection act that is going to
basically install back do into every
under 18 account in six months um to
allow PE parents to access the contents
and messages of everything as well as
add on the accounts as well as limiting
the time that people can spend on there
and blocking some things on the accounts
what do you think about it I was against
it for many reasons due to like you know
the the the broad definition of social
media the Privacy implications that it
has intact and how we can just teach
kids to be smarter instead of you know
having to legislate that and also how
companies are easily going to find ways
to get around it such as know um
changing out messaging features into
into its own separate application so
then it's technically not a social app
anymore what do you think and as he's
responding here let's get back video
this is the latest we have right now
from tun Vats over on Twitter the Galaxy
s23 31i 6.1 build has been spotted on
the test server uh ending in CX G it
looks like Samsung is making really good
progress with these oneui 6.1 builds
yeah exactly I mean how are kids
supposed to grow and learn if literally
every message they send or comment or
whatever is getting pinged off to
someone else right like they just become
essentially carbon clones and
copies that are based on the
6.1.1 code base we've also seen very
similar builds uh making progress for
the Galaxy s24 Series so one could guess
that we will see this update roll out
sometime in August probably it's coming
to August so I I I think it might come
with the um oneui 6.1 security update
for August because it's August 3D and it
hasn't come out yet so maybe they're
waiting um they usually like to do on
the first day of every month Samsung Ed
likes Google likes to do r on the first
Monday of every month so maybe just
going to wait until um Monday which is
in two days the
5th probably mid August sometime we know
that oneui 7.0 beta was also delayed
until the third week of August so that
Samsung could complete I hope that my
Beta can come out to like I never have
gotten a beta yet I've only seen betas
for a onei for Samsung watches in my
account but no Samsung phones
development of these oneui 6.1 updates
dates based on the 6.1.1 codebase from
the foldables so the 17.0 beta is in the
third week of August now according to
multiple sources if you want to check
check to see if you have a beta you have
to go
on well I mean it does get deactivated
from um the the servers I guess when you
turn
18 and I I guess it's an interesting
point there
though I I that that really wasn't a
major concern of mine with this um
program but it also does raise some
hacking concerns like for instance the
Gap phone um back on October 7th 2023 we
talked about the like these provinal
control applications and phones and how
I was against them and called them
basically out and did I get yell that
online for that yes of course um
but if you think about the Gap phone
right I've been reading about it like it
has no internet and then they tell me
and it also has 4G uh GPS track and
everybody I was like okay well this
thing obviously has an internet
connection it's just is blocked by the
user by gab right which gab sends text
messages
[Music]
and uh GPS data back to the to their
servers and back to a parental account
and this pral account controls what
application you can access which is then
only also control app right but but
everything that's on that Gap phone is
basically except for files are sent to
the gab servers and then to
theal account the people set it up
right well I mean that is a major major
hacking concern right there because your
phone is actually more insecure than it
would be normally right if you have an
Android phone you have text messages
using un accessible over the web unless
you're using Google messages and
directly sync it up with that for your
Google messages account right but
everything that you sent on the is
synced up and I think photos maybe GPS
data whatever is synced up there to
people who of course you don't know the
T it is and I really doubt that people
take gab security seriously so anyone
who can figure out your parents names
which easy if you you know go to school
with them and figure out the emails
which
again easy okay um could could
potentially figure out how to literally
hack into your phone without touching it
right the these these controlled phones
are actually less inse more insecure
than say a normal phone would be right
and actually that's what this things are
going to do right I mean what what
offense uh I mean how many parents but
would you be forced to or allowed to add
onto a social app right I mean like you
just basically created a backd draw into
every social application on every produ
um product right also for people who
aren't kids right so 18 and above right
if let's say Instagram says hey you look
17 so we're going to put this block on
your account unless you can prove you're
18 or older send in your ID right now
I'm fine with ID Services going to um
people for like a legal inappropriate
content or like alcohol and drugs or
whatever that's fine right but for
social media accessing websites I'm not
really a fan of that especially since
these companies like if they ask for
your IDs they have to keep them on file
because you know then someone else can't
use it the security of that might not be
as good right and having an account
directly tied to your
identity and it getting breached
wouldn't be as good like if someone's
Instagram got breeds now it's bad but
like if it's TI to their ID you can get
their state their license their their
car and everything like that honestly
this is this this is a nightmare it's
not good and this is why we it's Sly
slope that's why we should be just
legislating um stuff now do I believe
the intentions of the the bill writers
were good yes but
again this is why I have to must
commentate on technological events I
mean I I I know about these things right
just because I'm a kid actually because
I'm a kid probably closer to reality and
knowing what's going on than someone who
doesn't know
what's going on right
so because I'm like closer to the ground
like have more boots on the ground I
think I'm more of an expert on this and
some people would give me credit
for and a reason then that oneui 6.1.1
which will be this update again it's
going to arrive on the s23 and s24
sometime in mid to late August now which
features will the different models get
that we don't know exactly and Samsung
hasn't said but I think it's a pretty
safe bet that both the portrait studio
as well as the drawing assistant which
again I had to reset my fold because it
was having some notification issues oh
no that's not good um though of course
he probably doesn't have like lots of
thata on there because he has lots of
phones so he probably has put post stuff
too also got have transferred over from
oneui 6 switch which I've been told that
I need to like completely reset my phone
and back it up to something else and
didn't go in because Smart Switch might
have transferred the bad battery life of
my s22 plus over to the s24 ultra I
don't know I don't really have a way I
can do that and of course I don't want
all my stuff in the cloud because if
that were to get
hacked it
it's no I'm not against the cloud I
just like
it's also like lots of gigabytes like
hundreds and hundreds of gigabytes uh I
had to turn these back on but I think
both of these will arrive to the s23
ultra and the s24 ultra s22 Ultra I
don't know yet because of the processor
it could be a proc I'm not sure how the
processor would I mean obviously you
need to have a processor but not really
sure how drawing Assist work without a
processor with with like a strong
processor it has it's on device and
thank you Samsung thank you a lot
processor issue there now we know we're
getting huge camera improvements on the
s24 Ultra Series I would imagine we'll
also see some of those rolling out to
the s23 ultra after that we don't really
know when the update will be coming the
foldables from the previous year Z flip
5 and zold five should also get drawing
assist I would imagine as well as the
photo assist feature as well now the
transcription feature on the fold six
which allows you to see kind of in real
time a conversation going back and forth
that may stay exclusive to the foldables
because it works really nicely with the
main screen you can have one
conversation on each side of the fold
well we already have the translation on
our devices already that may only come
to the zold 5 and perhaps the tab S9
Ultra but it likely will not make its
way to the Galaxy S Series if you're a
little confused about why everyone's
talking about oneui 7.0 as well as 1ui
6.1.1 and 7.0 icon just don't let that
good though I did hear that they getting
tweaked so I mean you know there's still
some hope for the
future it's because one you I 7.0 will
be in beta testing later this month that
will not arrive in stable until October
or November could be relatively late
this year because Google has pushed back
the launch of Android 15 so right now
this oneui 6.1 build that is based on
the 6.11 code base really the C gate 2.0
is back people
Isabelle we had delca just uh started
cooking a cake
again and
H we're back
people we're
back please please let's make aat thing
please
oh my gosh she's back that you're
waiting for on the s24 series the s23
series because it is what will be coming
down the pipeline more immediately the
other updates will not be arriving as
immediately so we will need to have some
time to wait before those become
available in any event hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did like
comment subscribe hit the notification
icon all right so that's let's go guys
take date all right
um now we have some headlines to get to
on the tech
boy.org let's make this the number one
site on the
internet after the B sorry which also we
got to talk about the B we having some
problems uh
oh whatever yeah it's having some
problems okay um so actually I didn't
think this article would do this well
but it is so thank you um the penis
should be Mighty with finger actually
unseated uh the M8 versus M7 article can
you believe that and then we talked
about web apps we talked about was that
this week the internet
alternative no okay that was last week
right so web applications I said that
they're annoying and here's let's go
so let's get into character right you
know all the stuff that I base stuff off
of is that vention Odyssey which um we
can go on a tangent about them soon but
here we go this web B trend is annoying
so let's say you have a decent computer
in the 90s right so you got Windows 95
on it so let's say it's 1997 okay you
got Windows 95 a gigabyte of ram so it's
pretty good A Pentium process it'll take
gigabyte hard drive all you use of
everything land games word processing
databases research and all of it's
entirely offline right and how do I know
this well a internet speed are bad you
might not even had a connection yet and
also land games don't require internet
like doesn't mean to just link up the
computers over
ethernet word processing obviously
databases researched entirely on offline
right I did my research people did that
so that's good now imagine it's 2024 you
have a decent laptop right so let's say
you got Windows 10 right so it's not the
best you got Windows 10 um 8 gigabytes
of RAM a 5 and 256 gabes of storage
right okay so this laptop might cost
like three four maybe $500 now okay and
guess what guess what the review
magazines are going to tell tell you
they're going to tell you eight use it
for Netflix YouTube Google Docs in
graphic design in Chrome
in canva okay why why is this okay by
the specifications Windows 10 we can't
really compare Windows 10 to 95 is
processing but Windows 10 supports more
RAM than 95 8 gigaby has eight times
more gigabytes of RAM than this computer
a core
i5
um I can't really compare the processors
like off the top of my head 56 versus 10
okay it is basically 20 20 20 25 times
yeah about 25 times more storage all
right and you're telling me that the top
apps like we use is Netflix YouTube
online wood processing and canva right
in fact these computers are considered
borderline useless without a Wi-Fi
connection right you go say what on
airplane mode and they say hey guys you
can download movies and um check your
offline emails congratulations and you
know why this TR is because in 1995 or
1997 right web apps I guess they kind of
existed but the connection speech
weren't as good so people made stuff for
the computer to work offline okay's
let's go into some more examples here
incard encyclopedia discontinued in 2009
only to be replaced by SC Wikipedia
downloads from kiwix which isn't as
beautiful as incarta looks i' never had
it right and you can't even find incarta
image I mean you can if you use archive
I don't I don't have it's legal and it
doesn't even work on mobile devices why
is this like why is it that hard to make
one encyclopedia with maybe some games
and some videos and not just like boring
Wikipedia well not boring but
comparatively boring online like this
incarta looked fun and people actually
use it for research um in in their
schools why what what why don't we have
offline encyclopedias like are we
expecting the internet to be gone
247 uh no okay computers are not
swimming boxes okay I'm not complaining
about Apple TV only working online
that's fine okay and these aren't just
gay wasted internet they tried that 97
98 they didn't really that didn't really
work we got full Desktop Windows on here
why why aren't we doing anything okay
you got the cap desktop Computing
doesn't mean wow you have the capability
to split screen and windows now you can
scroll Reddit and movies at the same
time but you want to do that get a
flagship phone you can split screen all
you want okay I like web applications as
an option right they're good for lock
down phones or computers the Gap phone
okay like if you can find a way to
access the internet then it's nice that
you can you know see other applications
maybe like canva or Instagram or
whatever using the browser of your Gap
because obviously it's based on Android
that has access to Internet right so if
you find export there
then then good then then you can access
stuff right but let's say you have an
actual computer or phone let's use the
power of that actual computer or or
phone right if you have a slow computer
like so computer and yeah web apps are
good as long as a good connection or
secondary option you let's go to the
most tech sites you search the best
graphic design software you see Cana
Adobe Express Adobe Express is great but
doesn't have that many images inside it
what what happened to clip clip art okay
you're telling me that the free
resources of canva are over 10 gigabytes
we accept three gigabytes of game
downloads for say maybe asphalt line or
that that
weird uh Disney racing game that I
wanted to test what was this really
boring whatever three gigabyt of
downloads it's telling me that we can't
have three gigabytes of downloads
allinone for an all-in-one graphic
design application let we do I do have
like
photopia not photopia um let me see what
my photo editing application is called I
used it a lot yesterday um actually had
some fun um pix kit I mean the graphics
they're okay but it's not like the
stockum just that canva you know has
inside there for free all a computer of
260 R of storage of course to be able to
handle that phone 512 obviously should
be able to handle this the the asset
canva uses and image manipulation is not
that hard okay graphic design is not
that hard that you need to have because
like what I'm describing here is what
your Chromebook the difference between
the Chromebook and this is just it feels
nicer like the screen is brighter bigger
screen better keyboard that's nice but I
mean and I guess the pro processor to
run like some tabs but of course Chrome
is optimize for you know Chromebooks but
your computer that you pay pay for like
why would you even need storage if
you're just going to download a browser
and use everything offline I online
sorry and technically Google Suite Works
offline like Google Docs and drive and
stuff but it's very limited okay voice
typing stock images handwriting I think
I'm not sure it doesn't work offline
second of all because it's not a desktop
application you can't even unlock it so
if I want secure documents but want also
want offline access I can't have either
of if I want your documents that means I
have to have it online all the time
because it forced me to be signed in on
my computer um to access the documents
right so if I wanted to it always just
sign out but if I want to offline access
and I type in right and maybe I'm not
signed in well then it won't give me
access but if I just go down here turn
off Wi-Fi then the documents are loaded
in cash why would it do that at least on
Microsoft Word you can save your
documents and Google Docs Google Docs
doesn't even let you like lock specific
folders or anything like it's it's very
like okay uh so so document security is
non-existent on here so everything's
like for the web and everything's also
for one user and why can't Google at
offline clip water or file locking or
anything like this okay I mean I had
that on Word 2007 which I use on a
desktop computer which is slowed in my
phone all right then smartphones are
worse okay an episode of the computer
Chronicles which you talked about um for
lots of time on some time ago on the
podcast me a few weeks um they showed a
databased application on a computer with
eight megabytes of ram
megabites and they're trying to Market
them to people to like save recipes and
stuff like that where's that where
where's that like you see computer ad
now okay you you'll see a co-pilot
button and maybe someone sending some
emails that's what you're going to see
you see an Apple MacBook ad you're going
to
see uh some person typing in Long
battery life that's it you right let's
let's watch let's see the M4 one of the
most powerful chips um M4 Mac B one of
the most powerful chips ever and this is
what they're gonna have people doing for
it here's here's the
M4 Mac no they don't have the M4 Mac
okay I don't know if the Mac here's the
new Mac cck Pro from Apple 20203 okay
this is just direct from Apple from the
Apple YouTube channel let's go
wow col which I was so annoyed at
Samsung when they talk about the Deep
blacks of
um of the S21 Ultra let me make sure the
sound is playing on here because I got a
notification let's
check okay it looks like s let's go
supercharged by the M3 family of chips
the most advanced we've created for a
laptop what is it it has a Next
Generation GPU oh okay so they got yeah
have some exual Computing stuff on here
thank you Apple
finally to blow through super intense
workflow I can't even see what he's
doing though I don't know if that's in
the browser of is that photoshop
[Music]
and up to 128 gab of unified memory wait
a second this is the MacBook Pro so that
that's
neat but um but even the A's should
should be getting in on this action and
they don't really do that and on Windows
it's even worse okay so I guess thanks
to Apple for actually doing something
like
that but here's a ad for Samsung laptop
I guess it' be in the book a category oh
no this the galaxy

5050 here for online it's and it's also
very Niche very limited and let's go
into
the categories let's pick uh no let's
not
going let's go to the 4u
section and here are the top spons
applications that are suggested for me
they're very bad applications
but they paid Google money and Google
took the money and they said they W talk
online there we go all right Tik Tok
obviously online bingo LIVE online some
game that when you run around and shoot

on here is games that's sad really
really sad okay and then shopping
entertainment skip the sponsored
messaging food and drink restaurants
delivery tools and utilities most of
these are online and that like we have
all this processing power why aren't we
doing anything with it all right now
let's go back to the
article um the top games like I said the
top games look like they're designed in
Microsoft Paint you want me to refute
that claim prove that claim let's go
into it all right let's go um I'm going
to go to the game section of the of uh
the Google Play store
okay top jge the top three games um
speak writing extreme 3D does this look
like this is the top free game in the
Google Play Store right now let me make
this big so you can
see that is the top free game literally
looks like some kid drew that in
Microsoft ping okay then we got Roblox
completely online and it is a game where
the graphics are intentionally in
marketed from 2006 which is smart by
Roblox but I'm just going to leave that
there sword of con
Valera is literally a game from 19 19 87
adventures and odyssey gra level
Graphics right there people offline
games which are very bad games
including some random card game the dot
game that you get on the kids menu at uh
cracker barill a snake game uh some
other card games wle and
hangman congratulations people all right
and then the next one is Block Puzzle
constellation which is sideways Tetris
block Bast which is sideways tet which
is Tetris offline offline which nice
okay Monopoly go which is online and
completely overrated snake Clash which
is another iteration of the snake game
uh Arena breakout I don't know if that
is inv v m May honk which is a mayong
solitude it's some classic so the top
games here the graphics are bad they are
based off of card games and the ones
that are good probably
require internet connection go to any
smartphone rev you and you'll find out
that the most tested and unfortunately
most used applications are clients to
access websites clients that's what the
Instagram application is it is a client
to access a web to to access the
Instagram website and Tik Tok it's a
client to access the Tik Tok servers
right people went hold database on 8
megabytes of RAM and people go to phone
reviews for the best applications for
you want proof let's go to PC mag and
type in A35 which is infinitely more
powerful um than the computer that we
mentioned at the top all right here's
the G to a835 review hope you see it on
the
screen and here's what they're going to
test the test it with okay not counting
the benchmarking applications which
obviously don't count because people
want to go play with Benchmark
applications on the
phone here you
go so they they they test out the
display nice big bright display great
then go test the performance here are
the tasks that people use on their phone
let's go Amazon Reddit Gmail Google
Calendar three out of four three out of
four online only okay um switching
between the three out of four online
only applications didn't pose any
issues and then he has some been marks
which we're not really caring about this
phone right what are you going to do
with this computing power if you're only
using any called the most basic task
regular tasks Amazon Reddit Gmail
calendar let me repeat that for you
Amazon Reddit Gmail
calendar and then he ran ginin impact
which that's what the people lean back
on to I guess stress test the phones oh
guys look look you can do Amazon Reddit
and Google but you know gch and impact
that's what we really need thousand
phones for like okay gench and impact is
just like a
simulator thing and alto's odyssey what
what the heck is alto's
Odyssey
vide it it's it it's it's honestly
embarrassing that we have all this
processing power and that we've been
reduced to
use web
applications for them it I I can't stand
it I can't stand the way that these
reviews uh um work right we should be
judging devices by what they can do on
an airplane I I would like applications
such the space recogn application Sports
shopping all some of it to work at least
offline at least like maybe an offline
catalog right and not just like a book
offline encyclopedia that you don't have
to actually go actively go out and
download from some random projects on
the internet which and here's a s
tangent here those false projects looked
look so bad and they make things so hard
on themselves because they treat Foss
like it's a religion
okay I I was looking at this website I
was trying to find some software
directories
um software that iies and here here's
the free software directory um hopefully
you can see this on the
screen here you go
right of course they have to I have seen
this stupid text thousands of times
probably when I'm looking at software
they're like free soft is a matter of
Liberty not price think free is in free
speech and not is in free
build um okay it's fre the r copy
distribut going to the whole spill about
corporate software's B blah blah blah
it's all lock down whatever but they
make things look so hard on themselves
and design matters of course like this
this does not look appealing okay to
people and second of all instead of
chatting normally over Discord slack
email text Instagram no they have an IC
meeting fine but this looks really bad
all who the heck is who of octodor sff
libra. check that sounds sketchy and
then they want you to check the date and
time for the meeting and instead of
linking you to a nice helpful website
they give you code to run in a literal
terminal to find the time um to find the
time to to to run which I mean most
people here are probably going to be
accessing
from um
from from from from Windows okay I like
as much as they might like to Kit
themselves they like to use um Linux
genu Linux uh they problem most using
Windows but but that's just that's just
a digression I want to see if this code
even works okay so I pulled up my Cary
WSL drro oh it actually works Friday
August 9th at 11: a central time okay
great that's that's nice I guess but you
know website links still work but they
just make things so hard on themselves
anyway let's let's get to this Mr Who's
The Boss
video and he did make a new video and I
um I have to go talk about his wedding
speech one time um it's
very sad honestly all right let's go to
um I guess we can talk about this after
the um which she was the
boss Z flip 6 versus Z six oh not voes
but and Z6 with you here we go
we have that same phone also people were
teasing him for throwing the phone I G
to throw my phone like that poor
phone oh
oh yeah that's nice but like I was
saying what do you got oh you can't even
see it let me um share the screen you
guys can't even
um just rewind here you can't even enjoy
all the processing Powers it's the top
five apps and it's really hard to find
apps the top 45 out of 50 apps are
online only on our clients to access
social sites a few weeks ago I switched
out my Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra for
Samsung's newest fold see people teasing
don't the Z fold six and the Z flip 6
and and cards on the table I got some
bones to pick so starting with the fold
on one hand this is nice yeah it does
like the I like the color it does match
the titanium of the Ultra Series so
that's good a neatened up lighter
thinner faster version of the last pH
and lightness is you know important as
you know it is a folding phone so you
might be holding like 7.6 inches of
clean buttery goodness in the palm of
your hand so you can go look at
Instagram every time I take it out my
pocket I also can't help but feel like
Samsung hasn't fixed the fundamental
issues here and I'm not sure Samsung is
even it's always funny when people are
like trying to show that they're using a
phone to like swipe down the
notification shade you know wow guys
like it's so smooth like look look I
think that's X I'm not trying to fix the
fundamental issues so if you're coming
from a non-folding phone the first thing
that you're going to instantly notice is
the crease and it's getting that's true
I've seen not this phone but other
folding phones from Samsung in the store
and you do notice them I like to know
how like how someone dayto day 100 users
would 100 days would if they really
notice it if they just like like I mean
I don't really notice my bezels on the
screen well I guess I kind of do because
te look but most people probably don't
notice the bezels on the screen like a
few days in it's the point where now I
am perplexed I am perplexed how even six
Generations in Samsung still hasn't
managed to just fix this line going down
the middle of their screen that
companies like OnePlus have already
proved can be done better with with
their gen one folding phones
exactly they just need to improve the
hinge it's the way this phone is
pinching on the screen every time you
close it and it's I'm not sure if that
really would bother me or if it's really
in effect so just might be Aesthetics
get more noticeable the more use it the
main rear cameras are good is what I
would say if this was an $800 F yeah
that's annoying I don't understand why
this isn't the ultra Ultra phone um from
Samsung Samsung when you start
innovating like this is just an apple
Type move that they would
that they would do like apple releas
like some random folding phone even a
Google type move with some random
folding phone and that put the best
cameras on it I makes one of the stuff
for the ultra but I mean please put a
zoom camera on at least 10 they have a
zoom but at least a five or 10 coming
from the s24 ultra you really can feel
the compromise whether that's the more
limited Zoom range the slightly less
reliable focusing system thanks to the
lack of laser autofocus which is
ridiculous I mean laser autofocus can't
cost them CU it was on LG phones back in
2014 just the extra bit of graininess
that creeps into dark photos and videos
because of the smaller sensor here now
most people who go out and buy and use
this phone probably won't know what
they're missing out on but that's my job
having used both of these phones to tell
you that what you're getting here stings
a little bit especially considering that
you can now get a brand new Galaxy s24
Ultra for like $1,000 while the zold 6
will run you 1,900 it's too, 1900 all
1900 so the price hike price hike for
literal nothing times the price and it
couldn't be see it made complete sense
to me that the first Galaxy fold was
significantly more expensive than a
normal pH I mean a lot of R&D would have
been required to build all the new parts
and Concepts from scratch for something
that and even that phone had 5
connectivity when none the other phones
incept for the S10 plus 5G like spefic
5G model um did did at least I believe
it did have 5G let me check I might be
wrong on that let's see
zold 5G
let's
check
zold
specs so here we are in GSM Arena back
in
2019 um
yeah they had a 5G version of this phone
um in September so yeah I mean even this
had some of the latest and greatest
Technologies at the
time what what were they doing come on
Samsung Samsung didn't expect to sell
many units of so they had to recoup the
cost somehow but that's not the case
anymore in the current market Market
this hinge and this folding screen these
are standard Parts this exactly and
Samsung you know help standardize that
you know with the two and the three
which were great upgrades like from the
from from the from the one which which
is this phone here right and you might
not be able to see it as well but the
cameras are smaller I mean if you see
this phone here and line it up with the
A90 it looks exactly the same it's very
small very round um the bezels are
basically the size of the screen the
screen is actually smaller the screen's
6.
7.6 now um and the
battery is also smaller um from from
here to the zolt 2 which is a big
upgrade and then the three brought even
bigger upgrades with you know under
display selfie camera you got a oh you
can't even see the what is it doing but
see like the bezels here and the bezels
here and the this would look like an A90
um or a880 something like that um if you
let later in the screen size actually
smaller and the batter is smaller um the
problem is Samsung kind of stopped
inating I'd say at the four because the
five is iteration over
the than this but it's like $8 to $900
more expensive to you for no other
reason then that's become the default
expectation yeah it would be nice if
Samsung reses maybe 1,400 1,500 right
that keep them in the top chge like Z of
course is still the best V what you can
get in the United States of America in
my opinion maybe over maybe the one plus
open might be better um that's that's a
good question good debate but
um personally I'd rather to see fold but
compared to International competition is
still not that good and even compared to
Samsung's
own candy bar phones it's not that for
fs and they know they can get away with
it paying $1,900 for a phone you would
expect this to be the place where
Samsung frows every single thing they
got I mean but I I'd expect this thing
to have 6G the first 6G phone honestly
the wall but instead you get basically
the same camera setup as not even the
s24 ultra but the tiny base Galaxy s24
and your selfie cameras are even worse
the that's not that bad because you know
you got the fun one's not too bad it
takes 10 megapixel shots that make you
look nice it's standard Samsung Fair the
inside 4 megapixel camera makes you look
sick and I I don't mean that as a
compliment I mean that literally
shooting photos on this reminds me of
shooting photos on the PlayStation
Portable camera like 15 years ago and I
have heard a few people saying well this
camera is designed for video calling
which is low quality anyway so you're
not going to notice the resolution but
disagree the resolution is so low that
you can't record 4K video with it which
I have found myself wanting to do a
pretty decent amount the camera seems to
have a persistent faintness to it
presumably because of the extra layer of
pixels on top of it but also since the
whole appeal of a phone is to use it
while it's open and use flex mode to
prop the thing up to record videos I
don't think you can argue that this
camera is only for video I mean I think
you could because who's taking videos
with that when you have the nice back
cameras so I think the I would like them
to get better but I wouldn't really
count this out as a problem see as you
have two other great options your calls
at least 20% of the time
this is the camera that you're going to
want to use to shoot stuff also who
shoots selfies like that I don't really
understand like who take selfies that
much that you need that if you do get a
phone with the pop so the quality really
matters and it just makes you wonder how
did this happen Samsung introduced this
4 megapixel under display camera on the
zold 3 it was terribly received then and
they've had the four the five and now
the six to fix this and so how have we
ended up in a situation where this is
the camera experience from $2,000 20 no
look yes that criticism is it's good
right Samsung better but I don't really
think this is uh one of the major points
of contention one of the major points of
contention is it's lacking features
micro SD card like headphone jack I
would like that back on the on Ultra and
of course to hold features it cost
$2,000 it's sad that an A1 has more
features than say the Z4 second of all
no Spen slot 24 Flagship grade
Enthusiast smartphone anyways the front
screen is wider than it was before which
is a nice Improvement it looks neater
they've got rid of all of the weird
Corner screen bezels but it does still
feel just a little bit like like no
man's land it's very close to feeling
like you're using a normal phone and
that's impressive it kind of reminds me
of the Experia considering what this is
but it's still just a little worse in
every way a little bit too tall a little
bit too narrow and yeah same as
keyboard's been very very glitchy not
glitchy but kind of like the haptic
respon and the
the the typing has been very inaccurate
thank goodness for Samsung AIS which for
some reason is the the moderation needs
to get better but I can only imagine how
bad I must be typing on a skinny phone
like this or does he flip a decent
amount chunkier than a bar phone and
this whole structure creates a bit of a
thermal compromise too it's not hugely
surprising I mean when unfolded you're
having to light up a larger screen area
which creates more heat and then when
folded this is a thicker slab which
makes it harder for that heat to escape
and this isn't some Niche wonder what
would happen if you just kind of like
opened it up a little bit like a vent
out perk that only affects your gaming
frame rates after prolonged periods of
play so many times when I have this
phone open and it's like slightly warm
outside I'm noticing I can barely see my
screen because it's dimming itself to
try and prevent overheating and two
times it's very sad because I would
think the cooling would be in be
actually better when it's open because
has like all the space you know gone one
step further and refused to open my apps
because of temperature just a my phone's
only done that once I
think it didn't let me open any
applications it just stopped me from
split screening a YouTube picture and
picture I don't live on some sub
Tropical Paradise Island basked in Sun
all day I live in the UK look at I'm
eating baked beans in D it's there is no
reason I should be getting temperature
warnings this severe with normal usage
oh yeah also one of the things I love
about the Galaxy s24 Ultra is the
battery life that's one phone that I've
I
don't I wish never had to worry about
but this with both a smaller battery
capacity and a larger screen to power it
runs out anywhere between 15 and 25%
faster and that puts it very much in the
anxiety Zone I mean I do nowadays pretty
much always carry around a power bank so
I'm not left stranded but that's just
made me realize how much more often I
reaching for power here the flip does
kind of fix this issue but I'm getting
to that phone there was also
quite a bit of emphasis that Samsung
placed on the new AI features here of
course they do it's 2024 but uh are they
only good some of them are I'd say the
vast majority do still fall into the fun
to play with but I won't use often
category I suppose the most useful kinds
of AI features are the ones that allow
you to do things that you already do but
better or faster as opposed to the ones
that just continuously add more
different options
because I like options you know it's
nice it's make phones fun we're visible
get set to travel this summer with a
Wireless plan that'll keep you connected
on the go you know we're only human
there's only so many features that
you're going to be able to integrate
into your life but this is why I love
the idea of all of this automatic
translation stuff like being able to
have a WhatsApp chat across a usually
impenetrable language barrier but not
actually having to think about the
language barrier I think that
translation feature already existed on
the keyboard too anymore and also did
take away some stuff like Gramm and
YouTube from the keyboard so very sad
smart select tool it's exactly what I
was saying it's making the kinds of
things that you'd already be doing
anyways trying to
fiddle shut the door in Fr to around and
select stuff faster I was I do like that
also super excited about this new sketch
to image and there are moments where it
all works the way you expected where you
managed to perfectly place a
one-of-a-kind dinosaur within uh that's
not what he drew but okay the scene of
your day out and you feel like the
protagonist in a superhero movie at the
single moment where unlimited power has
just been this would been so good for
News videos when I taped school so fun
dropped in your lap but I would say
there's too many constraints right now
exactly yeah censorship's annoying it
seems like there's some sort of safety
restriction when it comes to adding
things to faces which I mean it makes
sense considering all the Havoc that's
been wrought by Deep fakes lately but
then at the same time faces are the main
useful thing that you might want to add
things to and there's also other issues
I'm bumping into like draw smaller
objects or Draw objects closer together
to generate I think Samsung's just not
ready for my big ideas and you know what
using this feature consistently reminds
me of just how silly it is that the one
phone specifically designed to look and
feel like a notepad does not come with a
built-in S Pen like the s24 ultra does
you know the smaller of the two phones
smaller is so the only real remaining
question is then do the folding features
make it all worth it I feel like I've
made it pretty clear at this point that
you're giving up a lot to get these
features you're paying twice as much
money you're having to deal with a
crease a terrible screen camera two
displays with unorthodox aspect ratios a
compromised battery and no S10 so should
you well as far as the physical act of
being able to prop your phone up on flat
surfaces it feels cool I've used it a
fair bit that's neat but there a wor n
900 to record time lapses of things
happening or watch movies on a Plane by
sitting the phone up on my trade table
but it doesn't really matter I would say
you'll actually have a distinctly better
experience just using a normal phone
with a kickstand case since you'll get a
bigger more natural full screen ratio
and also often times with these cases
magnets for better wireless charging I
mean there are things that do uniquely
utilize the display on this phone the
taskbar for starters is an amazing
addition this whole one tap to instantly
being another app is a genuinely UNG
gimicky efficiency Improvement that you
just can't have on a smaller phone but
ultimately it's not for me you might
know that I spent a few months trying to
use an iPad as my main computer oh wait
he gave up that I thought he kept and
the whole reason that failed was simply
because oh July okay because of the
mobile operating system same thing here
while it is impressive how interesting
how much this thing can do for a phone
the truth is that for most people this
phone is still a little bit too fiddly
and not quite efficient enough to be a
good main computer yeah makes hard to
justify back on the web app topic most
of the St the people doing is web apps
so all they need is a big screen and
that for this price you can actually buy
a good equivalently performing flagship
phone and still have the money left over
for a great laptop
so I fold and if you're looking at
buying this please make absolute sure
that these specific folding features are
things that you'll definitely use
because if you splurge on a f yeah and
maybe you might want to go back into the
uh to last year's model let's go to the
Z flip why he likes it which doesn't
hurt in an era where everyone a flagship
Galaxy S who flip six though is actually
very different and in my opinion a phone
that makes more sense if the fold is the
insecure teenager trying desper to be
something they're not the flip is it's
eccentric siblings who sure they're a
little bit odd but they understand who
they're trying to be through many years
of interesting analogy bulking up the
specs on these phones it say Samsung's
now got to a stage where the Galaxy
zflip 6 is basically a flagship Galaxy
s24 plus that costs yeah no you're not
going to call it a flagship s24 plus I
don't think the screen is QHD um no
telephoto on there um the screen's also
narrower
okay so com compare this this is a nice
mid-range phone if it didn't fold to
$200 more but folds in half and that
isn't pointless it's partly just a bit
of fun which doesn't hurt in an era
that's nice like I said make phones fun
but like I going to pay $200 for fun but
everyone's always saying that
smartphones have peaked I can't lie if
Samsung ever gave you the option to have
their top end Ultra phones also fold
without any compromises I take it in a
heartbeat well exactly because that's an
actually accident Advantage because it
has good cameras and you can take
interesting camera angles and videos and
stuff like that in camcorder mode this
like they're advertising the camo
features to a bunch of teenagers who a
aren't going to buy it and
B aren't compfortable to iPhone pros and
they've really dialed into that fun with
all the unique front screen customiz I
guess it's fine like why an ultra wide
for some reason that's acceptable on an
iPhone 16 that cost $7.99 I don't accept
it because Samsung's supposed to be
better and funky case options and this
new photo ambient feature which overlays
real weather effects onto photos that
you've taken existed already it's very
pointless but brings me joy pointless I
can tell you the
we oh come
on is Joy worth that much money is Joy
worth
$200 is Joy overrated it's callia Joy
overrated potential lifestyle benefit
because unlike the front of the zold 6
which is basically just a slightly less
comfortable phone the front of the flip
6 has a very clearly distinct feature
set to the main screen yeah it's
different this is much more like having
a smartphone and then a completely
separate Smartwatch as opposed to this
which is like a smartphone and then a
slightly worse smartphone and when I
switched over to the Z flip 5 last year
I did find that the physical barrier to
go from this Smartwatch stage to the
smartphone stage actually did make me
use my phone less and which I guess is
good for battery and actually it's good
like this is different than the Light
phone approach Light phone is like we're
gonna be bad and you're gonna pay a
bonus and Samsung's like we're gonna be
decent and if you want to have avoid the
internet or something whatever you have
the front screen but it's still more
functional than the whole phone of a
light phone so I accept it from Samsung
though I don't really like that kind of
marketing and then you do lose the three
times telephoto camera that the 24 plus
out so you only get a main actually the
teleph on here really good for
surveillance like some scoping and stuff
it was actually better than my like
pocket telescope because it was kind of
going in and out so that's you know I've
always been into smartphones like that
so best one for spying and ultra white
but I would actually say that it makes
up for it with
selfies yeah see unlike the fold which
can use its high-end rear cameras to
take selfies here that's actually the
default way to take selfies if you want
to take good selfies on the fold you
have to unfold open the camera flip that
camera tap the cover screen preview I
would really like to see if Samsung
fixed it or if it's not if that's even
true um because I I think you could
probably do it from the front screen I
think um and just have it candy ra mode
I'm not sure but I I I'd have to go
check Buton physically turn the phone
over being careful not to swipe anything
on screen and then take your shot before
closing it all back up again here you
why can't you do it when it's closed
just double tap the power button and
then tap the screen it's not a perfect
system because then at the same time
anytime you want to take a photo of
what's in front of you you do have to
manually flip the phone open but the
point is this phone is a un proposition
selfies that many times this phone
designed for like teenage girls makes it
distinct and useful for more than 1% of
the population now there are a few
things that I would say are compromised
like you still have to deal with the
crease but for whatever reason it is
significantly less noticeable on this
flip than it is theault maybe it's the
orientation size
the buttons are a little high up when
the phone's open and I do feel like they
could quite easily shove them down and
they'd still work fine in both unfolded
and folded States the screen is a little
bit tall not as tall as the cover screen
on the fold but still taller than I'd
like yeah it's a bit tall now I do like
the 6.7 Ines cuz 6.3 really small also
it make the
tap you know scratch and it's only got a
1080p resolution as opposed to the Quad
HD that you get on their flat Flagship
exactly but I think that's okay I keep
my phone on 1080p anyways for battery
life and temperature reasons and it's
got the same chip as paid good money the
s24 ultra same Ram same base storage
same wireless charging speeds and yet
the battery capacity is smaller too just
like the fold also has a smaller battery
than normal bar phones but unlike the
fold which is like a normal phone that
extends into a big tablet this is a
normal phone that folds into something
half a size which means you save a lot
of battery compared to a normal phone
and exactly and if you like are dying
you could just use the much end up with
something very close to that of an s24
plus so my through line for this phone
is very much that six Generations in you
still have to make compromises for a
phone that folds if all you want is the
best bang for your buck it isn't this
and to be honest it never will be this
however if you just really like the idea
of a folding phone then you're giving up
surprisingly little to get it here and
you also scoop up a couple of little
perks while you're at it too so I had a
funny situation a couple of weeks all
right
so uh let's see how much time do we have
been live for now yeah we talk Mr Boss
World viiew get some more affordable
stuff like this but for now hey you know
come at me all you want you know
controversy drives clicks and all of
that um so of course you know we're
against the friend for technical reasons
but you know um interested just you know
not reasons um second of all I detest
and denounce the uh children's online
privacy
children's online protction act and
um yeah so interesting podcast we had
here today um God bless and Tech talk to
you later</pre>
