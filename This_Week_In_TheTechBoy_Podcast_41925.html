<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 41925</h1>
<pre>Everybody, welcome to the This Week in
the Techboy podcast. We have so much to
get into today. We had three articles
from the
techboy.org. We have some article about
hidden Snapchat features in your Samsung
phone, your Samsung versus Google
contacts, and how to track and export
your GPS away and GPX viewer apps. So,
you know, I think contacts are really
important. You know, they get to a core
essential um features of the phone,
right? you know, sometimes we we've
strayed so far away from um you know,
phone aspects and you know, I've been
interested in some aspects of retro
technology as of late, which is what
we're going to be um talking about
today. But, you know, with contacts, you
know, they kind of go back to, you know,
just a truly basic phone feature, but
you know, with Android, there's so much
that you can uh do just with contacts
already. And you know, I wish there was
some type of like holographic 3D contact
uh futuristic uh style application, but
you know, getting context contacts
really uh important um to some people.
So, let's talk about some of the most
popular contact apps uh on your phone.
There'll be Samsung contact which comes
pre-loaded on your Samsung phone and
Google contacts which comes pre-loaded
on other Android phones like Motorola
and uh
uh Mo Motorola LG uh well I think LG had
their own contact before they stopped
and uh of of the Android phone brands
Asus etc. So uh without further ado and
I know how the people from that uh
podcast hate that show let's go to
Samsung versus Google contact. So,
Samsung contacts is the orange contacts
icon and Google contacts is the blue one
uh right here. Uh, as you can see, it's
the default contacts managers here. And,
um, right off the top, Samsung contacts
wins this round here. So, if you want to
contact someone quickly, um, and Samsung
contacts, all you have to do, as you can
see on the screen, is, you know, you
have your contacts here. These people
been blurred out for privacy. If you
want to swipe left, yeah, swipe left,
you can message them. It'll open up
right up to message them. Swipe right.
it will open up right up to phone call
dial uh them um just right straight open
into Samsung dial or whatever your
default dial is. Now on Google contacts
you have to touch them and then you can
click call, text, video, message or
email. Um speaking of in Google contacts
sorry Samsung contacts when you do tap
on them you are also able to if you have
a contact only saved as an email address
it will let you email the phone number
which is a thing that you can do. It's
absolutely possible to do you can do
that in the Google Messages application
as well. You just have to figure it out.
All right. And this is what the Google
contacts application looks like as well.
Right. Samsung contacts also allows you
to save um to more things. So Google
contacts allows you to save to your
Google account, your phone number, and
your Samsung account uh and your SIM
card. Oh, sorry. But not your SIM card,
right? Samsung Contact allows you to
save to that. However, Google contacts
strikes back with this connected apps
screen here and also allows you to set a
default ringtone a lot easier um than in
Samsung Context. Now, Samsung does allow
you to select the default ringtone,
though it's actually been pretty hard to
find articles on how to do that, even
though it's a pretty basic feature of
the phone. And also, you know, in Google
Meet and WhatsApp, you can have your
connected applications on here, but you
have to go to a dedicated page on your
bar and then you have to select some
type of contacts. It's it's kind of
complicated there as well. And last but
not least, Samsung contacts allows you
to um create QR codes for yourself that
people can scan to get your contact
information and QR codes for
uh everybody that you want
uh that that you want to have. So uh you
know, Samsung Context has more features.
Samsung Contact is though less intuitive
as well. So you know you know you can
have both devices if you want to. You
can have Samsung contacts on your
Samsung phone and of course if you want
Google contacts you can download that
from the Play Store as well. So you know
if you have a Samsung phone you have the
best of both worlds in terms contacts.
So um I gave Samsung Context five
points. I gave Google Context three
points but Google Context is a bit more
user accessessful. It does have some
interesting features. I'm opening up the
Google Context app on my phone.
Unfortunately you know you can't extreme
that for the very important people I
have on my contact. You know we got you
know Jeff Bezos president. We got, you
know, uh, a whole bunch of important
people on here. So, you got, you know,
you can save people's birthdays, you can
have recent contacts, you have your
favorites, and you can organize stuff on
here. So, it is pretty nice here. Also
integrates well. I didn't talk about
this because it's not I I don't have it
set, but you have a family group, you
have household contacts, uh, which is
kind of merges in or messages for your
Google Assistant devices. So, we have an
Alexa, we also have one Google
Assistant, um, but we don't really, you
know, have that ecosystem. But if you're
in the ecosystem of Google Assistant uh
devices and things of that nature, this
uh Google contacts might be for you. All
right, now let's go over into the hidden
Snapchat filters in your Samsung phone.
And this is really nice because it
reminds me of this uh uh VTEC watch,
Kitty Buzz watch, uh I had growing up,
you know, I wanted to like had a camera
on there so you could like spy on
people. So
that's that that's great.
Um, where were we? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So,
that that that's great if you guys are
interested in that that that type of
thing. But, you know, this application,
it's an AR zone application. We got to
keep people used AR zone applications
because, you know, Samsung's going to
appreciate the features. One thing I do
not like about these things is that
Samsung has had continuously had good
features um in in their devices. I
actually have a demo of this that I want
to show you guys.
uh you know they they even had used to
have camera different camera modes that
you can download from the Galaxy Store
but they took those features away
because people weren't really using them
right we do not want AR zone to get
phased out from our devices in fact we
want them to get uh improved here as
well so uh back to AR zone and back to
you know removal features what I think
is just terrible terrible Samsung move
features we have AR emoji stickers AR
emoji studio AR doodle a emoji camera
quick measure and deco and deco pick is
a completely offline if you download it
application that allows you to have
filters and frames and masks of your
devices here. So, as you can see, you
have all these filters and frames. You
also can have gifts, gifs, whatever, uh,
that you can take into images here. So,
I'm going to take a picture of the
podcast studio and it's going to have a
happy Easter. I actually going
to flip it around. There we go. It has a
happy Easter gift on here. You can move
it around the screen. You can make it
bigger if you want
to take a picture. Now, the one thing I
don't like about this is that it saves
as a GIF. I mean, I mean, it doesn't
save as a gift. It saves saves as a
still image. Hopefully, you guys can see
this on my phone screen, which is just
absolutely ludicrous. Like, why it but
you know, it's great to see I guess. Let
me
see. You when you hold down on the
button, it's like Snapchat, so you can
record a video. As you can see on the
screen, uh, this is
my laser autofocus sensor. So it's like
Snapchat where you hold down the button
it will record but unlike Snapchat it
won't save it will hold and yeah when
you do hold it you will get your gift.
So that is pretty neat but I wish it
took the pictures in GIF format though
you can convert videos to gifts in
Samsung video play. That would be an
article uh for next week. So this is a
really interesting feature. It has all
these uh filters and modes here. You
know, it's really nice to see that, you
know, you still have some of these neat
offline, you know, some somewhat, you
know, oldest features on devices that
are still coming back because we've seen
so much old technology that's pretty
useful actually get phased out of uh
that gets phased out of of devices. Uh,
one aspect of this, we're going to have
a huge segment about this. I've been
doing so much research on this topic is
dial in or dial up internet. So, dial up
internet still exists, but you know,
diving into other people's computers for
remote access is
uh is pretty much a lost art and pretty
hard at this point. And in fact, someone
offered to tell me this, but they had me
try to like uh go against my beliefs in
this cuz they thought I was a hateful
little bigot. So, they didn't give me
the information. But whatever. I have
Grocery. I have the internet. you know,
I don't need some sneaky snarky little
veter uh you know, uh help to uh do what
I want to uh do what I want to
accomplish. All right, let me pull up my
video that I want to show you guys while
we go over to last article of from the
techboy.org. And this is how to track
and export route way points on the
screen. I think this is really important
because it allows you to see what maps
uh you can basically uh save your phone
offline see what maps you want to do and
it also so shows like some of the
applications that aren't just you know
Instagram, Tik Tok, Reddit, you know
socialesque applications. These are
actually real applications that are
useful and would have been mind-blowing
15 years ago. So you have GPS way points
as you can see on the screen you have
your uh at the top it will be showing
the longitude and attitude which
obviously I can't show that because I
took the screenshot at my house and then
it shows you the time uh the exact
accurate time too because you know GPS
needs to have really accurate time uh
for for it to work. So it's really nice.
It's showing uh showing here in military
time showing the accuracy of this 13 uh
meters. It's not that accurate for a
GPS. You know usually I test devices
that go outside. This is inside but
outside it's within two meters which is
about uh six feet in freedom units. Uh
and then you track it. It will save the
default to tracking your location for
every 10 seconds which I think is pretty
good because it creates routes like
this. All right. So you can see how I
like walked straight here and every you
can see 10 seconds. You can see the
altitude here as well. So if you want if
you want to have more I guess less
polygon style routes because you can see
how this turn is kind of like like I
didn't actually turn like that. You can
see like the tone here. Uh, you know, if
you want to have more polygon, less
polygon style routes and more fluid
routes, you can set it down to one. If
you want to save data, maybe cons to
like 60 seconds. So, it it's it's up to
you. Then you import it into this
application called GPX viewer. Right?
So, GPX viewer will uh take the file
that you export here. Make sure you
click the export button as a GPX style
file. Import it. And then you can choose
the map that you want here. I chose a
satellite map from Google. And then it
overlaid this green. Sometimes it's
blue. What you have to do is tap it. Tap
some button here to make sure it doesn't
close. And then you can see a route here
that you ran here. Um, you can also, if
you have a Samsung phone, import these
routes from GPS wayoints into Samsung uh
health uh as well if you want to. That's
like a health f like a route you can
rerun if you wanted to. So that that is
interesting uh if you guys wanted to do
that. Now, back to the thing I was
saying about Samsung. Samsung Galaxy S3.
This released 2013, I believe. uh 16
gigabytes Verizon, right? And you may be
wondering, why am I talking about this
10 20 phone at this point almost uh on
on uh tech channel right now. And the
thing is I want you to see what the
website for the S3 look like and all the
advancements that they have in this
smartphone. Remember from like 2013 I
mean first of all you start off with the
weight. We start off with the key
features expandable memory HD recording
Android 4.3. So uh you even get to see
the new levels of functionality and
features they have and I think Samsung
needs to do this. Uh so Samsung has a
few problems. First of all they need to
innovate a little bit more right S24 to
S25 barely any innovation right and also
app developers need to come out and
start producing new applications that
actually require more power to produce
and we actually need new ideas because
I've been thinking of about this
multiple times. I think I'm going to
save this Reddit thread for later
because my Reddit account got banned so
I wasn't able to reply to it. These
people were talking about how, you know,
computing has all just gone to the
cloud. It's all in AI, which I like AI.
Some people don't like AI, but whatever.
It's all gone to it's gone to the cloud.
You're not really doing anything
productive or useful and it doesn't have
that cool factor, the cool functionality
features anymore. And yes, that is a
huge problem with modern computing
today. I was in a debate with someone
and I was saying like, look, computing
and development is essentially dead.
Like he was talking about how the web is
now in the future for everything because
it's just easier that way. And I was
like, why do we still have Chromebooks?
I'm trying I'm going to try to see if I
can get him on the podcast. So, after
dinner, if you're listening to this,
hopefully you can come on to the on on
the podcast. I mean, if you want to come
in right now,
uh, let me see if I can uh get him.
Let's
see. Let's see. I am
Anyway, I'm I'm bringing him on. Uh if
if he decides to come on, we can have
him. But I think I think it's a really
huge problem here. It's like there's
nothing interesting. There's nothing new
happening in computing to like, oh wow,
look, I made a website. Oh, wow. Look,
it's another AI chat. Like it's nothing
there. Especially for like people like
low IQ people. Like we got to talk about
this huge thing that's going on. uh
super super low righty people uh that
are just going to be using chat GPT or
GOK or Gemini whatever AI image
generators to just do stupid things or
uh create fake news events anything of
this nature right as you guys know I
like to I I try to defend kids as much
as possible to have them have access to
the technology but there's a stupid new
trend where kids are like running
through a
fence yes let me let me say that again
kids are running through fences for like
some type of Tik Tok trend which I mean
how am I supposed to defend you people
if you people are running to a
fence just
like like the the if all your friends
ran to a fence would you run through it
too? I I I really just can't
fathom
this I I
um Yeah. So
that's that. Yeah. Anyway, that's that's
that's a whole different topic there.
But anyway, let's let's look at the
features here. S Beam back toback. Look
guys, we got a name drop uh how name
drop enables Wiz 10 years before name
drop apps. S beam, you mean your phone
without Wi-Fi, without data, just using
NFC just like the iPhone does. And it's
so 10 years early. Like why why would
you phase that feature out?
Why? You'd be like, oh well, you know,
not many people using so it doesn't cost
you money to have this feature in your
phone. In fact, not having this feature
on your phone kind of delegitimizerizes
the need to have NFC because like NFC is
now just used for contactless payments,
which I mean a credit card is just like
super
thin. All right?
Like why why don't you have this feature
anymore? You it it cost you nothing to
have it or at least just develop up an
app where people can download it again.
It cost you nothing. The same hardware
in this phone is in my S24 Ultra right
now. But this phone can do it. My phone
can't. Why? It has the same NFC chip.
Uh, well, not the same NFC chip, but a
better NFC chip. But, you know, it has
NFC and other people's devices have NFC.
In fact, this feature would be more
useful now because more people have NFC.
Finally, Apple put it on their phones
than they do than they did back then
when they have bezels the size of like
Panama. And then you have Sherig here.
Look here. You know, this is still a
feature in Samsung devices. And look,
look at the bezel on that TV too.
Chunker. But like you see Samsung
advertising this. No, they they still
sort of advertise this. Lots of people
don't know how to beam their phone
devices to the TV. Now it's a lovehate
relationship because like this stuff
like this keeps me in business cuz lots
of people will be able to use like
scratch to 10% of what their devices can
do. But I mean also it's not good for
Samsung. Then you have the share photos
instantly feature. Didn't even know this
existed. I've played around with the S4.
Okay. I've played around with this
TouchWiz skin before.
It just why? Also, again, look at this
design. It reminds me of a real camera.
The the green focus button. The gesture
smarter. How did we miss out on some
sort of these features? And the S4 also
has kind of like hand wave control.
Pixel 6, I believe, also had that as
well. Uh, no, not six. Pixel 4 also had
that as well. Why do we take these
features away? Why? Look, we have the
same sensors in here as we do on Samsung
phones, right? We have the in uh the
speaker phone that's in in my phone
there. We got our camera that's in my
phone there. And of course, we got our
notification LED that's not in phones
anymore. We got edge lighting. And of
course, SOS got uh moved to Bixby, which
I heard some news from Sammy Gurus that
Samsung is mulling replacing Gemini,
which uh 2.5 is decent. Gemini, I just
replaced it with perplexity. Samsung's
thinking about doing that on all the
devices, which I think perplexity is
really, really good, actually.
And then Samsung textiles. Why did they
stop selling these? Why NFC tags that
can launch stuff uh on Facebook or
Twitter and connect to any contact to
NFC enabled phone? Think about this. You
could do so much more with things like
this nature. I'm pretty sure you spend
five minutes thinking about what you can
do with this kind of technology. Someone
could figure out something
useful. Uh someone could figure out
something useful. Like why is this
uh what how is this
hard? All right. It's
just Why? Why Sam?
Why? Ah yes. All right. We got to talk
about Insta Insta talks, but we're going
to talk about that a little bit later.
We're going to talk about that a little
bit later. All right. Uh here's the
Samsung Galaxy
S3
again. Picture and picture in
everything. Powerful hardware and
software, HD recording, expandable
memory. You can see all the specs here.
Now, one thing that they did miss is uh
wow 4.8 in 4.7 ounces. Interesting. One
thing that they did miss was the call
quantity which was is still important
but would have been extremely important
uh back then as well. So you know but
still when we go into the play store and
I've done this multiple times you guys
know what to do. You pull up the
applications the top two out of four of
the top applications are Tik Tok and Tik
Tok light. Somehow Tik Tok light has.3
more stars than regular Tik Tok. All
right. Five to six are Instagram and
threads and number seven it's easy home
home screen. In fact, of the top 10
applications, and um for this, we're
going to consider Snapchat a social
media application. Uh even though it's
not because that's what it's considered
to be. The top 10 applications that are
not social media applications. Try GBT,
Watch app, Easy Home Screen, DHK, Cash
App. The rest are social media. Number
11, brings in Facebook. So, it's just
like how do we have these devices that
are so powerful, that are so useful, and
all that we use them for is social
media. All that we all that these
devices these precious precious powerful
devices is just used for social media.
Now social media is kind of interesting
guys. I have to tell you about this uh
this YouTube Instagram page thingy
called Insta Talks and Instat Talks 123,
which is a ripoff ripoff of the original
Insta Talks, which let me pull up
Instagram
here, which is a uh YouTube channel or
Instagram. Look, I It's a thing that
allows you to see videos. Let me see if
I can follow them. So, Insta Talks 123
and Insta Talks_123. Let's go to Insta
Talks one, two, three, cuz they only
have 225 followers and they pull off the
same content that Insta talks regular
pulls off. So, we're going to get into
this, but here's a picture of Insta
Talks or the type of content that is
prominent on Insta Talks. And apparently
the people that follow me love this kind
of stuff here. So,
um
I I I don't know what this is. According
to Maria from Ssaltw, she says it's
something. Let me go check. Let me see
what the sources close to the target
have
said. All right, we're scanning
through Drew
Starky and uh Rafe Cameron. So, uh
that's that's uh that that's person
who's apparently popular for something
or other. And I like just this this
page. Oh, you can't see this page does
not make any
sense. Like just it's
just Okay, so first of
all, how did she know that? Just like
what is this? Okay, so we we don't know
what this is. Maybe it's a one-off.
Nope. This is this is literally what
Insta talks is, which is just
like I honestly I didn't know there were
this many white people in America, okay?
Like like I I have never seen any of
this play out in real life. I have never
seen and yes, this is in someone's
house, but like I I've never seen one of
these flags ever. And I've seen lots of
flags, okay? Even the flag is like
triangular. I I I've never seen anyone
and maybe like once maybe once like get
up and actually do uh Yes, this is muted
because I don't want to get copyright
struck. I've never seen anyone actually
get up and do a Tik Tok dance wearing
leggings and
that what is that? Like I' i've never
seen this. And also like it's the these
people have huge amounts of follow
accounts over on Tik Tok because this
person just apparently rips off random
Tik Tok people. Uh, as you can see on
the screen and Secret 22774 has like 30k
followers according to I I checked it's
public data. Here is some more people
dancing. Preppy Sigma 2. Okay. Where do
you people find this stuff? And it's
some Tate McGra. Never heard of her or
him. It's just like is this an actual
thing that people actually do? I I' I've
never seen
this. And
again, who has time to watch this? Yeah.
Okay. Go, guys. Look, where do you find
these people? Like, just just look. All
right, I'm going to put out a message to
the fans and and to the followers. Do
you guys normally
like see this or is this just like is
this just like a a thing that happens in
the realm of Tik
Tok? And um Insta Talk 123 is a lot more
popular. Let me see if I can pull them
up. Insta talks 123 has
375,000 followers. 306 people following
them. 782 posts. 782 is not a lot of
host, you know, in in the grand scheme
of things. But like the United States is
a large
country and I've been I've actually been
to Ohio. Like that's the state I've been
to the most. All right, we're still
muted. 2,000 people like this and we're
going to see this this great content.
Just just imagine this
music. I I like but
just it okay look I'm not criticizing
them like if these people look I'm all
for capitalism and making money and and
and and in in the American way as you
can see on my head but
like but but
like how did you get 2,000 likes?
Uh, how many comments is this? Let's
check this out. How did you get 2,000
likes? 26 comments. Uh, I don't know how
to check the
views. And that's like the most. That's
not even like high. Like the next one
has 900 something likes, which is
low. That's I'm actually going to show
this on the screen. Let's go. Let's go
to these again. And like the banding is
it's it's
it's that I've never seen any of this
like play out in real life. Okay, these
people in the house, so maybe they live
next door. All right, let's check. These
people are
like I don't know where they
are. Okay, look. Look, they're in public
here. They're in public. See people back
there behind
them. Uh is that Russian? Okay. So, I
didn't know they had Tik Tok in Russia,
but okay. Here's another public place
like like this is the thing. They're the
teens of America just get up and like go
to places wear the exact same outfit. We
got leggings and that I I I I don't know
what that is. Is that a shirt? Is that a
sweater? Is that a a crop top?
And then they just stand there in the
middle of the
street and
like how how is this a
[Music]
thing?
How and they have flags like this? It's
like this this is going to go down and
you know I wish in Carta still existed.
You know I wish in Carta you know still
existed. They're going to talk about the
great 2020s and I'm like what is this?
So I I I I send out a signal to all my
fans, to the eight people who are
listening to this, which is actually a
lot of people. Go forth and bring me
answers as to where like where these
people are because apparently America is
60% white. I didn't know that until
recently. That's look it up. So I mean
the they're obviously somewhere and this
is obviously a huge trend. That's I mean
it's better than running to a fence. I
mean this this could be a good
investigation. This could this could be
I mean I mean this this could be like a
good documentary or expose. I don't know
what we exposed them for. It doesn't
look like they're doing anything
illegal, but you know, maybe this is
just a scop. This is they're just hiding
something. That's a gigantic cover up.
You know, this is this is all a plot by
Lululemon to get people to buy their
leggings. and I, as an investigative
reporter, have to go undercover and
investigate this phenomenon. So, get
cracking, eight fans, and uh get to
work. All right. Now, speaking of
something that's a lot more interesting,
everyone knows what Showdan is, which is
the search engine for the internet,
which allows you to see things that are
connected to the internet. Not websites,
but like computers. Sometimes you find
websites. I found like some TNET servers
from Lakewood and some Comcast and some
routers. and you can kind of like tell
that into them if you have a proper
permission or access uh or if you if
this was open and this isn't legal
advice so don't site me if you guys get
sued but if it was open or whatever
sometimes you can connect via VNC and
you know one thing about this there's
this application called Pentest GPT
which is an application that's supposed
to allow you to like uh hack uh things
it is Gro 3 is better at Pentest and
Pentest GPT like I as Pinterest GP PD
like how to hack a website or how to
track a phone or whatever things it
should be able to do, right? Even though
Glock is wrong on how to track a phone
because it didn't it didn't
work. It just
like Pent GPT is literally a search
engine for hacking using a GPT. It
should be telling me this kind of
stuff. Grock, you know, Grock is easy
easily manipulated, right? Gro. Grock,
you can manipulate Grock easily. All
right. I actually like that. It's good.
You know, free speech, democracy, yada
yada yada. You can use it create hacking
tools. Grock is easy to manipulate. It's
it's it it's smart. And it was able to
give me some Showdown queries and also
some 10i queries, which is like the
Chinese rip off of Showdan but cheaper.
So, yeah. But, you know, I'm going to
save up when we get my $49 because
Showdown has this really, really neat
feature where you can zoom in on any
building. It has a map and you can see
all the internet connected devices,
which is just like game over. It's game
over for any company because you can
just type in their address and see what
kind of computers they have connected to
their network which is really
interesting. But in the we old days of
the internet in the olden days back when
you had to ride a horse and carriage to
get to the computer store so you can
dial up into your little game
server. We had dial up internet and dial
up access and this entire phenomenon
called war dialing which allowed you to
connect your phone to a modem and then
uh no sorry connect your computer to a
modem and then to a phone you could dial
some computer's number and then you
could access that computer and somehow
knowledge of this great act has been uh
wiped from the internet and is
apparently impossible to attain. So, uh,
here we have Advention Odyssey 1999,
which is why I'm so so so interested in
this, right? Advention Odyssey sparked
my interest in technology, right? You
know, the Blackout Chronicles, you had
no com. You got all these people spying
on each other. So, forgive me if I'm not
going to be all against the CIA and NSA.
It's like, uh, blame the evangelicals.
So, here we go. Here's a clip from the
battle. Applesauce. This is what got me
interested in motives. I've been on a
search. You know, if this was a
pre-recorded episode, you hear the in
the wild sound effects. Uh, right now,
I've been on a search to find out how
this was done, and I found a book and I
opened up in Microsoft Edge, you have
the cuckoo's edge. Uh, the cuckoo's egg,
sorry, which is how this guy tracks down
a hacker. I haven't he detailed it much
of anything interesting yet. Then
there's
uh, let me see. Here's my other PDF. So,
I'm going to give out some examples
here. Uh, hacking exposed. You can find
a PDF of that. It tells me what Wers to
use, but it doesn't really tell me how
to connect it to a computer because
there are no modems in computers
anymore. Once again, another feature
that is gone. And I do have a modem
here, but this modem is only for a
credit card machine because it uses this
weird port that I couldn't even find any
information on. It's like some custom
port. All right, the next book I pulled
up was uh oh, it's the phone sweep uh
manual thing here. And Grock was so so
so useful for this uh investigation,
right? I haven't found all the answers
yet, but this will be my life's work cuz
I will track down. I'm going to find out
cuz you know there's still some people
that have dialup um stuff today. And
it's just like why did we turn away from
this system, right? It worked remote
access without without the internet
people. You just plug your phone into
the wall. You plug your phone into the
modem uh your computer into the modem.
You open up your terminal emulation
software. I guess it would have been on
We are so back guys. We are so back. So
uh yeah this wouldn't be happening if uh
you know we weren't dialed up internet.
I'm sure no not dial up internet it but
a dial in connection. But anyway this is
the clip from Advention Odyssey episode
83 the battle part one of three. Uh,
two. Sorry. Come on.
Mode. Oh, I'm actually going to turn on
the audio for this. Told me that
Whitaker has a modem hooked up to his
computer. A modem? Make sure you guys
You mean one of those devices that
connects a computer to the phone. You
win the golden cigar. But that does us
no good unless we know the number.
Tada. Oh, Richard, I knew you'd come
through. How soon can we get a modem
hooked up?
Uh-oh. Come
on. Let me rewind a little bit. Of
course. How soon can we get a modem
hooked up? The question of the hour. And
for the answer, I simply open the office
door and
voila. I already hooked one up. All we
got to do is dial. Well, then by all
means, dial. Your wish is my command, oh
great one. Have a seat. Okay, now this
may take a couple of seconds. Let's see.
Good morning, John Avery Whisker. Wa! It
talks. Incredible. It must have a voice
box and artificial intelligence. Yeah, I
don't have any way of talking back to
it, though. You mean we can hear it, but
it can't hear us? Yeah, but I can type
in what we need. Let's see. Load program
menu. loading program. That's great. All
right, let's see the the train set and
Noah's Arc imagination. There it is. All
right, so that's uh that that's the clip
from Advent Odyssey. And you know, you
may be thinking like what what's really
important about this, but you notice
that he dialed into a computer. And from
the books, they also say that he was
also able to dial into the grading
system of the college uh before he got
kicked out for trying to change for the
grade changing scheme, which I had Grock
look up information about. Then he loads
a program menu. um which is also really
really important uh to this
conversation. So let me see if I can
fall figure this
out. All right. So I did multiple chats
with Garac about uh diving into systems
and things of this nature. I actually
had to go look it up and I asked it what
softwares would run on this things like
this because as you can see from the
computer in which end it was able to run
software that allowed it to access over
the motor and there is some remote
access software called PC anywhere
from in in the 90s that allowed you to
access it but you have to have the
client on your computer and they also
had to have PC anywhere running on there
as well actually it's from the 80s I
believe so you know PC anywhere worked
anywhere anytime any place but and and
then he also has you know the voice
thingy um I I guess that's feasible you
you you have all this technology that is
available I forgot thank you for that uh
like random user I forgot I had to talk
about this uh yeah so so like guys this
this is really really important really
really interesting and like we just kind
of like threw it away we we can't even
hook our computer up to anymore I can't
use my cell phone it's like a VIP war
eiler but like you have to know a lot of
stuff with that it's just
like what happened to to this technology
and why are there no guides about it on
the internet that were written post
2005. Did you people just like give up?
So I'm going to open up a PDF. It's uh
actually not going to open up here, but
it's called Hacking Exposed uh chapter
11. Hopefully I don't get sued for
reading some of this to you. So let me
open it up. I'm reading it from
Microsoft Edge, which it's actually good
for uh for stuff like this.
Uh, chapter 10, network devices. No. Oh,
no. No. Chapter nine, dial up PBX and
voicemail on VPN hacking. I'm going to
go to the war diving chapter. So, here
we are from war dividing. Wedding
essentially boils down to a choice of
tools. He gives you the tools, Jeff.
Unfortunately, these tools Oh, also I
forgot this other book, The Diary of a
Black Hat Hat Hacker. They tell her how
he hacked into some company using dial
in or dial. Anyway, so he uses these
tools tone lock scan and phone sweep.
Only one of these work today. That's
phone sweep. I think some of the other
ones you might be have a hard time
finding it. And then the choice of wood
adding hardware is no important than
software. And this book is so old. It's
talking about running it in DOSs and
over a PC com PCMIA port. So like it's
totally useless for today. Of course,
you have to have your phone and voice
line. and it goes over the legal issues
and then you
know it it gives you some of the
information and programs that you have
to run uh here today and you just type
in your phone number and then you can
dial in today. Now the uh aspect of this
would be today would be creating a
showdown query of uh all the devices in
your city or local region that are
connected to the internet and you know
maybe like via TNET or RDP or VNC would
be useful today but you know like
Microsoft had this thing called RTS
hosts I believe remote
access sorry remote access service that
worked over this in Windows XP. That's
right, guys. In Windows XP, they had
this service, remote access service that
you that you could do this uh Windows XP
Pro. So, let's let's go through my Gro
query. Uh hope you guys can see this on
the screen. Uh where' we go? Where's my
streaming software? And it's just like
we we need to return to this. And yes, I
know it's insecure, but we still should
have the technology to be able to do
this and access this easily um without,
you know, having to download randomly
risky phones. So, I asked to find some
books from this time period and hacking
in general like I I computer hack, which
a really good book is free. It's closer
to the PDF online and it does all this
thinking here. It took 45 seconds, I
believe. Well, 54 seconds, 85 sources.
And it gave me some of these books. the
cuckoo's
egg. Wait, no, this is this is the wrong
chat. This is the wrong chat. Sorry,
guys. Um because some of these go chats
really intense. They gave me really good
information, stuff I really couldn't
find easily. It has high school on
Google now. Of course, um the links are
still on Google. It's not I'm not
against Google at all. No sir. Google is
still the best search
engine on on the internet. All right.
So, we have nostalgic vibes and daily
chat.
Also, all right, so I did this nice
little chat with Grock. It's really
super duper long. So, let's go into
it. All right, here it
is. So, here's how it would happen when
you ward dog to the computer back then
if they didn't have the internet. All
you need is a a computer with the modem
connected to the phone line. You're
going to pick your phone, range of
numbers, and you're calling them dial.
So, it was really simple back then,
right? And then if you wanted to connect
to it, apparently you would need
terminal emulation software so that you
could or maybe they had the software
under already just in in the terminal.
You dial their number and you'd connect.
And you know, I downloaded a modem
emulator to see if I could get this to
work. It's called virtual virtual modem
from fabulate.com. It cost money, but I
got a free
trial. It just it it didn't work for me
for some reason. I guess I need a number
or something. And then you log the
results to see if it was a fax machine
or a PC, a server or something like
that, like a main frame. But, you know,
the one thing that all the books and all
the articles about waring overlooked is
like what kind of system you'd be ding
into. Like if if I were to hook up a
modem somehow to my phone uh to my
computer and dial into it. It's not like
Windows is just going to let me log in.
It's not like you can just type in my IP
address and log in to whatever
uh whatever device that that you're in.
That's not how this works, right? So,
you'd have to know what kind of software
uh you could use. And so, it tells you
what kind of things would run on this.
Maybe the access files are remotely run
system, but it's just like how it's not
like your file system is sitting beyond
the phone line. Right now, modems are
extinct. Phone lines aren't the same. No
one uses modems anymore. PC isn't
configured configured for it because
Windows took it away from the remote
access tool. Why? Why? Look, yes, is it
maybe a security risk? Yes. But like you
still still have that option. You
already put it in there. Like Windows 11
should have more features than Windows
XP in my opinion here. Also, you know,
it could be good for, you know, retro
computers, retro
computing. Uh anyway, as well, so I
asked how did Windows XP allow remote
access via phone lines because I wanted
to figure out how this episode worked.
And it may not have been Windows, but
you like uh you know, Evans is a little
bit time advanced as well. Also, you
know, in the grade changing scheme, like
with were the grade files just like
sitting there on the server somewhere
and people could access it. No, that
makes sense today. But like you can't
just, oh wow, guys, it connected off to
the system. Uh, that's not how it works.
Here it is. Remote access service was
whereas a big part of Windows XP
professional and XP home, but to a
lesser extent, which it begs the
question, why are you people adding
security risks if if you think that uh
what's it called? Remote desktop is a
security risk on Windows 10 and Pro, but
you're not adding it on the home version
of the system. What? People at home
don't want to access the computer
remotely or they pull or something. They
can't they they they can't use Windows
remote access. I mean, if you think
about it, Windows remote access would
probably be better for people who can't
afford extra computers so that they can
remote in from a cheaper phone or from a
friend's computer than having to buy a
computer and a laptop. But, you know,
Windows go
Windows. And anyway, here's how RS
worked. And look, no one actually told
me this because you have to go way back
in time. You go look it up. uh you have
to go look it up on Google, go search
wet back, but you know, it's not really
going to tell you this information
anymore if you go search it. So, you
have to go and filter down to when
Windows XP was popular. So, don't even
go farther than Windows uh than the year
2007. And if was enabled, it would ask
for a username and a password, give them
access, and you could browse shared
folders, run programs, and even control
desktop. You had other remote software
in installed. And I found this to be
really interesting. I also found out
that some person on Reddit told me that
you that they could play video games
over a remote access doll up like this,
which is
like why this could still work with you
plug in a cell phone, you get a remote
access and you would never have to be at
the behest of someone else's game server
going down again. But no, we we took
this away because reasons, I guess. Now,
of course, it wasn't enabled by default
at password protection, phone number
hurdle. I mean, you're not going to
forget the phone number. phone number 10
digits long or some websites are 10
digits long
tb that's 10 digits right
there and then XP and here are some of
the softwares that allows you to run
remote access on this and this is really
really important this is really really
key so PC anywhere uh it's been
discontinued but allowed you to dial
into other people's computers carbon
copy and VNC which is still used uh
today uh you also have bulletin board
systems which I've access today not over
dial in but overt. So that's that's
interesting
though. And then
Windows got some systems here. Building
management
servers. Let me see if I can pull up
some
more information. So on with no external
software, you couldn't run software, you
couldn't run PC anywhere, you couldn't
run remote desktop, but you could
connect it to a local office network.
any things like this limited command
line that access access storage folders
which I think this is where people have
got
the got the thing about oh well if you
hack one computer you have still have
access to hacking the internet because I
think uh just other infecting the
devices on your network because this is
what I think has happened to cyber
security that cyber security has been
written for things of this nature where
people remotely accessing over phone
lines and like I guess still in the
early days of the internet over the
internet right and the problem with that
is is that Windows is not set up so that
my computer cannot talk to my phone even
though they're on the same network. Just
it does not work like that. Like it's
just like also people always like so
scared about getting Windows and stuff
like that. Heck, and everything
everything is just connected to the
internet. Like I don't even know why
most people even have Windows computers
anymore. All they do is browse and they
maybe they'll sit around maybe edit some
little short video and maybe they'll be
like, "Hey guys, just do a little Tik
Tok dance here in front of us." Like
these pe these kids that are on the
video doing their little instant talk
dancing things like this. They probably
don't even have laptops. And if they do
have laptops, they have MacBooks. And if
they do have MacBooks, they're just
remotely accessing the same applications
that they use on their iPhones onto
their MacBooks, right? I call it is
actually happening in schools to this
day. And even before Apple released that
feature where you could mirror your
iPhone screen onto your MacBook, it's
just they're accessing websites. Like
when Sarah Grace, for crying out loud,
was playing freaking popa cart something
uh that came out in 2007. He was like,
"Wow, guys, this runs on a Chromebook.
Of course, it runs on a Chromebook. It's
a game app. It's a website from 2007. Of
course, it runs from this." And I think
that's some of these things like web
applications have taken away some of the
allure of computing. It's just like why
why did you guys do this? And then it
gets into like the stuff about security,
VNC, and then here's the timeline of how
it went away. So, it's in XP. It's in uh
Windows 7, but it was hidden in uh
Microsoft was pushing RDP and VPNs.
Windows 8 it didn't really go away but
like no one cares because no one cares
about Windows 8 8.1 and Windows 10 it
was removed
right now when you did OIS it didn't
have a GUI so it just kind of like
a I guess terminal software here and
then what you have to do is type in like
these codes and stuff like this which is
like so cool so cool especially when you
have like I don't know if you guys can
hear this but
like like just just amazing Amazing.
Just amazing. And your access to the IP
address and stuff like
that. And I tried to see if I can use it
on a cell phone. Probably won't work
with cell phone without a huge amount of
work around. We don't have a landline
connection or a
modem. So you guys don't try to dial
into my computer here.
Okay. Oh, here we go. Here's a software
that was supported that you can actually
dial into over a modem line. All right.
Now, this this is what's key. This is
what's key. This this is what's really
driving the force behind internet
hacking back then because everyone's
talking about watting wide widing
watting. In fact, some kids hacked the
NASA uh using that same tactic.
So gradebook program and finally finally
I figured out how kids could change
their school grades from home from all
those movies from all those teen movies
and teen hackers and how Nicholas Adams
was able to do it. Here's how FileMaker
Pro Claris File Maker Pro 5 and the
manual is up online on the internet
archive. You have to sign in and borrow
it for like an hour.
versions 4 through six. I looked up
versions five is supported network
access including including modem
connections. It could be hosted on the
XP PC. The PC would then share the
database over the connection. Uh as
remote user dialed in authenticated by
and use farway compose client software
they still have to have the software on
the PC at home to edit the grades or
database and essentially a teacher can
dial in from home access database and
update the student records or host PC
the computers to the school. We will be
running the network records. Then you
have M Microsoft Access which also
allowed this as well. Custom BBS
software which is could be used to
selling files, messages, data.
Essentially like the social media before
social media. So before people telling
you we didn't have social media back
then guys, ILRC was invented in 1979.
Okay. So just like I'm pretty sure y'all
were doing IRC viral challenges as well.
And also you know if it did exist back
then you probably would have been doing
those same dances as well.
All right, games. Doom, which I mean
Doom supports Doom can run on a lamp.
Okay, so because people got mad at me
for saying that, even though it's true.
Warcraft 2,
wake. And how how much longer is this
chat? Oh, that that that's the end of
that chat right there. All right. And I
think I have one more chat that I have
to
show on this. And you know I think we do
have some of this if you enable tnet on
your computer and you go around you can
find some BBS's you can find some of
this but some of the technology like
call in radio I looked it up how it
looks got a whole bunch of cloud
providers which is like calling radio
existed since the 50s obviously they
weren't using cloud providers
okay
so like I think some of the things
people just take for granted for how it
works that they don't even tell you how
it works and it's just like ridiculous.
All right, now let's go over to our teen
our teen media section, I guess. Here we
have the Odyssey Boy. Yes, the website
is still live. We're almost done with
ssjltw. Then we'll start focusing on our
other
websites. Uh, so this is the Odyssey
Boy.blogspot.com. This is a media review
website. So imagine us being plugged in,
but like not. Uh, here we go. I created
the Applesauce computer program. I'm
going to open that up in a new tab
because we have to talk about this new
application. I'm Sades affirmation app
that girls lelay review democracy dies
in dancing. So this is the show I put an
image
here. So let me let me see if I can
reload the page there. There was an
image there yesterday. Okay, I
checked it's not showing you the image.
So that's that. So, that Go Lelay is
a TV show from Netflix that only
received one season and it is better
than that stupid TV show from uh
Disney where Oh, there it is. There we
go. Yes, you can see the image. This
makes a lot more sense here.
So, this image is actually pretty
important. It's better than that TV show
from Disney where they kind of like
roller skate around for it's like make
teen sitcoms great again. Come on. Just
no. Anyway, Nickelodeon that go. So I
guess Nickelodeon better than Disney
this one time actually no Nickelodeon is
pretty good you know Zoe 101 I quali so
yeah but you know Disney has a whole
bunch of good sitcoms that we don't
watch because we Disney Plus anyway
tangent tangent here so we have Satie
here who's in the back in the blue
jacket and Lelay is this girl who comes
out of an affirmation application who is
essentially like animated chat GBT
because you talk to it talks back to you
and it talks to you like
um interesting like natural language as
well and she's like really interested in
fashion as you can see from this and
Sadi wishes that Lelay from the
application becomes a person she comes
into the school and like this entire
show kind of makes sense like other than
the whole oh she was born from an app
uh things and she has app features like
she can run really fast because be like
holding down two features in my videos
she can teleport by breathing in because
it's like sleep mode or something like
so she has these superpowers that
related to the application But apart
from that, like she's pretty normal.
Sady's normal, right? But like the show
does not make sense because they're so
scared that people going to find out
that her cover story is that she's an
exchange student from Houston,
Texas. People are scared since she's
going to find out she's from an app,
which like that jump. It's just like
who's going to jump from, wow, this kid
shouldn't be here. H I wonder what the
number one thing is. Yep, she's from an
app. She's from an app. She looks like
an app.
Are you hearing yourself talk right now?
She's from an app. That doesn't make
even make sense. And of course, they
actually didn't leak it to her brother
who uh blackmails him for a few days
until he like dies. All right. Anyway,
so she has special powers lucy tied to a
phone that features like plasma, speed
up mode, two time
spen sitcom, which I mean maybe the
camera quality has gotten so good it
doesn't really look or feel like a
sitcom, but it does have all the sitcom
flavors in it. So they have this uh
place called like Burger Barn and Burger
Shack where the teens all like locally
hang out which this isn't every teen
sitcom ever. You know in Iconic you have
like that burger place that the teens
hang out. It's I guess it's a burger
place in in there too. In Zoe 101 they
hang out at the
uh they kind of hang out at the little
hangout areas in the school in Bell and
the Bulldogs. hang out at this like
western school. There's western
restaurant place here. I'm just trying
to think of another teen sitcom that
I've seen.
Uh oh, Drake and Josh. They kind of hang
out at the theater place and uh eat
popcorn. So, they always have these like
teen hangouts, which in real life
there's not really a teen hangout in
place. Where do they hang out in
Victorious? I can't remember. But like
in real life, you don't really hang out
at Well, at least I don't. Of course,
you know, I may be completely detached
from real life because, you know, like
thousands and thousands of people are
just out there in the middle of random
public places dancing and I haven't seen
any of
it. But, you know, I I I don't think I'm
that detached from public life to think
that, you know, teens just have like in
one town and it's not like super small
town in one town where all the teens
like kind of hang out together in like
one place. So, I think that's a typical
sitcom thing. Back to the thing. It's
not as music heavy as Aaron and Aaron or
sitcom plastic as Zoe 101, but Leila is
a bold bling out musically gifted teen
former outgoing than the shy Brandy
Sadie. She uses a chat GBT like voice
tool to boost the confidence and become
more engaged. She has a quirky family
too. Her parents are an advertising
jingle duo which is I mean they are
doing well for themselves just for
writing jingles for advertising. So
maybe I should get into that business.
Uh her 10-year-old brother is like a
stock broker investor guy.
So in the first story like Mark comes up
to here. I mean sorry Lea comes up to
here push sad out of her comfort zone to
run for high school student president
when Sadi was actually running for high
school
evangelical environmental senator or
something like that which the teacher
just let people throw food at her. Like
do I agree or think that you know a high
school student council should have a
explicit government position that
teaches people to recycle? No. But do I
think they should allow people to throw
food again? Also, no. So, she's running
for even environmental rep. Sadi pushes
her to go run for president. And this is
why call it democracy dies and dancing.
So, Sadi squares off against the
longtime rival, the mean girl, Tiffany,
which I don't even know why they're
rivals. Okay, Tiffany's just like some
tick tocker who doesn't like her and
Sadie doesn't like her either. No reason
for this. And also, why is everyone
named Tiffany mean? Tiffany Rockler,
Tiffany Victor, Tiffany from Advent
Odyssey. What is wrong with people named
Tiffany? Are they all coast to be
mean? Anyway, Tiffany, Ila, and Leila
and Sadia are fierce few rivals who
sometimes kind of have to get together
to do this. Anyway, anyway, instead of
having a normal election, right? There's
like 15 kids in the school. Like this is
one thing that's wrong with this place.
Like in most sitcoms, you're going to
have like decent background people. Like
even in PCA, Pacific Coast Academy, you
had like even in the episode uh where
they almost ki out the girls from the
school and Zoe was about to sacrifice
herself for all the people. You had at
least 30 people standing out there in
this school. You only see 15 people at a
time. 15 people.
Anyway, the the debate they they have an
election day debate and instead of
debating over policy over like shouldn't
people let people throw food at other
people when they're running for
environmental rep or
something. So Tiffany goes up to her,
she says, "Vote for me." She's like
super popular influencer to like 200
people even though 15 people attend the
school apparently because those are the
only people that show up to the debate.
And like Tiffany as her loyal sidekick,
it's always this one loyal sidekick
person or two loyal side psychic, you
know, like those little secret service
agents that like girls walk around with
like who's popular or something even
though she's like really mean to
everyone. And like so Lelay debates, I
mean not Lelay, sorry. Tiffany debates
and Lelay and Satie get up there and
start doing dancing. Oh, I forgot to
mention this. Uh Satie Lelay Lelay can
also like pause so she can freeze time
for 60 seconds as well.
and Satie dances and the principal just
hand the the election. It doesn't make
sense. What happened to democracy?
Democracy just died and dancing. Like by
all logic, Tiffany should have won.
Tiffany was more qualified. Tiffany was
more outspoken. Tiffany was more
outgoing. Okay, that's what you want to
see from a student council president,
right? You don't want some student
council president who's kind of like a
wimp and incompetent. Okay.
Also, Satie drove through a wall. Okay?
Okay. So, it's not like Sady's like the
most competent person of all
time. So, like, yeah, if I was Tiffany,
I'd also be mad too if, you know, I ran
for student council president and
instead of, you know, getting asked
about, I guess, abortion policy, which
is another stupid thing, but at least
they didn't challenge me off to do a
dance off with these other people and be
like, well, you know, you lose. I mean,
if I'm going to lose, I might as well
lose going down a blaze of
glory. Now, Boombox focus this quirky
nostalgic hood. uh hub, sorry. And they
have some
rappers that come up there and do some
competitions. And apparently the
Alexander family is religious. And by
religious, I mean they attend church
once a
month. And that church episode is like
I Okay. When they count offering, they
count it in pennies, which is just like
how are you this poor? But also only
seven people show up to the church.
Lelay overheats. Remember she's like a
cell phone because he's like lying or
something. And then she just dives into
the bapt baptism pool, which is just
like right behind the pool pit for some
reason. And
uh the choir sings every word in the
show. Like they never talk. Like when
they're talking, they always singing.
And by choir, I mean three people in
choir robes. And the pastor is just
like up there yapping. like just what
jokes are they basing this off
of and uh you know it's it's pretty
pretty interesting show you know it's no
explicit content so it's good there you
know Marky's funny smart plot relevant
the dad is goofy but he's actually
useful he not really useful over in like
Lelay and Satie because it's more a show
about them he's more useful for to his
wife and to uh his other child Marky who
he has to make sure doesn't like scam
off the neighborhood
So, you know, you know, if you don't
care about democracy, but you want to
see an interesting show, that girl Lelay
is interesting. You know, it's not as
fun as so many other shows because, you
know, the entire plot kind of gets old.
You know, with these teen sitcoms,
having a good school cast is really key.
It's really important, but
like there's only like 15 people at the
school and one person that we talk to a
lot other than uh Satie and Ila, and
that would be Tiffany. So, it's just
like twoonone. Oh, I hate you. Oh, wow.
I hate you more. So yeah, you know,
democracy has died in dancing. All
right, s
ltw.blogspot.com. We are almost almost
done with this series here as well. So
I'm going to start sharing it around a
lot more. So here's my message to these
people here as we about to proceed to
embark on Crush War
3. If you do not like any of the content
in the series and if you think something
illegal was happening here or that I
mischaracterized you as a character in
SSA declassified anything that you don't
like in this uh series is fictional and
didn't happen. So um I am not legally
culpable for anything that happened
there. So this is SA declassified here.
So we have to get to the setup. So after
the summit which is when Ethan Shay and
Denver and all these people go up to
Babbling Brook Mall and you know we did
a Denver we accomplished our goal. So
now it's kind of like winding down. Real
friends build stock market too. And like
I've been saying for the past six
months, right? There's been this huge
situation that's about to boil over. And
you know for the plot obviously there
wasn't a stock market in the real
school. Almost happened. Almost
happened. All right. Proposed the idea.
You know I did the slack stock market
technology that I was building in here
is real. It's a real
uh it's it's a real technology. It
actually exists. I can actually sell
them here but I didn't actually sell
them. I just gave him up here anyway. So
that's the back story here because you
know the stock market thing is going to
lead to like some type of investigation
because you know what happens in crush
doesn't really make sense for like ninth
grade to try to like uh you know destroy
the most powerful agency in the school
like no it's not a good idea. Uh anyway
here we go. Real friends build stock
market. So we set the president we need
we need to write moral outings are
legal. And so the thing is the premise
of this uh article is students make sure
you're building a stock market tracker
tracking the stock market over the
month. So you pick a stock, you track it
every day. And I was like, "No, I'm not
going to do that." So I make sure that
you can uh you can do this. So I create
a software program, which I mean this
this entire thing is about software
programs. You know, sometimes you make a
good software program, sometimes you
make a software program that sparks
World War II. This one's a good one.
Anyway, I I create a software program
with these people and allows you to
track the stock market uh automatically,
right? And of course, we have this joke
about Hawk News trying to like spy on
us, which which is the real thing. I was
like, "Hey guys, what if there was a new
news service at the uh school that tried
to undermine SSA and G Cam and GNN?"
Well, of course there was. Of course, in
the book there's the thing called Hawk
News. So, it's kind of like an internal
reference there as well. So, anyway,
uh again, we referenced last episode
where I talked about the pictures where
we talked about this is again true. Like
most of the stuff in this is true. If
you don't like it, it's not true. up.
There we go. Uh where we did a whole
news article segment about how some kid
got a new iPhone 14. So you
know yeah we it was slow news thing
anyway and then I talk about kids again
a real thing I want to tell you see if I
can find that clip I talk about kids
with this booming economy it's youth
government you know the whole scandals
you guys know what kids is and I wanted
to feel to feel the school is kind of
feeling secure you know SA GM relations
are kind of like uh but like you know
SA's apparent also you know more
powerful uh agency in the school so
here's where we kind of delve up from
relevancy. Denver does create these
things that allow you to uh sell uh
cardboard necklaces and the entire
premise of this is that I create a stock
market on Google Sheets or something.
And then Gavannimo who as you guys know
was a known like felon in the uh in the
series and in the life unless of course
you want to dispute that change then of
course you know he's a known felon as in
uh fictional known felon. Of course the
name's changed. So if you think that
you're a felon and you come to me and
say, "Hey, I'm not a felon." Then you
kind of out at yourself here because I
didn't call any people felons. Anyway,
uh then we start selling these things
and I put them on the stock market. They
look little cardboard necklaces and then
starts buying some stock in the company
as well. And meanwhile, SSA is trying to
investigate and spy on G Cam. Once
again, I uh see quote meanwhile SA
launch investigation. They sold the
shares to invest into company and uh you
know the Bplot is I track down some of
his AirPods and he can't find them so I
have to go track them
down and Maria breaks the communication
deal again um wanting to be a solid NTB
replacement for the greater good. Oops.
I'm going to have to change that to CSM
because NTB doesn't exist in this
universe. So anyway, while the stock
market is going, SSI starts
investigating Maria and Gcam as a whole
under investigation due to breach of
communications protocol. This is
suspected loyalty labs as well. And then
we have the loyalty evidence assisted in
Hazel 2.0's phone in number
investigation in which we indicted for
that as well. But then of course she did
leak some evidence and operation last
chance. So she backed out of the secret
student government program. She changed
communication still and unilate limited
SSA questions here as well. So, I had
this whole plan to generate a fake fate
secret to see if it needs here as well.
Obviously, this is AI because it would
never call something operation prank
zilla, right? So, here's what
happens. Um, back to the Aplot SSA then,
you know, in on this investigation
uncovers more information about SSA Gam
and then we create this software called
Operation Metrolaf, which is supposed to
help us become better friends to other
people. Then it cuts off here as well.
So essentially the plot of the thing is
this. SSA is running a stock market.
Joan Mo has most investment inside of
that stock market and is helping uh
Denver's economy boom. Meanwhile, SSA
takes it shares out of the stock market
so that we can go and reinvest inside of
Denver's company. We invest inside
Denver's company and we go back and
investigate Gcam for a suspected loyalty
lap just here as well. So that's the
setup and once we do that, we create a
software that helps us make friends
back. And now, and this is true, you can
go go set set up Reddit crush war drake.
And it's probably the synopsis is this.
So, Denver, who has who all all this
money is now inside of this stock
market, is being pressured by Gonimo to
leak the software that I created,
operation retrolleaf, um to Maria. Uh uh
I wanted to keep it a secret.
Unfortunately, he tells others spreads
around the school. But unfortunately, I
want to keep it a secret so that you
know we can use her software in a
vacuum. Like everyone knows it's
supposed to do science experiments
without
uh with your control. So if Maria knows
and she's going to change her actions to
perceive based change the data based off
of the software as well. Software is
still up and running. So you know
anything here. Unfortunately Jaman Mo
talks to Denver again. Denver presses
Maria to show the report. I mean leads
show Maria to report. I relent thinking
it might do some good. unfortunately
freak out like none of it in shoes and
then essentially we go into G camp
versus uh ninth grade versus SSA war now
um all this happened in real life except
except for the stock market here as well
which I had to write the stock market
thing in because if I don't write the
stock market thing in it just sounds
really really bad as to why people would
leak this kind of data and also it
doesn't make their plot as well. So, uh,
plot spoiler here, okay, but apparent
essentially ninth
grade is trying to invade G cam so that
uh he he can date one of the members in
G cam or whatever. And of course, all
the other people in ninth grade are
like, "Yeah, let's do this. Let's go
just invade G Cam." Unfortunately, they
know that SSA is the most powerful
military like force alliance on Earth or
in in the school, sorry. And they know
that uh that's not going to happen. Gam
is not going to get invaded because it's
like an ally. So it' be like if someone
tried to invade Canada. Well, you know,
United States is going to it's you're
not Yeah. No, it's not you're not going
to get away with that.
Uh so they have to take out SSA in Crush
War 3. So uh ninth grade can go in fate
G cam. So what happens here is the stock
market starts to crash here because uh
Denver is pressured into uh doing this
because if not then John was going to
take all his money and he's going to be
in debt. So Denver asked me to shut down
the stock market. Everyone gets their
profit from the company here as well.
And of course, defense team goes in to
start neutralizing the rumors. Denver
and Maverick start pushing fake news uh
in the GNN studio, which is kind of
ironic. So, of course, I got back, get
out ahead of the uh
of get out ahead of the uh fake news
pushers and go on and start pushing uh
uh Jesus is the center of my life
catchphrase,
which yeah, that was in a YouTube stream
last time, last last year. Uh very
funny. Anyway, we go through all of
this. I do this like speech thing here.
I like to reiterate that Jesus is no one
else is this inside outside the sin of
the school sin of my rights blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah and then essentially we go to war
with ninth grade and then we nuke them
into oblivion because you know we win we
do a sting operation where we get all
these kids like stuck under a bridge and
then they all get they all get stung and
then let's say marginizes creates a
Snapchat account create a Clash of Clans
account which just got deleted because
that got boring as part of operation N O
R M a L which is posted to our high
school which got really boring. So, and
then um later in the series when we do
our series wrap-up, you're going to
seeing how we investigated the loose
ends and found out that this entire case
was orchestrated by ninth grade to
destroy us to say um and to invade GMO.
Unfortunately, it failed for them. Well,
not unfortunat not unfortunately.
Fortunately, it failed for them and they
lost. So, you know, whoopde-doo.
All right, let's see what the next thing
on the docket is to talk about. Well,
we've been streaming for an hour. I
think that's uh enough. Um, you know, if
you guys have any questions, email them
to contact the techware.org. Godness.</pre>
