<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 22424</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech booy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
this weekend The Tech booy podcast we
have had plenty to talk about this week
we launched our new search engine and
it's an actual search engine so it's not
like one of the
any this any that search Eng is just a
dedicated search engine for hacking we
utilize Google
csse um for
it uh so if you want to add your site to
it be sure to send me a message via
email all right and now it's time to
start the social share so that everybody
can see the uh stream is live so let me
just see I am live and then I have to
put in the
link and then we
have yeah so we are going to be oh we
have a person here hello Kate so let me
just take a screenshot here
um so we're going to have open questions
if anyone has anything and we'll go
through
our
um hello Thor it's like the Ali be stcky
chat um we'll have our um YouTube
reactions nothing much happened in Tech
news we did talk about the
s20 uh nting phone and I guess we can
talk about Gemini the
uh image generation problem that it was
having slight you know slight problem
um yeah so but first after I show this
we will start talking about
the um our Tech headlines we didn't have
that many Tech stories I posted last
week's article onto the blog and then I
launched the search engine in an
official blog post hopefully some more
Tech news stories coming out one of the
big stories coming out this week is that
the Samsung Galaxy s23 series will be
getting the AI features from the s20 for
Series so I mean hey maybe I'll get s23
Ultra I mean it do have better better
Zoom uh optically at least so that's
good I am live
so yeah I mean and it's only $600
opposed to say
$1,200 like it it's basically s24 Ultra
half off no it's not made out of
titanium maybe it won't have as good
battery life but I mean
still that is pretty good price for an
s23 ultra and it will be getting
basically the same features as the s44
ultra via a software update all right so
of course our top headlines for the week
were our normal headlines of course
because you guys know
that and then we got I made my hacking
search engine and I'll just weend the
tech boy podcast and then tell that and
as you guys can see here here Great
American family I made this into a news
article from that Ali stcky
stream spend over $200
phone how mean makes sense but I like
flagships but you can get them cheaper
on eBay so maybe an S21 which is still a
flagship a few years ago you can
probably get that for like 250 on eBay
you just have to wait a few years and
you'll get a good phone for say $200
$250 okay
and the s23 ultra will'll be getting the
S2
for um features and that's good oh also
open AI launched s and it's causing
people to stop um wanting to make a
movie studio because s is like good like
it's too good like it might put people
out of jobs or whatever but I mean they
can find other things to do it is a
dedicated job to become an AI prompt
generator like you're still going to
need to create your own plot movie so
they'll probably just become AI prompt
generators let me see AI a13
was AI promp generators and stuff like
that sought after profession so um jobs
in the movie industry may be going away
um because of AI but I'm pretty sure it
will open up new jobs in the movie
industry but everyone's scared they
scared of video
Ai and I'm going to tell you why they
probably shouldn't be that's not that
bad yeah $181
it's a pretty good price for a
phone all right so after we talk about
onee 6.1 bringing AI features to more
Galaxy devices as you can see here we
got the Z folds here so it's going to
launch on the s23 series the tab S9
series and the Z fold and flip 5 series
unfortunately doesn't look like it's
going to be coming to the s22 series so
I'm going to actually have to get an
upgrade to get a feature so that's it's
kind of sad but whatever um so it's
going to have the communication live
translation technology I'm hoping it
brings yes yes it brings the AI notes
apps oh that's gonna be so great because
you actually have to pay for features
like that um at least this feature is
free up until 2025 I think might stay
freeing um what else and then AI photo
and edit suggestion and instant slow
motion with uh frames in it yeah me I
don't really get the fear of AI it's uh
in my opinion it's kind of stupid if you
think about
it now let's talk about Ai and Sora and
how AI generated video is not that big
of a problem like okay AI generated
video as you can see from Sora I can
take you to their homepage um open AI
generates great cinematic quality video
okay obviously that's going to be a
turnoff
right let's say I wanted a fake say uh
High School fight happening in the
bathroom right if I type that in the
Sora right first of all it's not going
to use any of the people who actually go
to my school and second of all it it
won't work because it's cinematic
quality all the lighting and
everything's like perfect okay if
anybody knows anything about videos
recorded by people they're not perfect
first of all Sora generates vertical
okay most people for some reason
generate landscape
right okay second of all no one has a
cinematic quality phone at all because
they don't really exist okay and it's
not like you'd be able to set up the
lights for it anyway so if I wanted to
fake like an actual event it's useless
okay it's great for animation and like
movies and stuff like that because you
want people to believe that you spent
money and and had good quality on this
and it's going to probably help people
to make better movies who don't have
that much money money let's say a
Christian movie studio that doesn't get
that much funding will be able to make a
good animated uh movie that teach
students about the Bible and that looks
you know halfway decent or they'll make
a good plot or good backgrounds or you
can use as your green screen background
and it'll look more realistic in some
stock uh background to say of someone
skiing right but it is going to be hard
to generate cell phone quality so like
1080p well I mean those were
fiction like 1080p
um 1080p quanity like it's not going to
generate 1080p quantity for you and it's
not going to get those like weird
Reflections or like maybe your thumb
covers the screen or anything it's going
to look too perfect and because it's
going to look too perfect everyone's
going to know it's fake so as long as
people are respons yeah
well when let's look at this AI s this
is the best of their technology that
they can make and it's not out yet but I
mean look at this does anyone believe
that this is
real like maybe you can say this is like
a stock video off of pixels or something
like
that but like you can't get that on your
phone and that's how most 95% of videos
are shot so if I wanted to fake a video
I can't be like oh yeah I so yesterday I
was Tokyo and I saw this no one's going
to believe me cuz I am not a movie star
and I don't have a movie uh quality the
camera just running around with me or
this obviously no one's going to believe
this because uh these have been extinct
for like the past 4,000
years like the worst that could happen
is maybe uh someone open sources this
and they make fake movie clips from like
popular movies
yeah unfortunately you cannot I've tried
with some other ones and they're not as
good like maybe what you Happ is you can
make fake movie clips which but like on
on the grounds of making fake things
like say fake
um like fake fights or fake
um fake that car crash or something like
it's not going to work like you can't
like generate that cam quality video
it's not going to work like that um
yeah like maybe you can say oh I got
this for my drone but they're gon be
like your drone was it cost like
$33,000 and obviously this is animated
so that's how this could be used for
movies and obviously this is fake I mean
he's literally sitting on a
cloud kind of looks like MKBHD in my
opinion
no no I guess you could say that the
danger would be fake images but we've
been a of fake images since like 1990
with photos
like maybe you could fake two people
together who actually went together like
standing next to each other or whatever
and I've been able to like fake a
background of something with image but
even then the reflections aren't right
and maybe with AI it will get a tad bit
better you know like fake images easy
fake videos that look like you took them
on your phone hard because
you you it is generating like cinematic
quality video so I don't see really see
how this is a problem the real problem
would be like people using it to replace
movie studios which is in my opinion
fine because like if we didn't keep
progressing with technology in terms of
movies we still be using film cameras
and editing by cutting the film out and
pasting it in with uh sticks I mean not
sticks with with uh glue sticks and tape
okay and that's that's obviously not
that's obviously not going to work like
that okay so we're going to have
progress and with this progress you're
going to get new jobs like in 2015 there
was no movie studio job that was
generate the prompt for this right you
had to go there and film it yourself
your fashion way for like an actual
camera right and now maybe you don't
have to go there and film it yourself
with an actual camera but you do have to
um figure out your
own prompt generation and PR generation
is going to be inherently
human it's kind of like how these clips
they kind of like manipulated and stuff
like that like you could manipulate
video by editing it and stuff like
clipping it together make someone say
something that they shouldn't be saying
or didn't say and like as Mr whiter said
in EV ly in the writer of Revelations
like anyone who can do that referring to
making a fake imagination St can
certainly manipulate the recordings on a
phone right
the worst recording manipulation could
do is maybe like make fake movie clips
maybe make fake political ads because
those are well produced but that's
already illegal like you can't use AI
generated verion of a politician to say
something uh that they didn't
say um in at least specific
States um or like say I'm blah blah blah
and I approve this message um you can't
do
that
so yeah I don't really think that Zora
is a danger to society nor do I think
Apple's Vis Pro is a danger to society
it's only like an overprice I mean it is
overpriced it's kind of useless um yeah
right now let's talk about lock bit
which apparently was a hacker ransomware
gang that infected millions of computers
including uh mailing machines worldwide
in in the
UK and
the multi governments uh the EU actually
did something right for once the US
government um the UK's government um um
like multiple Western governments came
together and hacked them and trolled
them after making a few
arrests listen there's a good chance
somebody trying to hack your website
right now you got all right here we what
would it look like for the feds to hack
the world's number one cyber crime gang
completely destroy their operation and
then troll them into Oblivion well
you're about to find out because that's
exactly what happened to lock bit the
world's most formidable rans 19
initially under so they came out
September 2019 so just like five years
ago just before Co the name ABCD
ransomware which is kind of like stupid
like
but doesn't that even but quickly
realizing just how awful of a name that
was a few months later they've rebranded
under the now iconic name lock bit that
sounds and their logo looks like
authentic it looks like maybe a cyber
security firm maybe a tool that you can
use to like reset your Windows password
or something like that in many ways lock
bit works the same way as any other
ransomware group after a victim's files
were encrypted a ransom note would Point
them to a dark website with the negot
would begin and just like other groups
lock bit operated on an affiliate model
meaning the core could you imagine
becoming an affiliate being like this
video is sponsored by lock
bit lock bit team would only handle
developing the malware maintaining the
dark website and negotiation with
victims whereas other cyber bad guys
could sign up to be Affiliates tasked
with the job of actually hacking into
companies and infecting them for their
efforts Affiliates could look forward to
an 80% cut of Ransom however the big
problem between and ransomware gangs is
one of trust how do you know the gang is
80% that is a lot of money just for like
infecting a computer with Ransom whe
even going to pay you your share after
all everyone's a criminal here lock
bit's Innovation was to make it so it's
the affiliate who collects The Ransom
from the victim only after Affiliates
were paid would they send lock bits
their slice of the pie it's kind of dumb
like what if lockit I could care about
them got scammed by the Affiliates what
if say I became an affiliate right and
took the money from the person right and
they got reset and then I gave the money
back to the person so that
[Music]
um I was effectively robbing lock bit
well I guess it wouldn't matter because
I put the softw on there
so maybe I could like extort myself so
like waste their time trust problem was
solved Lo bits also had the fastest
encryption in the game the group posted
this comparison showing that their
encryption was way faster than the
competition and this wasn't just for
bragging rights in many ways ransomware
gangs have to compete for Affiliates
they have to give them a reason to
choose their group over other ransomware
operations after all without their
Affiliates gangs don't make any money in
2021 barely a single year after they
formed the group came third in global
ransomware infections wow
congratulations to them I guess
but they didn't stop there in 2022 the
group rebranded as lock bits 3.0 what
happened at two their leak sites got a
new design and they came up with yet
more Innovations one of which was the
first ever malicious bug Bounty program
offering anywhere from 1,000 to a
million dollars for web wow that's a lot
of money which is that technically
illegal like to give a bug to a cyber
criminal um I mean they might patch it
right you could say you could argue that
you didn't know that they were criminals
like it looks like that website's on to
clear that website bugs that could help
them hack new victims bugs in their
encryption tools or even bugs in talks
the messaging platform that the group
relies on to stay hidden the owner of
lock bit a guy who goes by lock bits up
even put a bounty on himself posting on
a Russian cyber if the government
um exploited the vulnerability didn't
tell anybody he did got the money from
them after telling them of the patch
after they were already hacked that be
kind of funny for him that he was
willing to pay a million dollars to
anyone who could uncover his real
identity fast forward to 2022 and the
group had grown further by the middle of
the Year America side the Defense Agency
declared that log bit had taken the
crown as the world's most deployed
ransomware variant accounting for 40%
what do you guys think of cesa of
ransomware attacks worldwide the group
is widely considered to be so successful
because of how business oriented they
were lock bits tried to stay away from
drama in a world where there's oh so
many big personalities and cyber crime
the group even experimented with
different ways of making money other
than giving the victim the option to pay
the ransom in full they could pay a
small fee to extend the deadline for
another 24
hours it's kind of dumb wait like and
there was the constant threat of the
option for anyone to come along and pay
the ransom at any time giving them the
ability to download all the stolen data
no one was safe from Lock bit the group
developed their tools not only for
$29,000 isn't that much to have like
access to millions of companies
computers wonder if any governments
bought that data windows but Linux and
they were the first ransomware group to
specifically Target Mac OS however on
occasion the group deviated from their
business oriented reputation in one case
in some kind of bizarre marketing
campaign or maybe they just did it for
for the ls lock bits offered $11,000 to
anyone who got their logo tattooed on
their body and over 20 people actually
ended up taking them up on that offer I
do that
um on a fake like arm and then post a
video and send it to them now you don't
become the world's number one ransomware
gang without some pretty high-profile
hacks some of their victims include tsmc
Boeing and even the UK hey maybe that's
why I want do a wings of off the Govern
Wood's National Postal Service Royal
Mail lock bit of the reason why even
months after the Royal Mail hack you
still can't use the selfservice checkout
machines to post internationally yeah
those are the things I was talking about
might sound like a small detail but as
someone who sends a bunch of
international mail it's incredibly
annoying thanks lock bit by the end of
2023 lock bit had reached a status few
cyber criminal gangs could even dream of
in total they'd received over a hundred
million in Ransom payments it's a lot of
money it's just tried to become a
quarterbacks much more
legal it's and uh you'll make more money
if you're good but just like those that
came before them lock bit's days were
numbered guys with bad
jeans are they worth it jeans go with
everything they go with
nothing on the morning of February 19th
of 2024 Affiliates logged into lock
dashboard they had done countless times
before they were why are they log me in
on a Windows 7 computer greeted with a
message hello law enforcement has taken
control of lock bit's platform and
obtained all the information held on
there this information relates to the
lock bits group and you their Affiliates
you can thank lock bit up and their
flawed infrastructure for this situation
we may be in touch with you very soon in
the meantime we would encourage you to
visit the lock bit leak site have a nice
day overnight a coalition of law
enforcement agents we got the
UK the doj
the FBI had launched Operation Kronos
led by the UK's NCA National Crime
agency they'd hacked 34 of lock bit you
po servers grabbed source code chat logs
and orchestrated arrests but best of all
the feds have given us a masterclass in
trolling in a way I've never seen before
you're going to love this instead of
just Plastering a lot look at all the
countries we got here uh is that Japan
Canada I think that's New
Zealand Finland
Sweden UK US France
Germany I don't know what that
is p oit site with a standard boring old
seizure page the feds decided to have
some fun humiliating lock bits by
replacing their trophy wall of victims
with details of all the they got the
press release okay they got the EU us
UK uh another us all these us
um
Ukraine already arrested someone in
Ukraine
Poland was it
France
joh law enforcement actions against them
the attention to detail here is simply
amazing they modified lock bit's logo
and even went to the effort of editing
the site's loading animation to showcase
the countries behind the logo and even
went them the attention to detail here
is simply amazing they modified bit's
logo and even went to the effort of
editing the logo me see you guys have to
see
this the s's loading amazing they
modified lock bit's logo and even went
to the effort of editing the site's
loading animation to showcase the
countries behind the takedown they also
cap the iconic lock that they had so
much time on their hand they were
recoding their
website this is a randomware gang that
got hacked by um 30 different um Western
governments in effort to help the people
and then they made the arrest based on
the information that they
had countdown timers counting down to
the moments law enforcement is
apparently going to reveal the identity
of the group's leader look you can see
how many people looked at it what's it
30 31,000 wow lock bits up in one
section the NCA leaked screenshots of
lock bits admin console chat logs
showing negotiations with victims and
wait they kept their chat logs on their
computers
even a screenshot of the server's Shadow
file the shadow file is a file on Linux
systems that contains password hashes
it's pretty high value so to be able to
access it you typically need root level
permissions so the fact the NCA was able
to grab a screenshot of it is pretty bad
news for lock bits in fact the NCA
actually named the file this is really
bads PNG thanks to those admin
privileges law enforcement was able to
grab the usernames of all 194 Affiliates
o they kept their names on fire
it's kind of like that episode of
project MC squared where I switched all
the server space it's it's not really
good hacking good hacking TV show where
s all their server cyber operations the
computers from off from defensive and
offensive like a split so to all
offensive so they can attack someone's
computer and well through the IP address
to track their location not that good
hack whatever but then because of that
the bad guys were able to hack into
their servers because their defensive
systems are turned off for a minute and
grab all the the names and pictures of
all their worldwide
agents it's kind of dumb why would you
keep all your names on a file on a sofa
like you're gonna get hecked a video of
one of those Affiliates being arrested
was released by polish police Operation
Kronos seems to have gone about as well
as law enforcement could have
realistically expected they were even
able to grab decryption keys and are
making those available to vict
there's even a whole section in
here what's up hi J we brought you here
today to
let dedicated to Simply taunting log
bits after they got them banned on
various cyber crime forums but all this
raises the question what made this
takedown possible rumors suggest this
was all down to a known PHP
vulnerability in lock bit servers that
they just hadn't bothered to patch this
was imagine being a went to hackers and
you forget the um they forget
to they forget to switch S they for get
their pets to own software like it's
kind of sad Alber confirmed in an
interview with loitz leader who said
that the FBI NCA and Euro are not
skilled pentesters and their success was
only due to their administrator's
laziness the group's leader lock bits up
is also calling BS on his upcoming docs
saying he's willing to double the FBI's
$10 million bounty on his head to $20
million if they're able to successfully
identify him he posted it on X which we
got to talk about uh he posted it on X X
Elon mus be able to track this guy come
on man the least surprising news out of
all of this is that there just hasn't
been much sympathy from rival ransomware
gangs the leader of the AL gang for
example how are they able to post on X
like I know it's a fre speed platform
and everything like I know it's
completely fine but like how are you not
able to
didn't have anything nice to say this
should their moms if you don't have
anything nice to say you don't see
anything at all be the end of lock bit
however the reality is that despite the
group's infrastructure having been
completely taken over and all the data
that comes with that there's only been
three or four arrests across Europe and
a further five lock bit Affiliates have
been indicted in the US the vast
majority of the couple hundred
Affiliates will likely never see Justice
and are free to Simply join a different
ransomware gang maybe they'll use a
different name you know as for the
countdown to the reveal of lockit Subs
identity law enforcement finally
published the page with all been waiting
for who is lock bit up he claims to live
in the US he doesn't he claims to live
in the Netherlands he doesn't he um I'm
not a geography expert but I'm pretty
good at it but I can I can assure you
that the United States does not border
the Netherlands no he's trying to say
that like a military base which he
claims to drive Lambo he drives a
Mercedes though parts may be half to
Source an obvious reference to the
sanctions on Russia making life hard for
the car industry so the implication here
is that the guy lives in Russia but
that's not much of a revelation I mean
it's known that pretty much most
ransomware gangs are based in Russia the
feds go on to say that they know who he
is where he lives and how much he's
worth didn't didn't get
him and uh I went and posted you nobody
he lives you know he he he could move
just like he moved from the US to the
Netherlands when they were bordering
each other at the same time he must have
been using like a VPN he kept switching
locations they also claim he's quote
engaged with law enforcement but it's
not oh okay not clear what that means If
the Fed does that mean he's like
marrying them or something we're truly
certain of his identity why isn't he on
the list of ss got married to them be
kind of funny a really good homwork
movie perhaps this means he's become an
FBI asset and is somehow working with
law enforcement but if that was the case
it doesn't sound like the kind of thing
the feds what is this graic is that just
some want to advertise I have no idea on
this one and I'm starting to feel like
where the ones being trolled but if you
have any ideas feel free to let me know
down in those comments this all right so
that is our YouTube uh reaction for
today I need to go check something so
you guys can uh keep
watching
all right guys I am back all right
so we also have another YouTube video
from M who's the
boss and have you ever noticed how if
you try to make an emoji come up oton
come up on your Windows computer using
Windows TV um or the onscreen
keyboard I know U the US flag is not
Indo and sometimes it doesn't even
display on YouTube but other flags do
it's kind of
weird okay here we go it is a YouTube
short and we're gonna be talking
about here we
go $50 fake iPhone $400 fake iPhone how
close can they get to the real thing
at100 starting with the $50 one
underneath the phone you've got a cable
plug earphones even a clear case within
that's more than you get with the real
iPhone all you get is a cable in the
phone you'll be lucky to get some
packaging booted screen protector then
the phone man the amount of plastic film
on this thing that's un booxed a $400
fee well the packaging went from blank
box to Super convincing the $50 one
feels a lot cheaper than look at that
look at those fake camer it doesn't have
an Apple logo everything is made of
plasticas one of those is real the $400
fake feels very similar like even down
to the glass on the back and the shiny
metal rails on the sides so this is the
$50 phone it does feel pretty budget the
animation look at that Notch and then
just calls it the dynamic Island it
looks like that an LG from six years ago
but the bottom B also are even
worse look you can see it study when I
app
it voice search and you can tell this is
in the real iPhone not from this or this
or this it has an fmo video even the
real iPhone doesn't have that aren't
nearly as smooth this bottom bezel is
absolutely massive abomination of a
dynamic Island happening on top and the
camera yikes is that the Samsung gallery
logo the $400 fake is a lot more
convincing much more bearable bezels
YouTube do kind of it looks like a
graphic side a much higher quality
screen too the dynamic Island looks less
like an April fall show hey you can have
the same swipe down to search let's find
out the quality of this camera why is
that basically just as good I wasn't
meant to yeah he look kind of more
washed out in your
image all right we also
have lots of other things to talk
about fun fact I was reading
a a um plugged in review of a movie
because I saw clip online of it and um
the the movie was so bad apparently was
rated all or something it was so bad
that the plugged in review this is focus
on the family by the way plugged in
review like the same people who make
adventures and odyssey Family Life today
you know great Christian content the
pluged in review if I read it live on a
could potentially be considered PG13 or
allr itself just because of the content
in the movie that's kind of
said all right oh we got to talk about
this Android
headline so I was reading Android
headlines today and they talking about
how the s24 is a really plus is a really
good phone you know I like the s24 plus
I have an s22 plus so it' be a great
upgrade for my phone I always going to
upgrade I want I want to have sty this
you know and since all those AI features
coming to the next uh next uh last
year's phone maybe I just get ult what
do you think s23 Ultra or s24 plus which
one do you think is the better
buy voice and video calls are coming to
X and they might even make
xmail which could you imagine having an
xmail xmail decom domain that just be
kind of weird wait what does it say the
Bible has each stuff in it what what
does that mean oh thanks for reminding
me of another video we have to
watch oh the Bible has racy stuff in it
uh yeah it wasn't as bad as the movie uh
review I've never seen the movie
obviously um and
uh it also doesn't have any foul
language in it anyway X is getting voice
and video calls coming to the public
it's on IOS and Android I don't have the
app so can't do anything for me um and
you will get different
features so you can
have enhance call privacy which blocks
your IP address from showing up in the
call just like in WhatsApp calls but you
have to turn that on
um if you want to call someone they
would have to see send a DM which stands
for a direct message I believe to you
previously and you can also do video
calling um
but previously you had to pay but you
could call a free user as well and if
you're on Android you have to enable
push notifications now you can have said
it to make sure that only people who you
follow or on blue or on other features
like have called you before not called
you message you before can call you or
you can just be called anyone on the
internet which would be kind of weird um
for any random person on the internet
just be able to call you but whatever um
so now it's becoming the everything chat
application it's kind of like Instagram
if you think about it Instagram started
off as simple Photoshop sharing
application and now it's a messaging
application and a calling application
it's actually some people like children
kids primary messaging application which
I find insane I only mess let me see one
two three people okay not counting like
business messages um like request for
comments on stories and stuff or product
testing it's really important to be able
to product to S messages people to
product
test and Kate reminded me cuz to the B
oh hey let's watch npt you know npt is
celebrating her n9y year anniversary of
being a tech YouTuber she started Tech
youtubing at the age of 16 which was
around the age when I started but I
started when I was 13 um the the
website so wait she's 25 I don't think
she started when she's 16 I think she's
only 24 so maybe is
[Music]
15 like after like say six to seven
video she's already coming out to other
countries and companies and like Google
and stuff like maybe like 60 of video
something like that so she did well for
and this is the OnePlus 12r this phone
cost $899 and this phone cost $499 I'm
noticing that the 12 R looks like the
camera bump is less both are oneplus's
attempt at regaining like the Flagship
killer title so in today's real Day Life
review we're going to be testing them
out in a lot of crucial imagine using
two phones just walking around have a
whole camera crew with
you and we're gonna see what you lose
when you switch from the OnePlus 12 to
the 12 R also this is Turkish coffee one
of my favorite types of coffee and the
first camera test is going to be pour in
it pretty stable video in my
opinion so the first difference is that
the OnePlus 12 has a slightly larger
display H I thought this might have been
the 12 H because it doesn't look CED
maybe that that wall wallpaper makes it
look
bad but yeah I like a bigger display but
usually more expensive phones are
smaller 82 in versus 6.78 in that's
barely noticeable unless you have like
yeah but this looks like it's wi so
that's nice and it also has more pixels
per inch at 510 pixel per inch versus
450 both look really sharp and are very
fast but if you're really looking this
phone definitely looks a little bit
sharper and also has a higher Max
brightness usually they switch it like
this may have more pixels per inch
because there's less inches and more
pixels you can put on there and it's
more spread out but I guess this for a
better Den screen dens resolution and
stuff is really nice for outdoor use and
the build of the phones is also a little
different the 12 has this really
interesting like almost marble like back
but I actually prefer the 12r a little
bit more because I hate that camera like
the bump or anything it's just like the
holes of the camera they look fake like
a phone that you buy off a t- because
it's cheaper than say the this is so
smooth that it's slippery it would like
slip out of my pant or pocket whereas
this has a little bit more texture even
though it's just glass both look really
nice though and they both have a very
similar this looks like a attract more
fingerprints though this looks like
camera design although the 12's camera
is bigger and they're also spec
differences between them that we'll test
throughout the day beautiful day in New
York it's still winter but there's a
little bit of sun going on um and that's
actually a clutch for the regular I
thought she lived in Dallas at one time
because I think her name is Jacqueline
Dallas I was like wait do you live in
Dallas or is your last name Dallas plus
12 because it has a bit of a brighter
screen it apparis to the 12 R and in
normal environments you oh yeah isn't
the 12 phone that has a 4,500 nit screen
I mean you could probably take that
thing to you to the Moon with
you that but when you're outside this is
really where that difference comes
[Music]
alive on the way to a spot in the city
that we have never been before inspired
by the good weather and also the fact
that the OnePlus 12 I mean New York is
America's larer City so I'm pretty sure
there's multiple places he's never been
has a telephoto lens but the 12 doesn't
and I want to compare the
two no teoto o but it is only 500 so
other difference is that the OnePlus 12r
has a 5500 M battery and the OnePlus 12
has a 5400 milliamp battery so the
OnePlus 12 has a dedicated telephoto
setup so you can get 3x optical zoom
which is worse than other flags on the
market that we've tested like the s24
ultra or even the pixel 8 Pro but it's
better than the regular oh today I saw
someone with an S21 22 something like
that and a pixel 7 and then an iPhone
three people so if I was like a like a
idealistic type like random blogger you
know the type I'm talking about I'll be
like this this is so great for
competition it inspired a new day for
America as two people but I just found
it interesting um that I saw two Android
phones and one iOS phone in the same
group 12 which doesn't have that and you
can really see the difference here it oh
yeah oh she's on Wall Street she's never
been there before this looks like from
like an old phone and this looks like
pretty
good like you can probably extract some
text from there this is like barely
usable now again the price anchor is
$4.99 which is a signicant difference I
think for that price it's actually like
this the kind of video I'm saying that
you can't be able to fake with a text to
text to video generator like Sora it's
not going to be able to generate say
video shot off of a cheap uh Android
phone that you f that you found on te or
something like
that good cameras they both have 50
megapixel main cameras but the actual
sensor is different so on paper if you
hear like oh 50 megapixel I think it'd
be easy to assume that it's the same but
it's not it's a different sensor and
we're going to test one with the c sizes
that as we got on this Ferry right now
this is such a beautiful day in New York
getting all the serotonin from it um and
also they both have Ultra wide so
OnePlus I mean most budget phones have
Ultra
wide I think your 813 also has Ultra
wide as well 12 has a higher megapixel
Ultra wide 48 megapixels versus 8 o yeah
that going be bu use again pretty big
camera differences honestly like I think
if you were a user optimizing for like
great camera you're honestly probably
going to buy a Samsung or a pixel phone
but if you were looking at this price
range OnePlus then obviously the OnePlus
12 is better than the 12 Bar some people
be offended by that statement saying
that like you don't want to buy OnePlus
with camera and I'm not
sure we're on the ferry right now this
is definitely one of the coolest things
I've done in New York recently and as
we're testing out the cameras something
that's super evident is the fact that
the OnePlus 12 has a dedicated telephoto
lens actually really matters especially
for video mode it goes 3x optically and
then it 18x which uses a combination 18
you couldn't make it to 20 like 18x like
back one has thir 30 times Zoom with the
3x camera and it's from two years ago so
I mean that's
unacceptable Optical and digital well
it's not the sharp thing in the world
the OnePlus 12r maxes out at 10s and
it's almost unusable important to
mention here that there is a significant
price difference but if you're all about
the camera and the zoom quality then the
OnePlus 12 definitely has the edge the
overall best zoom camera that I've ever
used is in a recent day in life video
the s24 ultra but that's also several
hundred dollars more expensive so it
feels like OnePlus really prioritized
like main camera primary camera photos
and then gave the 12 zoom in case you
need it another thing that I've noticed
on the ferry is that the 12 fin it's
kind of more of a s24 plus competitor um
like my 22 plus cost around $8.99 when
it came
out is super shimmery like they added
kind of a glitter and when it hits the
direct sunlight it's really evident
we're pulling up to Governor's Island
right now so this timing was perfect for
the
take is this an aling
most people use their smartphone cameras
to either take pictures of themselves or
take pictures of other people or scenery
so test number
one what else would they take pictures
of most people use their phone cameras
to take pictures of themselves other
people in scenery oh yeah okay so what
what's what else is there uh pets and
maybe objects if you don't count that as
scening like that's
it one is going to be a portra mod shot
of meing by maybe just Stars I don't
know oh one thing that we both notice is
when you're taking a photo or a video on
both these phones on the viewfinder as
you're taking it it does not look that
great actually it kind of looks low res
and then when it processes a lot of the
detail comes back so it either has
excellent post-processing or they're
showing like a lower res version to save
on processing power on the phone which
is interesting that definitely is a case
it's interesting but it's not good like
want to get a good shot and it's not
showing well on other phones as well
like on the iPhone or the pixel um once
you take a photo it often looks better
after the processing but the contrast
here is very
real she to tries taking a screenshot to
show
us it's 3:44 p.m. the next shuttle comes
at 400 p.m. so we have a little time to
kill we're in this like art gallery area
an important note that is different
between these that's more of a subtle
difference is the water resistance
rating the OnePlus 12 has an ip6
vibrating versus ip54 on the regular 12r
so if you're planning to use your phone
in an environment where it rains a lot
or there's more of a chance of getting
submerged the 12 is definitely a little
bit more durable um another difference
is actually in the camera Tech the
front-facing camera is higher megapixel
on the 12 and also just like the overall
exposure dynamic range looks better on
the 12 and the OnePlus KR also gets a
macro dedicated lens that's only 2
megapixels but it helps with some depth
information versus the 12 what it
doesn't have that it's kind of weird how
they add lenses like a death camera or a
macro lens to the cheap phones but not
to the more extensive phones of course I
like a more upgraded version of it but
it's kind of weird how I could take
micro photos on my a71 but not really on
my s22 plus but because it's primary
sensor is so good honestly they look
very similar for close-up shots for
traveling a lot or even a day trip
another thing you really notice is how
heavy or light your phone is and there
is a little bit of a weight difference
here but it's not huge the 1pl 12 is 220
gram and the 12r is 2 seven gr it's a
little bit lighter and you feel that
difference but if I wasn't holding both
them at the same time I wouldn't
notice it's 9:54 p.m. I'm going to a
Tech Community mixer right now and the
over what is a Tech Community
mix what's a mix honestly I feel like
one has done a lot right here kind of
looks like what do you think is selfie I
mean her cheeks look more red but they
do look kind kind of grainy there so
maybe this is better we're getting that
flash pillar status um the main drawback
that I see is that it has less software
updates um four and three years
respectively than other flag phones yeah
it was basically the standard until two
two months ago it's important for
longevity um and the camera performance
is worse but for the price I feel like
there is a lot of value here if you want
to check out another day in life you can
click right here nope nope nope that's a
test in the
video and with all the talk about AI
image generation being bad and racist
and everything of Google's Gemini I
wanted to show you this video that I
saw it is
a where is
it they're going to generate iPhones not
iPhones
uh angels using AI with descriptions
from the Bible from Mark Whitman he's a
guy who goes around and visits lots of
churches and indes
people my favorite beef sticks are from
paleo Valley they are 100% grass here we
go
whatever like what I picture when I
think of angels let's just let's do the
exercise here you and me what do you
picture when you hear the word Angel
since I can't hear you because the one
way nature of the medium I'm just hey
look I'm watching a video on a phone on
a computer with a TV in the background
guess what you're thinking right now one
you're either picturing a little chubby
baby angel with bow and arrow that looks
kind of like cupid I think we all know
that angel isn't really in the Bible
anywhere or you're picturing maybe a
more biblically accurate version of an
Angel which would be the tough masculine
looking robed or armored almost Soldier
or messenger angel with the great big
wings the huge wingspan and the sword
and they yeah I I don't think that's
biblically accurate uh from a prey from
a Japanese anime I'm not sure I look
like a person but maybe they glow a
little bit I don't think we get that
exact description anywhere in the Bible
but that representation is sort of a
composite of a bunch of the details that
we
from other encounters around the Bible
with more relat humanlike Angels there
are clearly a bunch of different kinds
of angels presented in the Bible the
we're running here in Ezekiel is the
most mentioned type by name and also
definitely in the running for the most
alien type of Angel in the Bible these
are called
cherubim now a cherub is the first Angel
we see in the Bible it's the one that
guards the Garden of Eden Lucifer is
described in Ezekiel 28 as being a chub
it's going to melt our brains here in a
minute when we look at the actual
description of what oh get into the AI
generation they start taking promising
young men from Judea as sort of hostages
and Ezekiel is one of these promising
young men it gets taken as a hostage
probably along with Daniel Shadrach
mesak
and and the book starts with him sitting
on the banks of a river near Babylon
Vision how the hand of the Lord is upon
him and he has this incred really wanted
to give us something that was sort of
shadowy and obscured by fire and smoke I
think it was kind of ducking it like
what I used to do when I was learning to
draw and I wasn't sure how to make hands
so I just always put like a mitten right
there a book but still it gives you a
sense you imagine being Ezekiel even at
this point already pretty sure I saw
that image from a Becca I
think how do you even relay what you've
just seen how can you you have four
faces well we'll let the description go
on under their wings on their four Sid
okay so he's reading the description
from the Bible it had the hands of a man
all four of them had faces and wings and
their wings touched one another each one
went straight ahead they didn't turn as
they moved so I think he's describing a
movement pattern that would be a little
bit odd in the ancient world but we're
talking about linear movement while
continuing to Face Forward almost
gyroscopic is that the right word it's
like when you play a firsters video game
don't tune out if you're not into this
kind of thing but if you are you're
going to know what I'm talking about you
got two joysticks to control movement
one takes you forward back side to side
the other one pivots what is straight
ahead so hey it's like those video games
from aveng and odyssey you have these
two axes and that allows you to navigate
through the world somewhat like you
navigate through the real world it
almost sounds like he's describing
something like that maybe just with one
of the two control sticks uh maybe I'm
reaching at this point let's keep going
their faces looked like this each of the
four interesting what was this I wish he
showed us what the uh generation
software he was using
and I fin L video game cost 14.99
oh my
gosh faces had the face of a man and on
the right side the face of a lion and on
the left side the face of an ox each
also had the face of an eagle their
wings were spread out upward each had
two Wings one touching the wing of
another creature on either side and
two you didn't say what kind of creature
this one was what is that two Wings
covering its body each one went straight
ahead wherever the spirit would go they
would go without turning as they went
the appearance of the living creatur
what software did he use for this look
at that sun was like burning coals of
fire or like torches fire moved back and
forth among the creatures it was bright
and lightning flashed out of it the
looks like a seen from moving creatures
sped back and forth like flashes of
lightning as I looked at the living
creatures I saw a wheel on the ground
beside each creature with its four faces
this was the appearance and structure of
the wheels they sparkled like chrysite I
don't what that is and all four looked
alike each appeared to be made like a
wheel intersecting a Wheels as they
moved they would go in any one of four
directions the creatures faced the
wheels did not turn about as the
creatures went their rims were high and
awesome and all four rims were full of
eyes
all whoa
interesting around when the living
creatures moved this a really
interesting Sunday school R you know how
I don't like to say oh the Bible's
interesting on everything this would
show you like how
interesting that would
be the wheels beside them moved and when
the living creatures Rose from the
ground the wheels also Rose wherever the
spirit would go they would go and the
wheels would rise along with them
because the spirit of the living
creatures was in the wheels when the
creatures moved they also moved when the
creatures Stood Still They also stood
still and when the creatures Rose from
the ground the wheels rose with them
because the spirit of the living
creatures was in the wheels then it goes
on to describe sort of a Celestial
litter not like trash or like a bunch of
little kittens that are born but like
the what s that in the ancient world
servants would carry someone of high
rank upon and it seems to be suggesting
that the glory of God is residing on a
throne on this Celestial litter as he is
being moved about you got Ezekiel there
he's barely able to take this in and
over the next 10 chapters God starts
laying out all the ways that his chosen
people have violated their Covenant
their relationship with God God's
presence has been physically manifest as
being with his people for centuries it
was there in the desert wanderings and
exodus fire and smoke after that it was
there in the Ark of the Covenant it was
there when the temple was dedicated
400ish years before the events we're
reading about here but the passage ends
with God showing Ezekiel a vision of his
presence in the form of a Dark Cloud
coming up out of the temple in Jerusalem
and moving away from his people
indicating God isn't going to live with
his people anymore in that way all right
so let's try this experiment ourselves
I'm going to go to the m
ming and uh kind of beat up um by the
media Gemini AI you know I'm pretty sure
it could use a
friend which uh speaking of Gemini Ai
and friendship and everything like this
there's a problem with this Google
Assistant Google Assistant which is Clos
the Gemini AI had a
personality it was like if I asked her
what his favorite food was or what it
like to do for fun or what it like to
eat it could it would answer those
questions I think it's favorite food was
like Vault it could tell jokes and stuff
like that but Gemini if you ask what it
favorite food is it it doesn't have one
it's like as I don't have a favorite
food and that's gonna be a problem like
that's that's half of Google Assistant
Trump asking and answering questions
that's what we like you do the virtual
assistance for uh Alexa you could ask
questions it would sing songs for you
and predict who's going to win the Super
Bowl and joke about those people if um
if if these if what's Google assistants
replacement loses its personality is
losing half its features kids won want
to use it but without further Ado let's
go to uh oh
oh okay we're still up okay
um all right let's go to
um oh speaking of video games I need to
talk about this new app for Android it's
not new it's new wish okay um where were
we oh yes
Ezekiel
so right now I'm pulling up Ezekiel
depictions of Angels in a very bad oh
wow got it okay so we have the thing up
um and Google's AI generated uh pulled
it up for us so thank you Google um here
we
go I'm going to say generate an
image all right here we go into
Google I'm going to say
a
and hopefully he doesn't think it's a
person because it's been blocked because
if
it's
racism
okay here we go oh only three images
okay here we go here's
one we got the cow I think that's a cow
Ox
okay
lion why do have two faces it's kind of
weird what's
this I don't know what that is oh maybe
that's supposed to be a bird that's
interesting and just before we leave we
got to talk about how um Google
um yeah well I guess we can talk about
it next week so I forgot God bless take
talk to you
later</pre>
