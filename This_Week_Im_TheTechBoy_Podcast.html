<h1>This Week Im TheTechBoy Podcast</h1>
<pre>well modesty War 3 is over and is Maria
Deca and Court Den Neil have won um so
gate season is now officially over face
of power at B and now speaking of face
of power at B watch that sound you he is
millions of 13 the 18yearold white girls
singing in patriotism as president-elect
Donald Trump says uh as for stay order
on the Tik Tock ban so patriotism is
abound in America and and that is the
national anthem you hear being sung as
millions of children in little lons are
doing qu Wheels while holding and
singing their standy cups as patriotism
in the United States has gone up over
100% so Tik Tok may not be banned and
teenage girls are happy congratulations
but we have to talk about who's still
going to buy Tik Tok because they still
have to get bought who's gonna buy them
who knows anyway um so yeah who who will
buy Tik Tok that is the number one topic
of discussion for
today but
um here we go let's let's show this onto
the screen who will um who will buy Tik
Tock so guys in the comments in the chat
to tell me who do you think will buy Tik
Tok look at the graphic on the screen
over from uh Instagram every 13 to 18
year old girl right now say you see uh
Trump urges Supreme Court to hit pause
on the looming Tik Tock ban so obviously
Tik Tok will still get bought Tik Tok
will probably still get sold oh my gosh
we already have chat hello door um yep
we had a great Christmas and Merry
Christmas to um each and every one of
you as well so yeah Tik Tock will not
get banned maybe maybe not who
knows um but as patriotism Reigns in the
United States let's see what happens
says imagine if Elon Musk buys Tik Tok
well Elon Musk and V Mami are now in
some type of xw over there and they
blamed it on boy meet wal which is
apparently also a topic of discourse
that we'll have after this
anyway back to the thing so I did a list
of companies last night I was thinking
about this and I was thinking about the
top companies I might buy it so let's
let's start with X I don't think X will
do it if they did it they might rename
it to Vines but I mean X is probably in
debt I mean he paid over $40 million
just to buy the platform now and of
course advertis is left so I don't think
um X will buy Tik Tok all right snap
snap is probably in debt so I don't
think they'll buy Tik Tok but they
should okay snap's wheels are awful okay
snap's wheels are the equivalent of I
mean literally okay you can swipe
through it is uh you know Sophie Wayne
which no one cares about it and um you
know uh some fat woman walking around a
mall literally that's it that is I I kid
you not oh also scams also people
sitting there finding some random
influencer be like he guys do you want
to see if your cross likes your photos
just type in the random name into this
website and uh you know we you'll be
would have instantly find him of course
we debunk that scam it's obviously a
scam so um I can't believe I'm saying
this but Tik Tok is better than snap
whees and yes Tik Tok is a Gom scrolly
mware spy app but at least it's a good
Chom marware scrolly app meta maybe I
was thinking about them too but they
they already have Instagram reals
Instagram reals are decent I mean sure
they're like half racist but they're
half racist and
funny okay um I don't know about Tik Tok
because I'm obviously I'm not on it but
also meta I mean they're doing pretty
well they have ai they have WhatsApp
they have Instagram they have Facebook
um I don't know if they want to build
something else I was thinking maybe
YouTube okay and they could spin out
just rename Tik Tok and call it shorts
spin the shorts out of the normal
YouTube app and people people like them
apparently um but you know the FTC might
say nope that's Monopoly we can't have
that and of course Google you know
they're in court proceedings they're
trying to break up Chrome so I don't
think you know that would be a good
thing unless of course you know they
switch everything up and they stopped
the stupid doj from trying to break up
Chrome from Google like that's
absolutely ridiculous all right
um I was thinking that the number one
people were saying Oracle this was
happening back in 2022 uh 2020 as well
not 2022 but people saying Oracle can
buy Tik Tok I don't think that Oracle
the company behind VMware is going to
want a app meant for 13 to 18y old
children I'm I'm just saying I'm
probably like the only few children that
actually use vmw all right um I was
thinking the number one would be
Microsoft Microsoft loves loves loves
Tik Tok I mean they love it okay and yes
I know Tik Tock is one of the number one
free apps on the Apple App Store and of
course you know all the people who are
celebrating right now waving the
American flag and you know C you're like
yes let's go um um you know are all 13
and 18 also you know they can't vote and
you know they're they're all you know
popular with iPhones so maybe Apple buy
I don't see Apple buying them Google
does need a social media platform though
but I think Microsoft is the number one
Microsoft is the number one
because they love Tik Tok I mean they
have it pre-installed I think it might
even be on here t i t no it's not here
yet any I I probably deleted it because
it's useless anyway Microsoft loves Tik
to they have them pre-installed on their
Windows 11 PCS they and 10 PCS or at
least they have advertising deals with
them Microsoft needs a video um
distribution thing um they uh they they
have the money they have the money like
they're able to fund chat TPT they need
video right they want to compete exactly
they want to compete with uh what's
their name Google in YouTube right they
have their own search engine they have
their own AI powered by chat GPT the
only thing they don't have is video and
they'll get vertical video good vertical
video um I'm not saying Tik Tok is good
but I'm saying like the the servers and
the back end and everything they'll get
they'll get the video stuff they'll have
all the and then they can Mass put it on
um millions and millions of PCS
worldwide um you know just like bite
dance did with I think it was called
musically back in 2018 or 2016 I didn't
even have a phone back then so I don't
remember um but like one night kids woke
up musically they did their little dance
things and then the next day they woke
up and they were on t to and it was just
a mass update now boom they're on
millions of iPhones worldwide well
Microsoft could do the same thing of
course Microsoft developers can then
make Tik Tok well safe you know it' be
an American company and then you can
have instead of just vertical video then
you can have horizontal video you can
prior prioritize those results in being
and maybe get some ads on Google and
boom Tik Tok is still number one
application and you have a awesome
YouTube competitor as well long as they
like take out the junk right so I think
Microsoft might be number one Google
number two if they because they have the
money open AI can't afford anything
they're broke snap I would really like
Snap to buy it because their RS are
trash in fact let's let's uh let's look
at snap's reals right now okay and snap
is the only reason I have that is an
important thing to SS ltw because um of
a special operation back in
uh May right which you will be reading
about speaking of ssw there is a new um
article out and we're getting the book
promoted also speaking of I need to find
lots of teens teens all over the place
on social media right that aren't like
huge super huge accounts not like
influencer influencers but people that
would actually get back to me who I can
send a book out to and talk to anyone
have any ideas because no one no one
really knows how to find people
um on say Instagram or I guess Tik Tok
which I will make one if Microsoft buys
it all right let's let's go in and check
with the snap RS for
now got to put in the password come on
SEC
for there we go all right so let's let's
check in with the snap Wheels let's go
to Snap Chat and I'm going to show you
how bad this is now Snapchat isn't that
probably because they have uh those
stupid spectacle lenses they I I don't
even know how to make money like it's a
chat
app all anyway let's go through the
wheels I'm going to I'm going to
uh I'm going to all right mute it and
I'm just going to read through here okay
so it's this person reading tweets
number one number two it's of course the
random street interviewer the random
street interviewer people here we
go again I never see these Street
interviewers ever walking on the street
with these random women they somehow
find on the street and he asked them
questions and they they just sit around
and they say dumb stuff because
apparently the dumbest people just kind
of hang out on streets that I don't know
about all right then we have a Timber
red
um a video recording of a news clip from
like
uh
uh like a long time ago and then we have
one of those phony text videos which is
okay interesting we have some
gameplay with a meme on top I'm not
something oh and then they have brain
rot Christmas car I mean it is terrible
another
timad like the Reales here are trash
like absolute trash no one watches these
garbage garbage okay so I would really
like Snap to buy something and I don't
know fix it um but I don't think they
can afford it because I think snap in De
they have those stupid snap spectacles
all right so yeah Tik Tok safe for now
but I think Microsoft may buy it um they
certainly have the money they have the
want they have the need maybe Samsung
but Samsung's not an American company so
no it has to be an American company so
guys what do you think what American
companies will buy Tik Tock and save the
teenage girls hopes and dreams who now
have AOW patriotism and respect for
someone that they can't vote for ever
because they're 14 and they can't vote
all right
on to modesty gate modesty uh what was
it modesty War 3 that's what we called
it well we have this article over from
uh
CC
um there we go let me get the link up
Isabel Maria
Dela she absolutely destroyed the uh
comment I I I call I called it my new
favorite television show over on X and
it is it is it is a great show it it is
a great show honestly one of the
greatest shows of Our
Generation even even better than boy me
world for fact anyway uh here is what we
hope you guys can see this on the screen
my new favorite TV show when I add so
people she wore this dress in good grief
this dress caused a war in the comments
like never seen before I mean you I mean
well actually has been seen before in
October and with calendar gate and with
uh the gate and but anyway it was a war
like never seen before because it ended
it ended quickly so here here's the
picture right and um December 24th is
the day it ended it was
over
over in h Minnesota anyway like these
people were criticizing her and
commenting her and she went full on
snipe attack and she went out and took
out the the the head of the the salance
I mean she went out and she had nope we
we're taking these people out piece by
piece picked them off one by won and her
ex engagement grew and revenue came
streaming in anyway here's the plot
leaked to to the new television show
this is good editing don't you think cut
up from the Samsung clip F also we have
to talk about this biggest downgrade of
all time it's it's so sad um I I'll find
you the picture all right a new TV show
script exclusive X called as Isabella
Maria deuca takes down the haters leak
today Isabella re to be revealed to be
an ex genius post a picture um predicted
to generate conf uh cont controversy at
the isab Maria Del spiden C moners uing
hate comments and see sniped back at the
major attackers creating warfront on
both sides and snap snapped back and
one oh you can't even see this on the
screen anyway Isabella she won she
destroyed the comment to Courtney nail
jumping in as well well as
um what's your name the redheaded girl
yeah so um there was a war over and
ended quickly because she didn't s sit
there and cry P or anything she just
took them um and she posted a picture
people came in they commented of course
you know we came to a defend and then as
always and then you know she took them
out behind the Woodshed driving and C
crying uh all the way back as they go
and it was beautiful to watch over but
unfortunately because he did such a
great job I mean absolutely destroying
those comment and um shutting them up I
mean
we didn't get to watch it for long you
know they're on to something new blaming
Bo me world for everything apparently um
as the subreddit P it laying the foot of
America's problems at Cory's Treehouse
which
is hilarious so speaking of the show I
was listening to their podcast it's
called pod me world and I first have to
say anything is a character in the show
named and I'm kidding you not tapanga
which I'm sorry but if your name is
Tanga you don't get an opinion on
anything that's a terrible
name it's horrible okay apparently it's
named after some tree in California or
something which if you're naming your
child after trees in California or
something like
that well I
mean
it's no that's sad all
right um oh wow actual message from an
actual person that actually wants to
message me wow this is this is this is
this is something nope it's met as AI
never mind let's uh forget let let's
forget we actually said that on stream
[Music]
anyway apparently it the plot of the
show which is apparently so loved and
reviewed by
most except for
effect is um date date kiss date date
dat date date date which leads me to ask
do people actually like kissing like
you're just sitting there licking
someone and transmitting Co also that
game that they were showing I forgot um
what's it called seven minutes of Heaven
seems like torture and that sounds like
you're just going to you're getting set
up for failure and they'll probably
stuff into a closet and then you get
tortured and then National Security will
fall all around the school so
sad all right anyway back to our Tech
topic of the week we had to take a
um take a something because
a break here something grock is trash
did we go over that oh yeah we went over
that on stream last week but then we um
reviewed it we have to talk about this
application Merry Christmas this is a
Christmas present for me to everyone do
not download this application it's a QR
code scanning application you may ask
which one none none of them do not
download QR code scanning applications
because you have them built right into
your phone okay your QR code scanning
application is built right into your
phone um and if you download these
applications like this you either have
either a one bad thing which can be just
you're wasting space because you don't
need it and B it's either ad or malware
it needs all these kind of things like
microphone camera access of course but
then location and things that it just
doesn't need it do a bad application to
download you don't need them to built
into your phone so if you have a QR code
scanning application and I've seen
someone use it they pick out their phone
and yes it was one of the lower end
phones
but it's not it's not good but it's not
that it's not like super terrible bad
like it was one of the lower end phones
but doesn't matter they had the phone
you hit it here if it takes time to scan
I think you actually saw a red line go
over it and go and then it would load
and then you have to take the picture
and of course the haptics are bad and
then you get your QR code scanner which
you have a QR code scanner built right
into your phone Samsung at least um
apple as well um and if you don't have
Samsung or Apple you have Google um the
Google application you have Google Lens
you take it you put out your phone you
you take out Google Lens so I'm going to
show this on the screen I'm going to BL
it so you don't see anything in the room
there we go um and you just click that
and then you can scan it and if you have
a QR code let just make a QR code of
this uh
website I'm going
to
oops there you go let's make a QR code
of
this come on make a QR code I miss when
they had the just the easy D button oh
is this it no that's tab
grouping oh I'll make a c code over on
here so you guys don't have to see it
let's see me see if I can find the
share there we go just have to type
in e
all right I'm back I'm back guys um
apparently um trying to share the QR
code uh just it didn't want to do that
today so the browser crashed anyway you
can scan your QR code um
and you will be able to get on the
screen so if you have your camera
application on Samsung or Apple devices
you can use that or use Google L on any
other any other device you don't need a
QR code scanning application right let's
get into the phones of the Year from mkb
we did this from Mr who's the boss a few
weeks ago um also we have to talk about
our new SS ltw entry um remember the
series is following um what happened in
real life the book uh is following you
know what would happen if Ean had more
time and more students to um run in the
presidential election all right so here
is Mr who MKBHD
and I'm going to be try to try to be
positive today because yes it is hard
finding um hacking tutorials apparently
and you guys know that there was a there
was a big problem trying to find haing
hacking tutorials online like if you try
to find in how to hack this or how to
hack that you're gon G to find whole
bunch of antivirus websites and um
things that say oh yes this could happen
or this may may not happen um
but you don't really find the tutorials
you don't really find the softwares and
people are saying oh well it's it's
really easy to hack into a computer if
someone gets into your network but no
one's really showed me how now of course
you know if you download some stupid
program yes but not saying like if
you're on someone's Wi-Fi network they
can hack into other than just like
stealing your browsing data and cookies
which has largely been mitigated by
https but I mean I'm talking about like
being able to infect the computer I even
have Windows 11 Pro on here so you
should be able to um command prompt to
another computer uh message I want to
see what it's what's that called CMV
prompt um message I think it's called
like Nets in but they changed it U yes
it's called message so let me let's see
if this thing works like it's it's just
really sad trying to find you know new
uses for technology of course like I say
we talk about this all the time with the
browser and and brow like the browsers
and stuff like that but it's also really
hard to find like new hacking tutorials
and I know you guys try to gatekeep some
of that stuff but like it's getting kind
of boring and lonely out here just
sitting around here arguing with people
you know on internet of course me being
right and them being wrong they don't
they don't really understand the and
grasp my intelligence
nonetheless um yes here we go W uh this
really sad downgrade from Isabella I
mean if you want to cancel Isabella can
cancel her for
this cancel her for this don't cancel
for anything else cancel her for this
and then we'll get to MKBHD so anyway
here is a
picture from Instagram
no look at the look at the downgrade so
um this is new it's the iPhone 16 all
right and then she looks like she has
the iPhone 13 uh Pro I think is there a
hole in the phone that might she
downgraded look you have three cameras
and light on and you switched over to
just uh wide angle wide angle cameras
this is
terrible this is
terrible no get a pro get a pro so if
you if you guys want to have a gate let
this be the lesson don't downgrade your
phone oh we already have a we already
have a chat coming in all right what's
the chat say Merry Christmas David and
what do you think about the terrible
terrible downgrade I mean poor poor
girls getting canceled for everything
that you know doesn't matter but I mean
if you guys want to cancel her cancel
her for for that I mean this that's
totally disrespectful to the entire Tech
Community anyway to MKBHD and I
guarantee you her phone will not be one
of the phones of the you well it wasn't
on
uh it wasn't on the other channel oh I
think it will be because it's in the
thumbnail so maybe she she did get one
of the phones to the year so so she
didn't she didn't pick like an iPhone 14
and then kind of like
downgrade hope oh it's probably maybe
maybe she
uh she still s got a pro I'm just gonna
say like she needs she needs to zoom
photos she need to light R you know for
all the light R things that she does um
you know I'm sure she's a great Light
Art user always use a light art scanner
um that's what I always say um anyway um
I'm produc s is taking 3D maps of the
room um of her room right and we we can
have her with inferior technology this
is this is this is not good not good at
all um I'm sure she's listening right
now instead of doing something more
important and productive anyway here is
the uh smartphone Awards of 2024 and if
she is listening send the comment
please and then I'll make it my uh
Banner all right so here's the
smartphone reward 2024 I'm going to tell
you smartphones what I don't like of
course you know I haven't been able to
use them because I don't have that kind
of money which if you guys want to send
in that kind of money thank
you is an audience live audience also
why is this in 220p but I guess we're
going to have to deal with it 360p okay
got a suit and a hoodie all right
welcome he's he's been on the tie he's
been on the tie to the smartphone Awards
2024 every year dozens the best big
phone let some awards so the first
category best big phone so the idea
behind this category was to sort of
separate smaller phones and then the
bigger phones and then reward the
absolute best big phones but the of
course you
know uh obviously the iPhone 6 she had
is not going to be do but you know 16
Pro Max it might be one of the best big
phones uh s24 Ultra of course one of the
best big phones um you know Vivo x 200
which has been getting lots of press
lots of you know videos um about I've
been hearing much about is the best
phone phone of the M the boss um that
also has a big screen so you know let's
see what mkbc has to say about what the
best big phone is thing about phones
these days is they're all kind of big
now like phones are just getting bigger
so I'm going to try to reward the
absolute biggest ones and the ones that
make the most use the ones that W fold
on cuz there's a special category just
for the
folds having a little bit of extra space
so like here's an example the Rog phone
9 this came out late in the calendar
year but because it's a gaming phone
they sort of Target all the things that
make it good at gaming and they also
have but look at those cameras do uh
looks like it's only two maybe three I
make it a great regular phone huge 6.8
in screen also huge speakers also huge
battery
it's great for regular phones it even
has a headphone jack but it's not
perfect that's great would you guys have
to have headphone jack or micro SD quad
slot I do like that it has those
features like big good speakers speakers
are important but I like can see it
compared to just a regular ear piece and
speaker combo of a big phone like s24
Ultra iPhone um because you know the
bigger the phone the more noise you can
make perfect but one got really really
close this year and that's the Vivo X200
Pro again a phone to come out late in
the calendar year but they basically did
everything looks like that things would
have a attachment for it I know xiaomi
had an attachment for camera lens from
somebody phone it was a experimental
thing that
$43,000 which is an insane amount of
money to pay for a phone that's now with
this phone you can see the huge camera
bump there's some incredible camera
Hardware in here another huge screen but
one phone did outdo it there was one big
phone that kind of nailed everything
about being a big phone okay and that's
the winner which is the Samsung Galaxy
s24 Ultra Samsung got this formul this
is a good phone I like the spin though
it is broken off and all together um it
does use its screen real estate
effectively you know I'm able to swipe
down and um you know split screen stuff
have three apps running at the same time
have Edge panels so we have to talk
about the edge panels when you're i7
they are missing the edge uh tools like
the level and the uh Compass which I
miss and hopefully Samsung brings that
back uh at least allows me to redownload
them that's really bad really it's not a
good thing all
right but the battery life is not as
good as I would like it to
be to a science they have made a really
good use of space in the Ultra Series of
phones for years now really nice screen
probably one of the best in any
smartphone also with this really good
anti-reflective coating that kind of
went under the radar but is really good
on this phone really good cameras on the
back without protruding too much it also
has a huge battery which of course I
don't notice because of my case while
still having a stylus down there there's
just a lot going on in this phone and
all the software to back it up plus it
recently started getting this one ui7
beta which jumps a which is important I
do like getting updates also Motorola
where the flagships uh they should they
is advertising on Android 15 it's
getting software updates there just a
lot of good things going on with this
phone it's skewed with these Awards
sometimes to be the phones that came out
later in the year this came out in
January still deserves the award so then
next category best small phone this is
okay so um you know I think it's about
this phone the iPhone 16 is considered
the small phone um let's show the image
again it's the pink phone here um I
think it's like 6.1 inches and oh back
to the awards this is kind of a sad one
actually this year because while like
you've seen lots of phones have been
getting big bigger and bigger the small
phones usually would pull up the rear
there'd be a couple small phones that
sort of float around and deliver that
special experience for people who want a
flagship but that's not huge the mini
and the Zen Asus did not make their Zen
phone this year so no no Zen
phones phones they made it but not the
small version of world uh but those are
all dead now so then what's left what
could be the best small phone among all
the stuff that we saw
come out this year here think about this
the Samsung Galaxy s24 came out earlier
this year right it's not that big of a
phone it's a 6.2 inch display it's the
smallest flag yeah and bezels you know
small ship that they made 6.2 inch
screen is bigger than the phone that won
the best big phone 10 years ago which
was the 5.7 in Galaxy Note 4 so that
just shows you how crazy it's gotten you
know there's the Vivo X200 mini also
came out that was still over 6 in really
good phone for that size and I also
considered the flipping phones every
year they're they're appealing as small
phones but then you open them up and
they're huge again yeah they're all 6.7
in which makes sense because you need
the cover
display ultimately what I settled on was
the iPhone 16 best small phone of 2024
so the iPhone 16 is rocking a 6.1 inch
display note that it's the same body
size as the iPhone 16 Pro but with a
slightly smaller screen but I really
like the way that Apple stepped up the
base yeah and her phone did win the
award of course this is the blue one not
the pink one but it's the same phone um
I'm not really sure if I'm a fan of this
phone of course I'm not a fan of Apple
but um it is popular I mean we have
people literally switching over from the
uh iPhone iPhone 13 to
the uh Pro to the iPhone uh
16 phones this year they have really
good cameras really good battery life
Flagship chip performance when it just
seems like the phone it's going to be
popular like the phone I say it's in
sucession with all the iPhones years of
software updates more RAM than the base
phones I've ever had and yeah I could
have given this to the 16 Pro because of
how mad I am personally about the lack
of higher fresh rate but everything else
about the base iPhone feel and also you
know the zoom telephoto camera I mean
Apple cannot keep getting away with this
apple can't get away with selling a
phone for the same price as the s24 or
the s24 plus and selling it without a
zoom camera without 120 or even 90 H
refresh rate or without anything you
know of that of that
nature feels as close to the flagship as
it's ever been and I even prefer things
like the matte rails and the real
variety of colors they've just done a
really good job with the iPhone 16 so in
this world of so many phones being so
gigantic and trying to pack as much as
possible into a huge phone and being a
two-handed phone shout out to the couple
of one-handed phones I can use this
pretty onehanded even with the case on
it so then that brings us to our next
category of the
night big news from momes I'm switching
iPhone 16 pro at T-Mobile it's built for
Apple intelligence that's like peanut
butter on jelly on gold get four iPhone
16 Pro on us plus four lines for 25
bucks what a deal y'all giving it away
too fast t-m slow
down best camera so things are always
interesting in the camera space for a
couple of reasons number one obviously
the hardware just keeps getting better
and better year after year better
Periscope cameras bigger sensors all the
Optics improve but
also also you know we finally got you
know some new buttons some new hardware
camera control button on the iPhone this
year especially we've just seen a ton of
AI stuff everyone is expected to have
some AI especially in their cameras
whether it's AI scene recognition or AI
portrait mode that's just a Google n
with a few extra steps it's just
hilarious or AI background object
removal whatever it is there's got to be
AI in just about every camera so in that
way I I can definitely say that my
criteria for best camera has moved
around a bit and this feels like one of
the most competitive years ever for
cameras you know the pixel we didn't do
the blind camera test this year but I
suspect it would have done which you
know that's that takes a lot of work
that to scrub the exit
data on really well again they still
have that look to them and the Galaxy
s24 Ultra is just consistently so good
at photos and videos for Android phones
every year but one could be better night
shots you know there's still a bit of
some Shadow lag but yep it is a good
camera system one really stood out it
can record now at ak30 and 8K 24 frames
per second this year and again it came
out late during the calendar year but
the vi X200 Pro man if you haven't heard
about this phone this has got some
serious camera hardware and the reason
it stood out to me is because it feels
like it comes the closest to an actual
real camera shooting experience I mean
look at the lens and I know it's fake um
like you know that's not all One camera
they just do that for to make it look
impressive and also to help prevent
camera wble but still it does have big
cin on it which means it can get a lot
more light and results out of anything
on this table so Hardware Wise It's
already high-end it's got a really big
50 megapix main sensor it also has a
large 50 megapixel ultrawide and it has
a 200 megapixel sensor behind that
Periscope zoom lens as well the shots
that come from it have this great
natural depth of field as well the
camera app is quick and full of options
and the super high resolution on that
telephoto lens means that it can go from
the 3.7x optical way way in and still
maintain sharpness even without doing
the s24 ultra dual telephoto thing plus
I had a lot of fun playing with the
portrait lens looks built in which can
shape and stylize the bokeh in a way
that's really convincing in even if I
wish the
um you know Samsung had more interesting
um features like this I mean they do
have some things like the little glitch
um thing that I really like on s20 2
plus I tested it out they I you know I
got it um on someone when I got back to
school back in 2022
um you know there the black and white
stuff but I mean maybe just add some
more fun to the camera application I
know for some reason teenagers like
recording
stuff on Snapchat
just and then putting stuff over it
which is you
knows subject cutouts aren't perfect but
it didn't win my award this year look
I'm just as tired of it as you guys are
but if you had to take just one
smartphone from this table from this
year to take all of your photos and
videos The Choice is still the iPhone 16
Pro the streak continues M come on
pick pick this one please and yeah I
hate them winning every year just as
much as the next person but look ask
anyone shoots and relies on videos and
photos from their smartphone regularly
what they would use and the answer just
keeps coming back iPhone 16 Pro
obviously it's easy to shoot with it's
simple and it's reliable over and over
again it produces that similar look and
they added a lot of specific features
this year to dialing in that look so you
have all these new manual controls you
have all these formats that you can
shoot in
yeah yeah you do have all these like
settings I do like in the cam
application but when you have to go into
the like these settings
too it's it's terrible actually the
video is consistently unparalleled from
the 4K 30 and the autofocus to the super
stabilized video to the super slow-mo
video I I honestly want another
smartphone to come along and knock it
off its post and I think we're closer
than ever to that but for right now
iPhone is still the truth in the camera
Department next category
value every year this is the most
interesting and competitive category
because there are so many options that
come out in the value budget space I
remember when the pixel 3A and 7A were
popular not at the same time of course
but the pixel they were so
great even some that are not on this
table in front of me uh that are super
competitive and all have different
things that they prioritize and at
different price points and that's always
the question about value isn't it what
what price Point are we going to have
that qualifies it as a as a value phone
is it should just be anything under 500
bucks or anything under 400 maybe that
makes more sense or maybe it should just
be anything that just has the absolute
max value for the price that you can
what do you think how it value phones be
categories i' say value phones are being
anything that you can find say on the
checkout counter of Best Buy some of the
first phones you see in TMobile like
some of the things that you call like
budget phones and maybe even some
mid-range some of the the top phones
over not not including iPhones but the
top phones off on Amazon so this would
be stuff like a the
a15 the um you know
A35 um isn't the a16 coming out too so
when that comes out uh the Su of the
Moto phones like phones like that they
should get some more
attention shoving a phone even if it is
a
flagship and that's actually what I'm
doing the fact is it's just harder
though for a more expensive phone to
actually deliver on on much more value
the CL exactly and the reason for that
is we don't have as many good
applications um Coming anymore and I say
this every week but we need new
applications like I was talking about
with the hacking thing like I was
talking about with with the websites and
computers and software it's just it's
just
not there
anymore in
sadic law of diminishing returns how can
an $800 phone give you twice as much
value as a $400 phone it just can't so
you know redmi every year has a ton of
really competitive options also it seems
like Poco is always churning out at
every single price point they possibly
can but what stood out to me this year I
do want to give a shout out to the pixel
8A it came out at 500 bucks and has a
really good camera system in this price
range I probably get that my best value
phone um you know it does get the Gemini
AI you do get the updates um it's
premium looking at the bezels are a bit
the bezels are fine but you know some
people may not like that but it did kind
of feel like it was clashing a little
bit with the pixel 8 but also the cmf
phone one came out this year and it's a
nice phone except for the you know whole
exploding in people's pockets and
killing them things that but yeah and
this was a $200 phone that delivered a
lot of value in a bunch of ways but also
in just fun and modularity and
accessibilities and and this unique
design and you don't see a lot of you
don't see any really other I guess one
other Orange phone on this desk but this
is a really interesting pH to come out
you want your phone to be bright orange
I'm trying to call 911 and then people
like people and you're like under attack
or something and people see you pull out
this giant flaming Beacon it was
actually easy to recommend so 200 bucks
it gets a shout out for sure but my
winner for best value for
2024 that's going to go to the nothing
phone 2A so this phone that's
interesting I don't really like nothing
you know software skin that much but it
is an interesting
phone the cameras I think they're decent
and um I haven't really seen here in the
United States so can it come here
launched at $350 it gave you a big
bright 120 HZ screen with uniform bezels
all the way around that's rare which is
which is nice of course I don't really
care that much about bezels I mean look
at the applications here these are the
fun applications the applications he
uses most what the heck is superum let's
see superum
oh it's an email app oh how
much o o that's a lot of money for email
$300 a year maybe they'll give it to me
for free
maybe all right let's see Spotify okay
notion again just a note taking
application Instagram Tesla all of these
basically web apps except for you know
the core phone application
check Flagship size 5,000 milliamp
battery with which is good of course
because of the lower performing chips
means I will suck less power so it
probably has better battery life than S4
which has terrible terrible battery life
at least on my
end 45 wat charging check a serviceable
50 megapixel main Camera Plus an ultra
wide if you need it check under display
fingerprint reader you know it didn't
Benchmark super high but their
performance has always been really
smooth they do a great job optimizing
their software and then of course the
glyphs on the back however you feel
about those this was just one of those
phones that costs way less than all the
other flagships here but as you use it
at least as I used it it consistently
feels as smooth as and as well thought
out as any other Flagship especially
with the smoothness of the software so a
big shout out to them for that it keeps
getting software updates I hope it gets
way more nothing phone 2A impressive
value 2024 there's a check so
then what you would you buy so of course
I have this 24 Ultra so I'd keep it I I
probably get the a wouldn't get the
iPhone um so yeah three for
four actually I we can't be a specialist
of every
single maybe I give it to a friend
but but you give me the pro right I'll
give you the pro category best battery
there's been a lot more phone I really
like the phone in this category I mean
it is it's insane was pushing the
battery limits this year and you know
this award is is is just for battery
experience overall which includes
battery life so I can't help but notice
when there's way more 5,000 5500 6,000
mamp batteries in these big flagships
than I've seen in a long time but it's
not purely just the biggest battery
capacity that's going to win you my
award for this I'm not just going to
give this to the 28,000 milliamp hour
Energizer phone that does exist every
year it's crazy it's just peace of mind
right long battery life is one thing
yeah of course you wouldn't want a phone
that has like that looks like this I
mean I would but most people wouldn't I
mean obious I buy the case I keep it on
most of the time lots of good battery
maintenance features convenient fast
charging is another thing like the big
iPhones come out every year and they
have really good battery life but they
just charge too slow so the Samsung
Galaxy s24 Ultra comes out this year has
a 5,000 milliamp hour battery with room
for the stylus as well it also has 45
wat Peak charging and and wireless
charging and it just seemed to last
forever like this is a phone you could
use all day easily I don't know what
he's talking about I mean this phone be
dead by three I use from eight it would
be dead by three with this big bright
screen but that wasn't enough that
wasn't enough there was almost a
subcategory of what I would consider
like Mega flagships that came out this
year that sort of took things to the
next level Oppo Find X8 Pro again a late
addition to the calendar
5,900 M almost 6,000 Milli batteries of
course you know optimization Chinese
software I'm not really sure how well it
does also you know you have to kill it
training software does like to kill lots
of things so you miss notifications so
again if you try to optimize it the
American way which is getting your
notifications on time so see we're
better we're just better you know we
like to have notifications on time in
this country anyway if you opiz it that
way I'm not sure how well the battery
compared to his s24 Ultra mine is
terrible I think it's just because the
uh smart switch from the terrible s22
plus transferred over to the terrible
battery
life battery and also 80 watts of peak
charging so this can go 0 to 100 in a
little under an hour it also could do 50
wat wireless charging with the right air
vuk charging pad it's ridiculous still
wasn't enough the Vivo X200 Pro also
came out this year had a 6,000 mAh
battery and they're good same thing joft
I'm not sure about that 90 watt charging
do you know how insane that would be
great good that's two times faster than
s24 Ultra with 45 watt charging about
four times faster than the regular most
phones 25 watt charging which would be
100 um and I think does have wir dis
charging I think so which is important
to me you know you can put it in your
car you can put it I don't well you I
don't drive but if I did you could put
it in your car 90 watt charging still
wasn't enough because there is one phone
that crossed my desk this year again
pretty late that had might be nice to
have so many phones that you can pick
and choose which one you want to review
and you still get to keep them things
that I hadn't really seen much at all
during the calendar year which was the
new Snapdragon 8 Elite Chip and A 7,000
milliamp battery 7,000 that's 2 more
than the s24 ultra so that would
basically be this battery case here just
by itself is 10,000 milliamp hour so
about that size and this battery taste
here they sent the wrong one it's for
s24 Ultra r three Ultra so that's why it
didn't fit is 20 is 5,000 mamp hours so
this right here it has more battery
charging than a full charge up for the
s34
ultra so it could probably last at least
a day and a half maybe longer with
optimization that's your winner which is
the red look at that phone look how thin
it is no it's not water resistant but
look the cameras not you know as good
but look it's flat and when you 10 Pro
this is a gaming phone and it is
entirely designed around gaming with
things like an exposed active fan that
sacrifices water resistance but still
you have a fan and 2,000 M hours more
than s24 Ultra
insane for spinning up and keeping it
cool when it's gaming and charging but
the Snapdragon 8 Elite ship has been
like a superpower in the couple of
phones that it started to show up in
late this year there's a couple other
phones that have it but it has been
dramatically more efficient than the
previous generation which we love seeing
so it has that chip maybe leave a thumbs
up if you want to see a video just about
the Snapdragon 8 Elite but then I'd like
to know what some of the AI projects
they working on can
do it also has a 7,50 mAh
battery insane so just that combo alone
makes this a 2-day phone comfortably at
144 HZ which is sick you could also turn
it down to 60 HZ and do even better than
that if you want and when you do have to
charge it up it'll go 0 to 100 in half
an hour or so cuz it charges at 100
watts of peak charging so it's just got
a lot going for it it also has all the
battery maintenance features you can cap
it at 80% charging if you want it's also
got bypass charging to avoid thermal
damage there's just a lot in the battery
Department red magic 10 Pro battery
champ 2024 so our next category is the
best design if you hang out in the
YouTube comments section long enough
you'll read things like smartphones are
just kind of boring these days like
they're I've been reading stuff like
that since like 2015 all the same as
last year have we reached Peak
smartphone is nothing different
anymore and if you agree with that you
kind of have to ignore some of the most
interesting stuff happening around the
edges some of the most Innovative and
fascinating design choices that we've
seen in a long time worth honoring a
little bit in 2024 the cmf phone 1 that
I talked about earlier I wonder if this
is a reference to anything let's see
this is one of those great examples a
super budget phone that tries to Stand
Out by doing something a little bit
different design like a fun design being
the reason you buy this $200 budget
phone over others I actually think from
its Big Brother company the nothing
phone 2A did a lot of similar things
yeah but design isn't that good I mean
you can easily get that confused if the
lights off with the Google pixel 8A I
mean if you're not really a tech expert
you don't really remember the camera's
look the same you flip it over a little
bit boom iPhone uh 16 it's uh the glyph
design on the back the transparent stuff
they had some special editions they
thought a lot about design in this phone
and connected it to the software which I
think is really cool but when I'm giving
a design award I also I I don't want to
give it to anything that had a critical
flaw like I want to give it to someone
that just definitely didn't do anything
wrong like
s24 or pixel
9 but that would be boring big news from
my homes I'm switching iPhone 16 pro at
Team Mobile it's built for Apple
intelligence that's like peanut butter
on jelly on gold get four iPhone 16 Pro
on us plus four lines for 25 bucks what
a deal y'all giving it away too fast TM
slow
down so my design Award winner for
2024 is the Huawei mate XT AK oh I mean
yeah you you did do something wrong you
spied on the United States including
your stupid toaster shout me a the
trifold look you guys have seen the
video on this phone there were some
rumors now about it maybe not being
super durable honestly probably true I
mean no duh like who who would have
thought that a phone that went unfold is
thinner than my phone but like two
times would crack in half with two
inches I mean wow there was articles
about maybe some bad press being covered
up because it's Huawei and this phone's
coming straight out of China and they
want to kind of cover that probably true
but the fact that a real smartphone
company had the audacity to not just
build a Do anything else to do if you
think about it like they can't make any
good chips they can't
uh you know they they can't really use
Android which they still do they try to
pass it off to their own operating
system they I mean might as well just
use the money they have and make
interesting projects bunch of these but
build a lot of them and ship them all
and actually build features around them
that actually works I actually remember
reading those articles about you know
the the Spy shots of the CEO of Huawei
using this unique triple folding thing
on a plane and I remember thinking okay
yeah but that's he knows he's being
photographed he's that's not a real
phone they did not only did they
actually do it but this is a crazy
impressive phone it's super thin it has
the hinges it has the battery
distributed through everything it's got
the cameras on the back they've got
software features that work with both
two and three panels there's just so
much going for it I can't not I can't
not give this the award very deserving
of the design award for 2024 so then
next category conveniently best foldable
so we added will not be winning this new
category last year just because it it
was becoming more clear than ever that
foldables were first of all more
plentiful than ever before there's more
options than ever before and it feels
like they're here to stay at least for a
while so let's reward the good ones and
you know at the beginning of the whole
foldables category it was kind of all
Samsung like they had that early lead
because they dove in so early course the
zold 2 was so good so good and you know
they still make the zold 6 and it's a
solid phone but I I wouldn't say they're
holding the torch anymore I would
actually say this phone right here this
is the honor magic V3 and that's a good
I've heard about it of course they split
it off from the payment company Huawei
so they can you can buy it here in the
state kind of the mantle right now for
best overall foldable Hardware there's
so much good about this Hardware I mean
it's extremely thin it feels Flagship
from the lack of a crease inside to how
much battery and how much camera they
fit in this phone really really sturdy
hinge this a great a nice sound really
solid piece there's also the triple fold
you know that's a crazy design as we
already know but I'm giving the award
for best foldable of
2024 to the pixel 9 Pro fold I really
like what Google did with the design
they did have a really big upgrade it
goow up over last year's fold and the
hardware and the software of the second
ever folding pixel you they did change a
lot and it is still very usable while
closed but they trimmed up all the
dimensions they flattened the sides they
improved the hinge the cameras are all
better and it feels Zoom look at the
zoom look at the zoom right there among
the world of folding Android phones that
we have right now like the most polished
at least there's a lot of good Android
stuff going on to take advantage of the
folding screen like if camera app it
looks so bad it looks so bad like stock
Android like those kind of like they
didn't really do much on it like
Motorola sometimes pixel does not look
that good
also I was at the Costco store yesterday
and I was in the tech section and I was
trying to use the Mac right and they had
the Mac Magic Mouse there they had it
locked down so badly I couldn't even use
it no one wants to steal your Magic
Mouse
uh no one wants to steal your magic
mouse No
One Like Magic m is a ter forc me to use
a folding phone right now as much as I
would want the hardware of the honor I
would pick the pixel fold and I I came
close to dailying this phone for quite a
while in this year really big fan of
this phone and if you've got to have a
flip because the flipping thing is
different from the folding thing I would
still say Samsung carries a torch there
as well but modet is also carrying up
the
rear so little shout out to the Z flip 6
no trophy for you sorry but shout out to
the pixel 9 Pro fold so next category
one that's been here again for all 10 of
these is the most improved award so most
improved year-over-year my first thought
when putting this category together was
this might be the hardest one to give
out this year like what really stood out
as the biggest Delta the biggest change
a lot of times it's one that actually
went wrong the previous year and sort of
rided the ship or maybe took a big leap
in something that was bad the previous
year but what what really had the
biggest change from its previous year I
mean you have the Oppo Find X8 Pro which
okay much brighter screen this year
they've got improved cameras this new
back is really nice and also it's got
the new chipset and the new software and
it's a little more squared up that's
nice I don't know if it's going to win
most improved though and actually for
the first time in a while the base
iPhones were in consideration for this
one that makes sense because I you know
better chips new design the iPhone 16
this generation did the most relative to
the previous bass iPhone to to get it
close to the pros that we've ever seen
and that's good for us like more RAM
great chipset improved cameras and the
new layout and obviously it has the
camera control button that the pros have
but it also isn't that much better I
think it's pretty clear though the most
improved smartphone over last year's
version obviously Google pixel book yeah
that is definitely the pixel9 pro fold
the foldable pixel was something we'd
wanted for a long time and the first
pixel fold last year was a cool idea
right like we all wanted to see it and
Google finally delivered it but if we're
being honest with ourselves it didn't
really excel in any way with the
hardware especially like it was cool
seeing Android could improve and handle
the bigger screen on the inside but I
mean that thing had some pretty thick
bezels in there it didn't even fold flat
I'm going to say that again it didn't
even fold flat so the second generation
pixel fold here represents a glow up in
every single way like every square
millimeter of this got better I think a
lot of us were expecting to see a
generation OnePlus foldable but they
just didn't make it but this is kind of
the closest I I wonder if maybe there'll
be another one I think we could see to
that much better cameras much better
thinner hinge the whole thing is
skinnier the bezels on the inside are
much better it folds flat there's less
crease the outside screen is better it's
brighter everything is better so just
from inside to outside well done Google
well done so the next award is going to
go to the bust of the year so okay
all right guys who do you think would be
the worst Fone best of the you this is
this is a weird one this is the award
you hate to have to give but I give it
every year anyway to a phone that gets a
shout out for how badly things went does
the rabbit or one count as a phone
because if it does to get this
award but this is a little different
from previous years and you'll see why
I'm going just jump right into it I'm
giving the bus of the Year award to the
Asus zenphone 11 ult giving it to that
terrible I think it was HTC phone
no hmd phone yeah you get a big red
trophy for this one Asus the 11 Ultra
did not win anybody's favorite phone now
if it's any consolation this is the
first year that I'm giving this award to
a phone that's not actually that bad of
a phone it's fine this it's a okay phone
if you bought it I'm sure you'd be okay
with it but the point is it's it's more
representative of the whole category
because the Zen phones that before this
Zen phone well you remember them right
those were actually really interesting
phones they won previous Awards they
took up some space in our heads as
smartphone enthusiasts where they were
actually giving us what we said we
wanted which was a flagship phone that
was actually small that was actually
one- handable that fit everything we
wanted into a compact size and then they
just turned it into this just another
generic big phone it's look at a camera
bump too it's fine but we we lost
something today with this end phone it's
gotten to the point where I genuinely
don't know if we're going to keep giving
out a best small phone award like phones
have like I said gotten bigger and
bigger and bigger and I gave you that
stat earlier about how the small phones
are all bigger than the big phones used
to be so does that mean we're going to
be giving out a best small phone award
to a 6 and 1 12 inch screen phone in a
year or two it just doesn't feel right
but maybe by that time phones will be
even bigger and it'll feel like a small
phone I don't know I haven't deed yet
maybe your comments will help me but
this is a bus of the year so our 10th
and final category in the 10th year of
the awards it's the MVP phone of the
year there's a lot of choice this always
feels like the highest pressure award
it's also my favorite just because what
phone do I choose to carry the torch to
sort of represent the entire year in
smartphones with all that we've just
talked about with all the exciting
features and the Risk Takers and the
comeback stories and the bust of the
year and all this stuff
funny if he gave the bust of the year to
the phone of the year one year that
would be fun gets the award and I think
my philosophy here is I am rewarding
overall greatness so there are a couple
runner-ups here that absolutely deserve
real Spotlight for a minute Vivo X200
Pro especially so like I didn't even
review this phone but again it came out
late this year and this phone this is
like God at all territory it's got the
awesome super right screen it's got the
great chipset it's got these incredible
cameras and that shooting experience
great battery life super fast charging
what doesn't it have maybe just the
Snapdragon 8 Elite chip at this point
although it does have a pretty great
mediatech chip that's no slouch and that
enables a lot of its features but in
general Ur in can't really go wrong
territory here keep you know I'm looking
around there's some other really good
ones here and I can't help but look over
back at the pixel 9 Pro fold from being
such a big comeback story for the pixel
fold series and such a good phone
affordable that I would actually daily
to this day and doing so many things
right this feels like I should highlight
it so here we are but it didn't win you
know what else feels worth highlighting
though this was the year of the base
iPhone especially getting way more
praise than the pro iPhone yeah it's the
colors right um and that makes sense I'm
pretty sure she bought the phone because
it was
pink this was the most complete base
iPhone they've ever made it's getting
Apple intelligence and all that but it
also got more RAM new colors I like the
matte rails this was a really good year
for not spending $1,500 on an iPhone but
also in these smartphone Awards I
typically want to give a shout out to
the phone that I am currently daily
driving I could use basically any phone
so maybe that means something to you and
so that would be this one this is the
pixel9 pro XL that is kind of dinged up
and scratch but this is the phone I use
I use the XL over the smaller one just
because of the extra battery life but it
didn't win we're rewarding greatness
here the MVP for
2024 is a Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra this
phone is just so good at
everything
wow Galaxy S it's Ryan Reynolds and I'm
here in the
north what do you guys think about that
phone of the Galaxy s24 Ultra and now
