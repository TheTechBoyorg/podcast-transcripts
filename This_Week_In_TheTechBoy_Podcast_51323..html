<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 51323.</h1>
<pre>we haven't packed episode today guys so
stay tuned
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
all right there we go hello and welcome
to the this week in the tech boy podcast
I promise you guys that I would talk
about uh there you go mix it with nice
and green uh my security but astute
views of the tech boy probably noticed
that the tech boy has switched to a new
site layout I hope you like the theme
we're probably about 90 functionality we
have most of our posts up here on mobile
you get a ham nice hamburger menu to see
here and if you want to see the rest of
the pages um it's probably here we're
going to keep iron rating over this so
we still keep our orange theme but we
know we redesigned to make the website
look less
um kind of bulky and more
fluent in front design and you know kind
of reminds me of the new not to be
designed so
great book anyway
um lots have happened in Tech
um Peter tried to rewrite the Bible with
the chat gbt Google released their new
phones with uh the book Google pixel 7A
and the Google pixel fold and
Samsung Galaxy a54 I think the price
dropped according to Tech Odyssey
awesome Samsung no it's not Samsung uh
what was I going to say oh yeah yeah I
also released my new article on AI and
how it's not going to take over the
world we'll see if uh do you believe me
or if you don't
um but first let's talk about my
security like I promised you I would in
the last episode
so this is just a browser window here
see it's just browse across it so I'm
going to switch my screen to show you
guys uh
there we go the full browser so the
whole screen
like the little window
all right here you go you can actually
see what I'm looking at right now this
is my website the techboy.org but I want
to show you some Chrome extensions that
I use to keep my device safe
all right so
guardio guardio is an extension that
prevents you from connecting to weird
websites and Etc I also have
Malwarebytes which come to the
Malwarebytes uh software under right
didn't get social creepy I don't know
how to get there anyway uh so those are
the extensions that I have to keep my
browser safe and not get hijacked by
beef we're still working on a debt but I
have a special episode which is going to
show you uh you're going to see it later
in the description today all right now
hopefully you can still see my screen
I'm going to share what's on my desktop
computer so right now you can't see me
but I'm going to show the antiviruses
that I use is AVG Antivirus
and that the Malwarebytes have must have
asked one a vast one is software that
lets you
um
has a free VPN so I'm going to actually
show what a basketball looks like right
now
an AVG system I can do typical antivirus
here it is a vast one
okay so since I live in Houston Texas
the closest the best one VPN is in Miami
so that's the one that's going to be
that that I'm going to be using
um if I turn it on or off right I get
five gigabytes per week
and then if you pay for all the disks
which I don't you'll get uh extra
functionality vowel Shield more VPN
firewalls and it can also quarantine
apps for free and it can also inspect
your network which I don't do what I do
use to inspect my network is a software
called glassware and glassware just
tells you what software is connect
internet and which IPS to connect them
to so if you had a virus that someone
got into your computer would tell you oh
look there's Commander control super
coming up that's controlling your
computer so I think that's really
important I think
um they're keeping your self and your
devices safe is really important
especially in this current landscape
where we have cyber attacks all the time
but I really want to get into this Peter
story Peter has allegedly
um Rewritten the Bible using GPT
um that's
true is really
really important all right
so according to my paid a story
originally reported on not being Peter
it's practically begging for God's Wrath
using charity between right Genesis it's
activity
um is uh software it's an AI tool that
allows you to write stuff and they
somehow like took chat GPT and put in
like the chapter of Genesis like I don't
know Genesis and then they rewrote it so
that everyone's like nice to animals and
whatever but this really messes with
timelines in the Bible so I'm like oh
it's just a little translation as far as
the interest is 22 where Abraham instead
of sacrificing the lamb he makes friends
with the lamp which is food and also
Rock and like
God's not happy and they're also selling
these on
line so that that's not good that
that is just not good
so do you think I don't know if Paige is
going to go first it because there's
lots of animals sacrificing in the Bible
so it's gonna radically change the Bible
change it began that's just not good and
they should not do that
all right but off the heels of that
story you may think that oh AI is going
to take over the world but nope it's not
going to take over the world because I
say it's just a tool and it's not going
to be a robot Revolution and I know some
of you guys may not believe me if you
think about it over the vast period of
time we had the steam engine we have
skyscrapers we have ships they all help
make things shorter then we have
computers rockets in the internet these
help make civilization forward they're
just communication faster and right now
ai only works with
usually with the internet noise data
sets can't just be stored on your phone
or like somewhere in an SSD so they have
to use the internet so if if AI were to
take over the world right
then you can just pull the plug and
while you may say oh guys look AI may
cut 80 of jobs in this sector which may
or may not be true I'm not making any
arguments for against that
every time new technology has come
like on the airplane replaced uh
transatlantic travel via ships like how
the internet replaced uh like people
doing research and libraries and it
didn't really replace Librarians but
probably lowered the number of that how
computers
um replaced um
like people some computers like doing
the math in the head and on paper
computers and calculators replace them
and just like how the steam engine and
trains the place families working
together but one by one weaving cloth by
themselves into the factory system which
built modern civilization which we have
today right yes all these things replace
jobs but now computers and factories
have created new jobs jobs aren't just
going to be destroyed by AI just like
computers replace human computers now we
have new totally new jobs music
youtubing blogging coding Etc
AI could just radically change coding it
can make it easier faster more efficient
but I'm pretty sure it's not going to
replace coding someone's always going to
have to be coding AI somebody even just
change the job a little bit also
AI May introduce new job so we haven't
seen yet maybe AI manager we've got AI
data set analysis or something like that
I don't know but I'm saying look AIS
will probably create new jobs
and just in this sentence you
um got in the 20th century people were
scared the water in Via nukes and YK
Tupac it's just this may be a 21st
century scale in the 19th century it was
afraid to change suffocate them but they
did not but I guess is coming and people
were scared right now I'm producer in 10
or 20 years is probably not going to
take over in broad world or whatever
and for our last story of this week
before we jump into Google I O but
releasing the pixel 7A we talk about the
extreme skins for s22 plus a few so I
finally did it I got my extreme skin I
reviewed it I wore it for months
and I say it's pretty doable just be
careful when you're installing it
and you'll be good
it feels nice the x22 process tint
overheat but this doesn't really
contribute that much too so basically
Samsung
and extreme skins
nice go hand in hand they do good skins
they have skins for Apple uh
uh Samsung Google
bro
OnePlus so they do skin for most most of
the companies out there and I don't hate
their customers like that other skin
what are they like
data skin company anyway
um before we move on to our Google pixel
story I want to show you just short
video I guess
and you'll you'll send me pictures of
them
excellent
all right that was a clip from my short
movie which will be linked in the
description of the uh thing below of the
description of this video below but yes
I'm
and you'll send me pictures of it
excellent
all right if as you can see in that clip
there's a software you called
Stormbreaker in there which is real
software you actually use real software
and recorded off of this thing uh off of
my phone and computer using actual
software and Stormbreaker is just a
phishing tool with your Samsung link and
they give access
to location you can get their location
and
yeah yeah so you can get the location on
the phone or even on the desktop
computer now there's some finickiness
using ingrark
um because ingrock's gonna be like oh
this is not Shakira or you'll have to
click this to continue or whatever just
for first time people who click the link
but if you're able to get someone to
click the link you'll be able to get
their location using storm breaker and
it's kind of where I can store a little
bit but using WSL too and my windows
terminal you can see that and you can
see more of how it's used with a slight
tweaking of editing I edited the
coordinate stash I've been you know docs
myself and to make the jokes a little
bit funnier
um
so I would index myself and make the
jokes a little bit funnier but
the software as well you can see it
there in use and how it's actually used
okay I'll link it to the channel and the
video
in the description okay
I told you guys this would be a packed
episode but now let's talk about the
Google pixel 7 a series and the xiaomi
Not Sorry Sony
um one mark five
hello oops
all right uh first jumping into the
pixel 7A looks like a nice upgrade over
the 6A has wireless charging and a 90
coach display screen which is probably
noticeable because people are mostly
able to notice the 61 and the 20 which
um jump from my Samsung front I usually
keep it marked at six to go to on power
saving mode super dip you know I like
the conserve battery but for those who
don't there's a manihitch mode uh no
telephoto but there is wire discharging
uh same 6.1 inch screen and people were
actually comparing it to the seven which
you know makes sense it has about the
same cameras I think the seventh cameras
are better but has a 64 megapixel sensor
you get all the Google AI features I
think Google said it was like 85 of
pixel 7 for 85 of the price but the
pixel 7 is now cheaper than it because
mid-service been on sale so what I
recommend to pixel 7A probably no it
does have a smaller screen 6.1 inches so
it's okay but I mean it has a 10 to G2
chip it has the nice AI features we'll
get three years of software updates I
was getting a Sam mobile article saying
that the Google sorry the Samsung a54
where I have to we'll create four years
of software updates it's going to go
from 13 to 17. but protect Odyssey uh
it's not it's kind of laggy that Xmas
check into it isn't that good but you do
get a bigger screen
more software updates and then you also
get the nice Samsung features and
software that comes along with it you
got Bixby no decks but you also get
secure folder and uh you know
Samsung's camera which is kind of raggy
but notice I have extra features I think
this one may have fun load I'm not sure
um but there's that now on the more
expensive Spectrum I actually data the
price drop so I only unveil their
the Sony one mark five which looks to be
like a nice phone so lastly the one mark
four had some heat management issues
with the Snapdragon H in one chip they
fixed this with snaps like an H into the
Chip And I also put some word in apps
and services put one back now the camera
and video apps are different but they
also have focus peaking some type of eye
tracking focus and uh
what else what was it some new Focus
like just new Focus systems all around
so it's upgraded as by the internals
um
still has the same like
size and 21.9 I think performance does a
4K display so that's the bezel so no
hole punch and uh
so has my quest thing and headphone jack
and speaking of bezels but no micro SD
or headphone jack Google also launched
the pixel phone so I'm going to be very
careful here because I don't want to get
blocked
um
the pixel fold has bezels
okay I like that kind of don't look that
good but uh the bezels allegedly hold
the components for the selfie camera
which I'll put Mr Boss is better than
Samsung's under display selfie camera
um the pixel Ford also has a better
aspect ratio so wider but shorter
bifonated screen on the outside
then the Galaxy C4 and it also has a
uh interesting hinge mechanism that
makes it 12.9 inches uh it's not high
inches millimeters when uh close so
that's interesting right there
which is better than Samsung
and it's almost as thin as the thinnest
foldable in the floor and this photo was
made by Google it's running pixel UI it
has like 120 hertz screen uh has a five
times Periscope uh telephotos camera no
status support no external monitor video
support right there so this foldable
seems more
I don't know
want a fun foldable like yes it's for
getting work done and it has all the
Google the apps you know docs Drive
Etc but
no video out no status seems like
Google's not really trying to
like make Samsung mad but
it's a good competition for Samsung
you know it's not going to be the same
old oh guys look here's what affordable
reviews recommended for you there's only
one affordable that's sold in the US
it's obviously against ej4 I don't hear
about some random people to report it
from but China to then you have to buy
some random No One's Gonna Do That
anyway
uh
I got a nice James interview Zeb Boykin
on YouTube so to check out that
interview that Boykin is talked about
digital displays with me
um last week and I uploaded it
um like a couple days ago
Thursday
so it's called digital displays with
step Boykin
let's just have a look
at that video this is the tech foreign
would you like to introduce yourself
yeah um yeah we can uh have my own
YouTube channel and
not really related to Tech but this is
what we do uh this is what I do we found
the business we do digital signage and
it runs off of Raspberry Pi's so if you
want to hear more about Zeb Boykins
business and how he runs things off of
the Raspberry Pi
oh I didn't even show it no all right
there we go anyway if you want to hear
more about Zapp boykin's business and
how he runs things off of raspberry pies
um and digital signage and how the
digital signage and economy Works check
out this video digital displays with is
that Boykin make sure to give it a shout
and the like and let's see if we can get
to 120 subscribers by the end of this
premium
all right
um let's see we talked about
Google we talked about Seb we talked
about
um
all the other
techy things that we're going to talk
about but there's one more thing that I
would like to talk about and that would
be uh how you're able to create
[Music]
TI games
using chat GPT
now my Tik was broken so it wasn't able
to transfer the game and I tried to
emulate it on an app but that didn't
work but I'm going to try to see if
there's a TI basic emulator on uh the
web we're going to do that right now
all right hopefully you guys can see my
screen without making that mistake again
there you go I'm going to do Tri basic
emulator and I want to copy and paste my
code from chat GPT and Google bard
[Music]
um
see if the games work I was watching a
very interesting video game video about
chat GPT right here we go it's an
emulator for
here you go
new file
I'm doing a TI Basics program so I'm
going to go to chat GPT
and
I'm going to copy and paste the code
that I emulated it even took out the
little Collins for me so that's nice
I also was able to test out some new
chat GPT apps they only let me do three
chat so it's easier just to go to the
church activity website on your phone
what do you guys think about your TPT
apps and chat uh
GBC being integrated into Snapchat all
right I'm going to give my take here
um it's kind of like replica my AI
friend and Snapchat being your AI friend
I'm the minority in a breadcrumbs 1993
to 7 about people thinking to check TPT
um integration into Snapchat was really
but I did it's interesting keeps you on
your phone longer which is good for
Snapchat which is kind of a Dying
program but
not Snapchat but snap the company which
is kind of a Dying platform and you may
say oh look you're on your phone longer
that's that's so bad look the company is
going to make money somehow but if you
don't want to be on the phone just don't
be on it like and no one's forcing you
to do the snap
Snap app so I mean
I'm fine with that
all right so I'm copying the code
without calling into the software to
write it on my phone let's see if we can
get it uh right here copying page
hopefully you guys can see this code
right uh
uh test I think
waits to check
let's give it a name let's call it a
game
oh let's do test
foreign
XP
so now I'm going to go back to the thing
upload the file which is another great I
have with
um
Edge
instead of having a nice little
downloads where I like see where my
cursor is down here where you can just
drag and drop the download up it's up
here somewhere but then it goes away
um sometimes so that that's one of the
problems I also have with Edge another
problem is in Chrome there would be a
nice little area right here where you
could search
uh of course you can see the specific
torch the floor right end of the uh like
where to minimize and uh maximize button
drawer
there was a little arrow that would uh
you could search throughout your tabs so
you know maybe chroma is a little bit
catching up to do and while that's
happening I'm uploading the game and
still here
see if I can play
is that working so we're going to leave
the site and see you know if you guys
have any other tips
on this or maybe you can send me a new
GoPro slash
uh
GoPro sorry GoPros there sir
TI charger that would be nice anyway
back to me
[Music]
we're going to be talking about
uh Samsung's Galaxy a54 now I'm Samsung
Galaxy a54 is an interesting device to
say the least
um
it has a big screen but you know
it has kind of like a pretty bad ship
and I know I've already said this but
Samsung really needs to step up in the
mid-range Department
like Samsung could just
do better
step up in the mid-range Department do
what Google's doing
and people really like the devices I
like to see a stylus
enabled mid-range device like Motorola
especially now that you can get the
Motorola uh
Motorola
Edge Plus
it was a really bad naming scheme 2022
for uh
duh
400 now which is really
really good
and
that's basically all I had to say one
more thing I want to show you
and I've
broken another record with tech Boy
again
uh
you know I'm just special like that
breaking records
more records let me just show you
I broke my second Babylon B headline
that's right
uh it's having a hard time loading oh
there we go to video I broke my second
Babylon B headline just like the Spotify
one where I showed you guys how you can
get Spotify to his face so church music
when
when you uh
oh there we go when you when you come to
church or a location
I just did this prophecy again
there we go
prophecy fulfilled AI will never will be
totally great for Humanity since man who
has never read a Sci-Fi novel
yep that's me I've never read a Sci-Fi
novel
I mean this Adventures
but it's not reading a Sci-Fi novel and
I said it's you know I'm not going to be
a threat so right here prophecy if I
feel like put me in the book of Prophecy
fulfilled by eight days Crossing
prophecies in Tulsa Oklahoma
okay obviously I'm just gonna puke and
it's a song called hunger which is
obviously never gonna happen
yeah well anyway I feel the Babylon B
prophecy I talk about Google pixels uh
device and how it's not work efficient I
talked about uh new software all right
new software called star baking soda my
new satire video just like the Babylon
bee
will you we are coming for you
and
um
remember to cancel the food I could talk
remember to cancel The Verge God bless
and talk to you later anyone out there
wants to sponsor this show or do a video
marketing I'd be totally fine with that
and remember please tell me if you like
this site or you like the old site
design anyway thank you God bless in
Tech talk to you later</pre>
