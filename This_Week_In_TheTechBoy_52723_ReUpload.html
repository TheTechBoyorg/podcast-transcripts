use the sentence or so whatever all
right so I'm in a new studio what's the
same different Studio

but we're going to get right into this
because we are plenty to react to We
gotta talk about this barcode scanner we
got to talk about the tech articles from
Twitchy not to be
um and Babylon B uh iPhone 14 video I'm
gonna be reacting to that we're gonna be
reacting to some new gymsy terms
uh like I did last time four months ago
in June let's see if I could win this
time you know maybe some of those terms
might come up again so I don't know this
but
the first thing is we're going to show
off the got questions Bible app and how
it's actually useful let's dove into it
and it's actually more useful than it
seems so as I pull this up both of you
guys will be able to see it
and while I'm putting the pin uh do you
guys use that questions the Bible app on
the website
so
we got
a question to you right and he says oh

articles and you can ask a question
so interesting app from got questions
highly recommend it
now on to our next topic
which will be reacting to some AI
generated art
so
let's screw that up hopefully you can
see
here it is
[Music]
hello I'm Benjamin Aaron Shapiro and it
gives me the unbelievable pleasure to
welcome you to the first ever AI
painting Series today we'll be doing
some fantastic AI generated artwork
inspired by the Deep recesses
the brain guys drive to talk like this
seriously like the whole video
behold
power of Technology okay so let's get
started let's enter some prompts and see
how good this AI thing really is I've
been told it's going to replace all of
us okay
I don't know what software
to use sound lemon sadly departed Don
Lemon but can we make him happy again so
let's do Don Lemon
wearing
is that a
h
Mac keyboard
a lemon costume picking lemons sounds
like a happy happy down lemon so let's
uh let's see how that how that ends up
oh goodness
wow he does look happy
interesting
particularly in that third picture he
starts off and he's kind of happy but
he's against the green screen then he's
like out in the he's having a good time
with the lemons he misses calling they
should have been this should have been
his life you have to make these
decisions because this is your world he
should have been like Willy Wonka of the
orchard that would have been that'd been
good good job AI good job okay we're
gonna do Justin Trudeau being pushed on
a swing by Fidel Castro his father
[Laughter]
I like what's happening right now ai
style here
so you get four pains
that's pretty good looks like it's
painting it's actually snow on the swing
that third one is so good
I love that and he's so happy just intro
he's the happiest he's ever been art is
one of those things that should make you
happy if it makes you happy
laughing as she rides an electric School
Bus across a Venn diagram
she's like she's like living her dream
right now I'm not sure I've ever seen
Kamala Harris happier than she is right
here that is a lady who loves electric
school buses man she loves them how do
you know that bus is electric down it
looks like a
actually she's more like
that's kind of yeah she loves those
buses man wow grumpy Pete bootage as a
train engineer

of hard work worthwhile oh my gosh they

like Prince When I'm gay it was his
[ __ ] yeah this is good well done AI
excellent Jay Powell setting money on
fire
foreign
money on fire well here's the thing
folks from hell maybe sending your money
on fire which is a reason why you should
diversify options
this is quite good okay
wow too real AI wow wow too real that's
that's a creepy movie right there
Anthony fauci as Dr Frankenstein
reanimating the corpse of Joe Biden
if I was just breaking
frankincense yeah I don't know why they
reversed it yeah he's getting it wrong
interesting because AI doesn't
understand the difference between Dr
Frankenstein and Frankenstein's monster
I assume that the internet is stupid and
so the internet doesn't understand the
difference between Dr Frankenstein and
Frankenstein's monster that's that's
creepy oh yeah
I mean either of those people or the
pictures Nancy Pelosi as the clown from
It holding a red balloon
that
I mean again AI making her sufficiently
terrifying that is that only slightly
less terrifying than she is in actual
life Nancy Pelosi actually like in in
this picture she's just like a clown
who's going to threaten children from
the sewers in real life she just wants
to abort like all the babies so there's
that it's a look it's a look okay Dylan
Mulvaney storming the beaches of

beer goggles women have like Pete
Davidson goggles or something I can't
explain it because then I talk to like
all the women I know and they're like
yeah Pete Davidson don't understand it
so I guess it only applies to
supermodels or something but yeah I
guess that's how Pete Davidson looks to
all the supermodel
green jump here

Pinocchio but you know anything about

to get it down let's be clear
let me be clear and are we done or there
any other things we wanted to hear
what hello
oh it's gonna be another hour probably
and with that I think we about have a
finished painting okay so yeah this
one's gonna be cut up a little bit
but on to our next story I promise I'm
gonna try to keep this uh upbeat our
next story
all right so we talked about explore
effects
[Music]
so
let's show you guys all right so first
of all it's good old-fashioned USB I
plug your phone into a PC using good
old-fashioned USB and that should work
uh of course you have to make sure to
allow access to your files
um throughout the photo settings in the
notification panel you can use Quick
show on Samsung phones because the
sensitivity assets for Samsung
it's in the single panel so it's the
three dots and then it says quick shift
uh Microsoft phone link that's also this
stuff about you you just have to set it
up pay it with your Wi-Fi your Bluetooth
makes you have the app it's
pre-installed on Samsung phones but you
have to download it on other phones such
as iPhones in non Samsung Android phones
BlackBerry and Symbian users are
supported on this device
all right and
it is
movie streaming site
explore Flex promotes good Christian
values it's a good content and gameplay
you picture a picture unfortunately
there was no app it's still a bad beta
it is not as much content
um but people remind me just tell you
guys that it's still in beta mode and
they'll be adding content but over time
but the content that they do have is
some job kids content chosen uh and some
original content the kitchen contents
kind of lacks but they have original
content and they're chosen to keep the
right now it's 9.95 a month wait for
articles to find out if you could even
locally tries to guess gen Zed slang No
Cap fixes and annoying title for video
all right here we go I want to take a
look at uh gen Z and they're going to
send me some phrases that these Savages
use and I'm going to try and guess what
Savages
I'm shocked I give that is that's not
right these phrases these primitive
phrases the Gen Z A Primitive right okay
he's probably right about that he's
using a mean and I in order to do this I
will be uh wearing it
an old straw hat and sitting here
rocking chair on my porch
let's get started they're going to put
these phrases up and I'm gonna guess
what they mean and we'll see if we can
somehow communicate with these poor
people who haven't grown old enough to
know anything no cap okay that means no
lie
No Cap uh obviously means uh where's my
cap stop the cap
if I act
uh I have no idea what that means I like
I like the pronunciation guide the only
thing I can think this this means is
that when somebody says you know to you
uh you know I just scored three goals in
a row in soccer you say No Cap because
because it's much more I know how polite
gen Z people are what does it mean
No Cap the expression No Cap is slang
meaning no lie so I was actually right
or for real often used to emphasize
someone is not exaggerating about
something hard to believe what's the
etymology of that though this guy is
there no crap I don't you know gee that
was a guess I actually got that right
she accidentally got it right didn't he
let's see another one
foreign
what
chewy
she she
I don't know which or something
what I look like a ginger or something
to you we've really discovered A
Primitive backward tribe here
a very strange language
I think it is
um the Zoomer translation of a hamlet
right or not
[Music]
to be or not to be that is the chugi I
have no idea what is a slang adjective
mocking someone or someone as uncool
they're out of time
the word jugi is
cool because it's not a word watch with
current trends are trying too hard to be
trendy similar slang terms are base C
participate in Tic Tac to enter and they
are already weeks old
how long is a twin last my goodness
thick or Normie where chugi is often
used ironically my mother is so chewy
she participates in Tick Tock trends
when there are already weeks old oh my
God what a snotty
crap he can't just smack him out yeah
I'll show you a chunky yeah little loud
hit you with my cane all right
drip it got to be you're a drip right I
mean it's got to be the same old thing
uh no it drip is like you're a nerd when
you've got the drip or are dripping it
means in slang that your look or style
is extremely fashionable what would that
mean
um
means
your second rate that is a slang term of
affirmation agreement or approval long
lines of cool or on down you can also
suggest doubt or disbelief yeah sure you
know so it's approval and disbelief
so okay
right there it's funny every generation
comes up with a new word for cool
this may be the worst
that's bad okay Boomer yeah I know what
that means that's not a word sir and
guess what I
[Applause]
got okay Boomers of viral internet slang
phrase used often in a humorous ionic
manner to call out or just miss out of
touch or closed-minded opinions the
social yeah yeah come on in the comments
just say that to me appreciated with the
baby boomer generation older people more
generally well you know what I think
you're unbet oh no he didn't I take that
slap this one at least is that me back
when I was a kid
I've heard
um what does that mean slap it means
something good right it means like
that's slap something
remains be excellent or amazing yeah so
if the pizza was good you're gonna say
that slapped
help this generation this generation's
hopeless I'll see I referred that one
it's a specially used refer to a song
someone finds extremely good because
this song slaps now that's I don't see
how they could even learn this word
since a song hasn't slapped since the
17th century
[Music]
uh when a track makes you want to get up
and move it slaps
when you get up and move away from the
cassette I mean uh uh phone my an
accidentally obviously especially used
music slaps or sometimes extended to
anything considered excellent or amazing
this past the slaps pasta
Abomination the new season of the show
slaps or this definition slaps hard AF
all right
low key is I know what Loki Loki is the
trickster god of the Norse myths okay
okay variously mean quiet restrained
moderate or easy that's what it always
meant it can also behave as an adverb
meaning of low or moderate intensity
ad website either like like I like
[Music]
I'm doing something but in a chill way
for instance we're having a party at my
place but keeping it low-key that's what
it's always meant I am an innovator
these stupid kids can't even invent
their own slang
simp is obviously a nerd or a wimp right
you know whenever you're scrolling
through quick section in the comment
section
uh
you'll see this word but
five to ten thousand times like you yeah
videos
okay if we raise enough money to give me
a friend spanking new episode I will do
the ice edits like that
simp is a slang insult for men who are
seen as too attentive and submissive to
women especially out of failed hope of
winning some entitled sexual attention
or activity from them which was meant to
troll young men for doing anything for a
girl to get some action he supposedly
deserves yeah that's what I so I guess
that one all too easy there is I'm
it's like dating
I'm gonna say that means laughable like
from risible is it that a word the
Zoomer would even know am I being
ridiculous ridiculous
there is like just like you know blowing
into a straw no this is a trackman this
charm or skill and flirtation it allows
one to easily attract romantic or sexual
partners I've lost my RIS but I think
it's a sign to focus on school what a
simp rizz up is the flirt with she's too
busying up that pre I don't
what shrimp rise up
she
this doesn't make sense in context why
would you
why why would you I'm just a flirt with
she's too busying up that I don't even
know what that means rizz man I wonder
what that etymology of that is these
people are strange strange fatty means
good right a female who can hold her own
and oh
lady like food July 11th 2016.
when
take care of herself she's very pretty
and independent she's a baddie she don't
take nothing nobody
with her body friend Russian
foreign
this reminds me of the time I use chat
gbt to try to modernize something and it
put in all these slang terms and I
started going after convulsions and then
I asked her to take the selling terms
out
that is when uh is it kissing now what
would you say if something was really
good I didn't know
this because I was gonna say if Tay I
didn't know your mama could
just busting oh it's AJ yeah
first of all you didn't capitalize I am
supposed to within the sentence
yay what is this King James Version
no your mama could cook this good yeah
her food be busting
no no
no no no I'm sorry you have to take that
one back the Zoomers have to replace
that with something more appropriate
oops appropriate like what like I don't
know
English
now in England in England that meant to
smoke out you know to figure something
out he sussed you out I'm gonna bet that
that English phrase has now come to
these benighted people in their Savage
land Savages suspicious yeah that's it
he called in sick on the day we all
stayed for every day we seems a little
bit sus to me uh they used it as kind of
a verb but it meant the same sort of
thing that's it all right well I uh
first guys jinji is doomed but not as
doomed electricity got too cheap and fit
into the countries that I just think
it's cutting back order in order to
drive up prices
so nuclear energy has been so productive
and over and feminent when a building
reactors like these well
they had to shut them down to drive
Energy prices up which is really
impressive
of course these guys are getting free
electricity he says quote Friday's job
for no zero on Wednesday of last week
and then they went up to only 0.3 since
book kilowatt hours like that
laughs
wow so that's a lot of energy that
nuclear can produce it's really
interesting and look at this picture
here it's a good cool fat gasoline
Germany
but you know that's a good news story
here here is a slightly bad news story
for all of you Microsoft users out there
this is the reason number 200 why I
don't use a Mac
I'm just gonna let you read that
now that starts away
they they
read this tweet quote from Microsoft 365
Insider uh with some side note this is
the new Microsoft 365 app
they that's an artwork the email app
let me zoom in so I can show you just
this this is just is this better
okay ah
yeah
and over to the next uh We're not gonna
do this toy anyway so speaking of in TV
one of the most interesting stories one
of the stories that probably would have
came from a gym to you but
didn't
it sounds like it comes straight from a
Gingy tick Tucker well no it's not it's
from
the Indian so Indiana they 've been
Indian official ordered an entire
Reservoir trained to find his phone
after he stopped dropped it while taking
a selfie this is this is NTB level right
here
he was suspended after he drained in a
central Reservoir to find his phone he
they said divers in they couldn't find a
phone right he dropped it in he drank
the reservoir into some nearby Field
pumping millions of water out of the
camera gotta dab in central India
he was suspended and guess what guess
what
the phone didn't work when he recovered
it because it was unknown
tons of water what do you think so
happens gonna happen and his excuse for
it was get this it had sensitive
government data on it
one of his India's Rivals
diving in the day I have to go swimming
into the into the river to go recover
your Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra because it
says like a 1 200 Galaxy phone
and go down there and get all the
government data off what were you
thinking you dreamed a dab to get your
phone
just two days to
pump out all the water millions of
liters of water were pumped out I mean
this is this is
crazy that is just
the
no
he has been suspended because he wasted
gallons on top of gallons of water which
yeah of course he suspended but that's
just crazy that no
all right we have a review to do right
now
we have the uh barcode scanner
Terra scanner model uh 5100
thank you to Galaxy tech review for
sending me this device
all right so this device comes with a
charging cable
and a little tiny qsb dongle that's
around here somewhere
but this cable also works with
here so you can charge it
like such and also when it's plugged in
to your computer
oh wrong way
okay it comes with a little book so you
can program it
um it's only 1D so it doesn't work on QR
code but it does work on barcodes so I
have this
magazine here
oh here it is
down at the bottom of the screen right
here
it is connected to my computer and I'm
going to share my screen
okay so look at the top of the
here see there's a QR code from it
doesn't look right
well it wouldn't have worked anyway yeah
Crystal got that I want to scan my book
now
and note the uh address
boom
soups and it found the code fun my
answer is Genesis magazine it is fast it
can scan 1D barcode extremely useful and
it's also Wireless if it's if you use
the wireless function then of course you
have to plug the dog into the computer
and
make sure that this is charged but it
doesn't have to be charged I think if uh
it's random like that so yes that is a
1D barcode scanner
and before we leave we have one more
video
it's about the iPhone
14. and if you have to get your kids one
so you know the debate over if you get
your kids an iPhone is here and the
astute
Tech website you know known for their
commentary
uh
has weighed in I'm discussing on if you
scared look at the iPhone 14. as you all
know I am the founder of Apple Tim Apple
please clap
here at Apple we believe you should
think different
and that's why you need to do what all
the other parents are doing and get your
kids
an iPhone
Samsung
three cameras instead of two that's all
I have to say
iPhones aren't just great not a 14
that's a pro but okay for turning adults
into distracted irritable drones they
can now ruin children's brains too
just think of the possibilities
all the worst people in the entire world
will now have instant access to your
kids 24 7. I mean
ish but that is an exaggeration
and also
by the same flips go into that logic all
the best people have
himself so
and there's nothing you can do about it
uh what is he talking about
hey
there's like those
family plan thinking about it well you
could just tell your kids not to talk to
strangers and trust him which is why you
get them to phone and the first place
but it's a stretch but okay
I haven't had that awkward birds and the
bees talk with your kids yet now you
won't have to because they'll have
access to all kinds of the weirdest
pornography at all hours
hold for Applause
when they're as young as seven or eight
years old they'll learn all about sex
okay and frankly they'll know more weird
sex stuff than you could ever dream
is this one
okay
how does that even work
I don't know I'm gonna have to ask my
kids
are you worried that your kid won't fit
in with all the anxious depressed
mentally ill kids
dang
well we are here first guys get to an
iPhone to anxious depressed and mentally
ill which is why
is it school now that you've gotten them
an iPhone they are sure to develop at
least 17 new mental illnesses within the
first month or your money back that is
the Apple guarantee
if you don't get your kid an iPhone they
won't fit in with all the other kids
they might even stay straight or even
worse cisgender
and worst of all they might not even
become a furry Apple has partnered with
social media companies like Instagram
Tick Tock and Facebook to ensure that
your kid will be 100 brainwashed into
woke idea man they said they said
appointed with not to be
you won't have to parent your kids
anymore because they'll be parented by
some blue-haired lady on Tick Tock which
let's be honest leaves you more time to
tune in to the next even woker season of
Ted lasso only on Apple TV
it's the right choice it's the only
choice it's of course the mandatory
choice
and if you don't get your kids an iPhone
well let's just say that President XI
won't be too happy with you
what
think different
star unless you don't want to like what
you think
yeah
and one more thing Apple has entered
into a groundbreaking relationship with
Samsung
Windows Zune and Paul
soon
you mean the MP3 players
Paul Paul president since 2019 and why
on Earth just a windows logo from 1998.
ensuring that no matter if you use
iPhone or a lesser device
full power
this thing has decks for crying out loud
I have Sun food on here how
your kids will be sexually indoctrinated
what about LG LG well they do sell
iPhones and LG stores so
[Applause]
hey you oh there's no there's no uh
hey this this is function but yeah
uh you know one of those frontal
controls by yeah thingies all right
well
well I believe that's all I have for you
today
good night God bless take talk to you
later and God bless America</pre>
