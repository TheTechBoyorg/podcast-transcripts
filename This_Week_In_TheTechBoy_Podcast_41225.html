<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 41225</h1>
<pre>Welcome to the This Week in the Tech Boy
podcast. Today is a very important day,
not only because I have a debate coming
up in the next three hours over on
Lizz's uh X space. Hopefully I win,
though expectations uh online are low.
In fact, when I asked for help in the
debate, it was a 19 to1 of people
telling me to drop out compared to uh
you know, actual help uh and also people
calling me heretical as well. So, you
know, it's more of the same over there
on X as well. Anyway, today is an
important important day because today is
the day that lines up in SA LTW history
as you guys may remember. Um, and by as
you guys may remember, I mean only me
because I'm the only one who listens to
these. In fact, I need probably should
go back and go listen to some of the
older podcast episodes I I did. Um, you
know, a because I had pretty good
content back then. Honestly, some of
that content is was better back then
than it was now. A lot more interesting
and exciting. In fact, one of my
favorite episodes was from 2023 was when
we ranked some of the best VBS theme
songs
uh from Lifeway Kids. Um so far, In the
Wild has yet to be beat. Speaking of In
the Wild, um that is a theme song that I
tested the HP X360 laptop on compared to
the uh Samsung laptop I had. It was much
better on the laptop I'm using right
now. um with the speakers. Uh so much
better because the speakers instead of
being like downward firing, I think
these are upward firing. You can
actually see them here on the keyboard.
If I had the movable camera, I'd show
show you to them. Um either way, I do
need to put out that video. It's been on
the tables. It's like literally on the
table. It was taped on the table since
like August of 2024. And like I think
the Longhorns won a game that day.
Anyway, uh anyway, back to from that
long winding thing. It's uh the summit.
So last week, last year this was a
Friday and I recorded a podcast episode
and the reason was because on Saturday
SSA had created and had done the most
important and
most I guess historic achievement of all
time of course and um it's that time of
the year. So um SSLtw has its new
episode. Wow, we already have a chat has
its new article out right now. the
summit. We did it. Denver uh where SSA
and the uh and their allies. What? What
is
this? Oh, wow. It's Star-Lord. Hello,
Star-Lord. Uh he's in here for today.
What is this? I'm not inviting any
guests. What is this
layout? Anyway, uh the the summit where
uh Ethan Sheay uh finally is able to put
together his monthsl long plan of
combining together all the alliances and
all the uh and and all his political
capital and all his maneuvering and all
his information from CSM Christian
Social Media, which you know he was
kicked off of uh from NTB. Wow. Uh wait,
you can get chat on here from X.
Interesting. Queen Christy, who's not
Queen. Wait, who put that name there?
Nonetheless, uh the summit
uh I walked into school, planned locked
and loaded, filling a familiar drill of
a strategy about to unfold. The first
objective was locating Hazel's sister
for unfortunately for us, we were going
to have Hazel uh invade Gcam for us and
be able to uh acquire political capital
that way. Unfortunately, her sister
didn't come in time. And um spoiler
alert cuz I know like none of you read
this website so might as well just tell
you who like all six of you are
listening which means we're breaking
viewership records which is kind of
funny. Nonetheless
uh these people
uh she she when she finally came to the
school she opted to decline um from
invading G cam. So Gono didn't want to
invade J Cam and Hazel sister also
didn't want to invade Gcam. So you know
G cam was uninvadable unfortunately. Uh
anyway, the summit. So here we have
Ethan Shay standing over here saying,
"We did it, Denver. I walked into school
playing locked and loaded, feeling the
familiar door strategy here." And then
he goes in, he talks to uh you know, G
cam over here. G Cam tries to do their
little maneuvering and etc, etc. I
investigate Kendra Scott for this
reason. Uh the store, not the person. I
didn't know Kendra Scott was a person
until we did the investigating and then
some person on Reddit called me out,
yada yada yada. Then we talk to Summer,
we talk to uh uh Clarissa, we talk to
all these people. We get them together.
We get them to agree. Then G cam tries
to maneuver, you know, with some stupid
little prom plan that we all know it's
not going to get approved. So, you know,
I was like, "Nope, I veto that one right
there." So, you know, VP Geneva, um,
sorry, you're out. Okay. I just like
basically laugh in her face. So, you
know, good times, good news. Uh,
definitive victory or calculated manus.
I mean, you have to think about how this
is, you know, one of the most historic
achievements of all time. I mean, this
this is like, you know, groundbreaking
and earthshattering if you think about
it, right? We were able to essentially
get new policy um set, not just for me,
but for all the other people here said
in the story. This has never ever
happened before. Um the people in CSM
were being so unhelpful. They had me
like going on these like side tangents
being like, "Oh, well, what are they
going to wear?"
quote. Okay, look. I don't care what
they're going to wear. Okay, they they
could wear like a flamingo outfit for
all I care. You think I'm going to sit
around here and start yapping about what
they're going to wear? What? You think
I'm going to bring in like Got Questions
Modesty War 3? You think I'm going to re
reitigate that? No. Okay, look guys. Um,
in 2022, um, as you guys may remember,
November 9th, 2022, really, really
important day. Also, November 9th of uh
20 2019 was also kind of important to
always these November 9th. You think I'm
going to sit around here and um you
know, kind of be like, "Hi guys. So, um
we're going to be like measuring. Yeah,
we're actually going to have like a
little measuring stick." No. Okay.
Uh-uh. Uhuh. First of all, like a
uh like you know, we in like April,
we're like, "Forget NTB. Forget forget
not to be. We're not going to listen
here and stand around and listen to you
people uh be like, "Hey guys, you know,
Ava Hooper is quote unquote immodonest."
No, I don't care. Okay, shut up people.
She has like 12 followers and you people
are like, "Oh, wow. Man, this is
terrible. Wrong people."
Anyway, so no. Um NTB very very
unhelpful there. Um what are they going
to wear? Heck, you think I care what
they're going to wear? Um, second of
all, so um, we we we had to put up with,
you know, that from CSM, we had to put
up that from,
uh, you know, all these old people
coming around. Uh, also, you know, the
it's just like impossible to get
together. And also, you know, Maverick
wasn't that helpful. So, there's that.
Uh, and then I reactivated channels back
into Liberty Prep because we still
trying to track down David, who hasn't
received contact from since 2021.
Uh, and then of course we anticipated
this. Of course, this was part of the
plan. Um, but where G Cam essentially
flaked out and said that he couldn't do
it. But we did pick up Denver anyway,
which is fine because look, the the
entire event of it happening, it didn't
actually have to happen. It just has to
be because, you know, precedent setting.
If we can get an agreement that says
yes, this is legal. Um, then, you know,
trickle down rule economics happens and
then, you know, it it's legal for, you
know, the rest of life. It's like
basically codified. So we essentially
created a new rule where allowed us to
do something instead of you know
restricting something. Uh which is where
those documents from SSTW basically come
in and essentially this is very
important because it spreads democracy.
Um it allows SS power to be project
right you think about it. Gcam power was
able to projected to the mall all the
time. You know even though Gcam power
was kind of collapsing within within
school you know GM power could project
anywhere and everyone to the mall. I
mean they had cars they could drive
anywhere they wanted to. Uh you know
people in liberty uh they also had
power. they could project anywhere they
wanted to as well. So you know this
essentially means SSA is able to project
power anywhere else they are able to as
well since winning the war as well. All
right, that's uh the latest from SSA
Declassified. Um and of course the
dating doctrine kind of helps
um give in some of the context and
background and also explains how the SSI
constitution essentially allows for any
strikes on any time on any person as
long as they strike first kind of sort
of right. So let's say hypothetically
you know uh one of these you know
students here start a crush war then SSA
can just go in and activate nuclear
force. Uh an example of this would be
let's assume that the SSA constitution
existed in 2019 against Nika and and
Nika you know she starts the war and
then well SSA is essentially uh legally
legitimized to use force as well. So
here we go into the dating doctrine to
explain this one as well. This
constitution should be
linked. Ah, there it is. Here's the
constitution link. This is one of the
longest articles because it was actually
combined one article into two. So we
could get these articles to sync up to
the correct time. It's actually, you
know, on 4:13. So yesterday would have
been the anniversary. But, you know,
tomorrow, Sunday, that's when we uh
podcast. All right. No new chats yet,
but we still have wow, eight people
watching. Viewership alltime record,
eight people. Um here's the SSA rules
and constitution here essentially
claiming that room 16B is a sick
Christian nation nicad doctrine and
observative property come over the ACDMS
antichrist defense missile system/ ally
system tating is strongly discouraged
due to national security threats and the
idioty of it as well and since we have
the right to bear phone weapons could
such balls it also applies to drones
freedom of Christianity and religion my
campaign advisor from 2022 tried to get
me to change it so I changed it for him
then I changed it back back in 2022 two
and the opposition can strike SSA
directly or indirectly which would lead
to a declaration of war. An example of
this would be the battle of the goldfish
of 2023 essentially when the uh Mali and
uh Valerie like stole Denver's goldfish
then we declared war on Mahali as well
she also like to assure him so you know
totally justified totally justified
there as well. So, always remember to
have a like a back door, a back way out
to be able to legitimize or justify any
action. All right. Um, let's go back to
the camera. Wait, we we stream kind of
just like changed up the way this
software works
today. All right. Now, let's go over to
our first tech topic of the day, which
is the light phone. Yes, I know we
talked about that last time, but I mean
this phone this this phone is such a
scam. Okay, like this phone like
what? The light phone is retailing for
$799. And this I did an entire video
about it last time, but we have to talk
about this. Okay. And the one market
that they have not entered yet is the
teen tech market. And you know why they
haven't entered the teen tech market?
It's because this phone is obscenely
expensive and it's an e in display now
on and in in in 2023 in October we were
like hey guys maybe parental control
apps are like spyware and malware and
maybe like the bark phone and the gap
phone are complete and utter trash right
for those of you who don't know the bark
phone and the gap phone essentially take
like some low-level $75 Samsung phone
and they're like hey guys internet bad
yes internet bad we I don't want kids to
end with. Therefore, they take these
phones, they put their little software
that kind of locks stuff down on it and
they say, "Hey, this phone doesn't have
internet." They take $75 and they sell
it for like $150 because they have a
profit. And then they go out and, you
know, promote and lobby be like, "In
bad. Internet scary. Don't let your kid
on the internet." And you know sometimes
it some sometimes seeps over into like
you know Christian Christianity like you
know plugged in focus on the family
social media bad yada yada yada.
Nonetheless the light phone would be a
great opportunity for this. However I'm
not endorsing that. Okay. I may or may
not have allegedly may have not you know
hacked a gap phone or attempted to
allegedly maybe. Um nonetheless the
light phone has it's playing every game.
Like I said, they're playing like the en
environmentalism game. They're playing
the big tech bad game. They're playing
the minimalism game. They're playing
like heck the management. They're
playing the small phone game here at
this point. They're they're playing the
wow guys eating is great game. They're
playing all these games. The one game
that they cannot break into is the this
team tech space game. Even though the
rock phone and the gap phone are wildly
overpriced and essentially are kind of
lies as well. If you think about it, you
know, these phones pride themselves on
not having internet, which is why
they're worth $75 more than what they're
actually worth because you can go back
and buy what the phones are actually
worth. Again, with the light phone, if
you were to buy a phone for $400, you
get so many more features. You can buy a
like a launcher and lock it down to what
the light phone has itself, right? $800
for this phone is obscenely expensive.
It doesn't even make sense, right?
The light phone cannot enter into the
teen tech market because no teen, no
parent, no sane parent at least is going
to buy this compared to say an $800
iPhone or even $500 Samsung or even a
budget $100, you know, on the like
floors of Best Buy and in the aisles of
Walmart and Home Depot um esque phone.
It's just not going to happen. And like
this is the one era in which they can
make sense. Why is this phone
$800?
$800. Yes. Even those quote unquote no
internet phones that cost in retail for
$150. They have internet. You know how I
figured that out?
Easy. The phones have GPS built into
them. So then the parents can track them
because, you know, I guess the kids have
things to do, places to go. So like you
know it'd be kind of like you know in
SSLW the summit if like all the rules
that then got applied in the summit the
I guess the friendship outing act of
2024 which you know we have the the
uh what's that act from 2019 to
2022 that we kind of used to for
legalism. What's it called? Oh yeah,
the Sit with People Act of 2019 to 2020.
Let me let me go see what the act's
called. Um, specifically, essentially,
we tried to use that act. It It was an
act that got repealed in November of
2022 that essentially said that if
someone invites you to sit with someone
at lunch, you have to do that. So, we
tried like here it is. We tried so hard
to kind of like stretch that like it was
a legal theory that we're working with.
were kind of like, well, you know, if
someone invites you to a table and you
have to sit with them, maybe, just
maybe, if someone invite you to some
place 15 miles away, you also have to do
Yeah, that's kind of what like what we
were uh working with as well. Let's see.
So, yeah, that that's how much I had
make the make friends act of 2019 to
2022. That's what it's called. Uh you
can see it here on the screen right
there. So yeah, that that's you know how
much free time I had to be playing
around like this. But I guess let's
assume that the make friends act of 2019
to 2022 doesn't apply to this
hypothetical kid because they already
have friends or something. But the uh
internet bad act of 20 uh 2007 to
2027 applies to
them. And you know, like your parents
are like, "Okay, you can get the bark
phone. You can get the gab phone. You
can get the pin wheel phone. Oh, you can
get the light phone." No sane child is
going to be like, "I'm going to get the
light phone." No, it doesn't make sense.
First of all, it's super duper small. It
It doesn't even allow any features
though. I mean, technically, I guess you
could kind of port like YouTube onto it
because it's just a random Android
phone, but like it's in black and white.
It's in black and white. They're selling
a phone for $800 that's in black and
white.
just that's just wrong. Okay, look that
there should be laws against
this. I mean that's just
wrong. That's
criminal. And they that's the only
reason they have not played internet bad
team for for teams game. It's just cuz
like why would anyone buy this? Why?
Now, here's another phone that I'm so
glad that you can react to videos again
cuz I have these Delta class trash
earbuds, but you know, it's it's
something. It's something. Uh, we're
going to be reacting to Google Pixel 9a
versus iPhone 16, which clear winner
here would obviously be the Google Pixel
9a, no matter what anyone says. And I
also like this flat design. Thank
goodness for the flat design. I mean,
honestly, I mean, is the iPhone 16
technically better than the light phone?
Well, is the phone in black and white?
No. Okay. Well, see, it's
better. But, I mean, is it almost as
much as a scam as that? Mhm. Yep. Mhm.
Like, that phone really should not
exist. Okay. Sam these people are trying
to Apple's trying to sell this phone
with one camera as like it's a feature.
No, it's not a feature. Just like having
lack of internet on the phone is not a
feature. Okay? Unless you're like the
president of the United States and you
have like Iran and Russia trying to hack
into your phone, then the lack of
internet is not uh a feature on a phone.
It's just, you know, you steal. Also,
the president of United States makes
$400,000
uh a year. So, they can afford a secure
phone for him. All right, here we go.
So, the Google Pixel 9 A versus the
iPhone 16E. I watched the video, but you
know, we're going to talk about this.
$499, $599 here. So, it's a $100
difference. So, which of these two
companies actually gives you more? I'm
going to rate the phones. Let's look at
this. Which which company do you think
gives you more? Well, you know, first of
all, Google gives you more screen. It
gives you more cameras. Uh, you know, I
think it's also lighter where that's a
turn time and less is more. So, um, I'm
going to go with Google for here based
on how good I think they are in each
category out of 10. And then at the end,
we're going to factor in the price and
choose one as the definitive winner. So,
as far as what you get with the phones,
both Google and Apple these days offer
you the ultimate in uh, environment
conservation. Environment conservation.
Environment conservation is just so
annoying. Okay? Like these people are
like, "Oh, we got to save the trees. We
got to save the planets. We got to save
all this. We got to build the
windmills." Windmills are so trash.
Okay. Windmills. Windmill. Okay. Hey, I
had to do like these stupid
environmentalism, climate change, global
warming thingies in school. Okay, that's
one like, okay, it's a scam. Okay,
they're like windmills. Who thought that
was a good
idea? This is like this eco-friendly
packaging. Think about windmills. You
have these windmills, you know, you have
the the top, you have the fans that fans
out 20 ft of blade. The materials are
not not even recyclable. And yet, you
know, you have like 40 feet of land
that's just like there, but you can't
use it because, you know, like you can't
build anything there. You can't grow
anything there. It's gonna take it's
going to be too loud um for anything
there. You can't build a house there to
be too loud to grow anything there. And
even if you wanted to grow something
there, you have like birds that and
insects and things are going to have to
come in here and, you know, pollinate.
And but guys, guess what? The birds come
in, they get like torn up by the uh they
get torn up by the windmills. The
windmills just trash. Okay. Like, no.
Just put a nuke nuclear plant there or a
coal plant or oil plant. Just be normal.
Okay. Why are you people building
windmills here? Like, Apple, I don't
care about your net climate carbon goal.
2030 push back 2050 push back 20. I
don't care. Okay? Just make a good
phone. Apple will never make a good
phone. But, I mean, at least try. Okay?
At least try to make a good phone with
Corbin, then without Corbin. Like, who
who cares? Okay? Like, please. And all
these are good. Just put a charger in
the box. Okay? And this is this is a
Google 2. Put a charger in the box. Put
a charger in the box. Apple.
Okay. Basically nothing. With the Pixel,
you get no case, no screen protector, no
charger. Just the cable, the phone, and
vibes, which I
mean that's kind of probably had to like
kill off like unboxing channel except
for unboxing a phone today. Here we have
the phone and we have a cable. And you
know what? this phone does because it's
the same thing as all the other phones,
you know, no new features, uh especially
if it's an iPhone. And also,
um like there's no good apps for it.
Speaking of apps, um we're going to be
doing a gaming stream. So, uh today cuz
I have like three hours to kill to like
like debate and hopefully don't lose. Um
hopefully, you know, hopefully I win.
You know, winning is good. You know, I
usually don't lose debates, but you
know, this one might be a bit harder. So
anyway, we're going to be like
podcasting for two hours and maybe I'll
switch over. Um, we have like some
interesting mobile games on my phone
that I found for testing and review
purposes and I'll let you guys pick. Of
course, you guys are going to have to
chat. So, do that. I I don't see
anything. It says like nine people
watching. Did Did nine of you people put
me on mute? Like, did you just mute the
tab? And then be like, "Yep, we were
going to give this kid a view, but you
know, it's not a mute." All right.
Anyway, uh, prove it by chatting
something. All right, fans. All right,
let's go.
Except not really any vibes. And then
over in Apple's corner, it's exactly the
same story. Cable at the bottom and the
phone. So, a very mediocre start, but
also a very similar start. I give Why do
you get points for this? Four point.
Wow, guys. You get four points for
including the phone that you bought in
the box. I mean, if they didn't include
the phone in the box, that would
literally be fraud. Well, look,
Christiey's here. All right, that's
good.
Both of these phones, four points for
box contents. And the similarities, they
only ramp up. I mean, the thing that
actually convinced me to make this video
comparing these two phones is look at
the designs from the frosted backs to
the logo placements to the flash being
just to the right of the camera. Even
the texture and the curve of the
aluminium on the side rails. It very
much feels like we're looking at Google
and Apple's take on the exact same phone
concept. Two Well, I mean, what else
were they going to do? I
mean, it's it's a phone. What What What
do they want it to look like? Two
devices that feel designed to go
headto-head. And while I have to say, I
do like the fact that Apples has a glass
back as opposed to Google's plastic.
Yeah, plastic's pretty fine. Also, you
know, it's going to be in that case
anyway, so I guess Apple decided after
the iPhone 5C back in the day totally
bombed that materials were one thing.
That's not even the iPhone 5C, but
whatever. That they couldn't flex on,
but then in other ways, very much flex
on. It's just that the way that Google
has finished their plastic, it doesn't
really feel any different. This doesn't
feel like a cheaper phone than this.
They both feel like fancy phones. They
both have IP 68 ratings now. It's good.
I'm quite impressed. Also, this is like
the tiniest camera bump that I've seen
in the last 5 years, apart from Red
Magic, who's managed to go completely
flush. Now, I do have a pretty major
problem with this, but aesthetically
speaking, I like it. So, for design, I'm
going to go eight points to Pixel, eight
to the iPhone. Nah, I mean, Google Pixel
design is just better. I
mean, you got you you got two cameras.
That that's got to be worth at least a
point. Completely neck and neck so far.
So, what about the displays? Well, the
second that you turn these two phones
on, one thing becomes quite clear that
obviously. I mean, look, this thing got
a notch. This thing has a punchable
hammer, which why? If we're considering
the full spectrum of phone displays out
there, neither of these guys is winning
any awards. I mean, the Pixel is
surrounded by a border that's at least
20% thicker than you'd want it to be at
this price. And the iPhone, I mean,
sure, but like the people who buy it
aren't really going to care, okay? The
people who buy this are going to be like
kids. They're going to be smart kids,
you know?
not buying the light phone. They're
going to be like, you know, people
upgrading from older devices. These
people are going to be having like
little border bezel measuring
competitions. H I don't know. I I don't
know what kids do. I don't know what
kids do. Maybe maybe they do just sit
around and measure the bezels of their
device at home, you know.
Has a notch. I thought we were done with
notches. I was so happy to be done with
notches. I guess better than the dynam
dynamic island of making something
mid-range giving you tech that's one
step back from the current seamless
dynamic island. I mean this is kind of a
step back from 2017 seeing as only has
one camera. Apple hasn't released a
phone with only one camera since the
iPhone 10R from 2018 when you know that
was kind of sort of acceptable. Not
really because you know LG introduced
the concept back in 2016 reintroducing
it from the 3D phone concept of 2011 to
12. So you
know but you know at least for the time
the design was futuristic or at least
iPhone 10s is uh which was you know
futuristic. I remember reading about
this thing ongo news when it came out in
2017. It was I was like no because they
were like higher than Samsung.
Uh, in terms of
numbering, you know, before I did all
these, you know, random debate over 1x
with random people, um, I always, you
know, debated Samsung versus Apple. So,
you know,
while sitting clearly one step forward
from the straight up black bars that
you'd get across the cheaper iPhone S.
Oh, I forgot about the iPhone SE. So
yeah, they did lose that one camera, but
that was like from 2022 when they were
just like stealing the 28 to
20 what 17th line, right? Yeah. But I
mean, even iPhone SE's didn't retail at
this price. So iPhone SE are $449. Still
bad. Okay. You shouldn't be having, you
know, like you could like take a shower
in that. You could dive. You could swim
in that vessel. Okay. You guys could be
having little splash pad parties in that
bezel.
Either way, not a huge fan. And I'd
actually side towards the Pixel just
generally with display. The 9A is a lot
brighter than last year's 8K and so
definitively outclasses the iPhone. I
mean, it does. Even in like 1440p, I can
see that this white is brighter than the
white on the right. Outdoors, you know,
if you're into that. Plus, Google's
managed to get a 120 Hz refresh rate
onto here. That's good. Congratulations.
And to the 11 people watching the chat,
do you guys Oh, do record-breaking. Do
you guys have a 120 Hz displays on your
uh devices? Let me rephrase. Apple
hasn't managed to get a 120 Hz refresh
rate onto here. That feels like the
bigger headline. So, almost everything
feels quite a bit smoother over at team
Google. Although, weirdly, this is one
of the very few phones I've seen with
which you get a high refresh rate
display, but it's turned off by default,
so most people won't end up using it.
Bear in mind the iPhone is slightly
higher resolution so videos might look
interesting though, you know, I play
with resolution settings on my phone. I
really don't notice uh the change
sometimes a little crisper and it uses
stronger glass on the front. So when you
factor in everything, it's not a massive
display lead. Yeah, I mean maybe just
stronger glass is there, but there is
glass on the back. Classic stronger than
glass. So it's kind of a wash for
durability for Google, but it is a lead
nonetheless. So Pixel gets seven, iPhone
gets six. All right, let's go. Google in
control in the lead. Up by one.
And while we're watching content on the
phones, how's the audio quality? This is
Pixel.
I wonder what song that is cuz you know,
I wonder if Liflight worship likes me
testing devices. Uh using the wild and
like the NAS.
Now this is iPhone.
the iPhone sounds like a bit louder. Uh
I watch this on the phone and I also
watch this, you know, using these like
essentially free earbuds. So the iPhone
does sound a tad bit louder on that one.
Maybe it's just cuz you use this side of
the ear from this side of the ear. It's
essentially a wash like 0.1 over the
Pixel.
Also, that's not a real song. So, okay.
The iPhone sounds very good. Like as
good as its flagship counterparts. You
feel like you're hearing the full range
of your music right down to the bass.
That phrase like my music or your music
like oh I'm listening to my music. You
didn't write the song. It's not your
music. Also, it's almost as annoying as
that phrase uh that part. It's just used
by a whole bunch of annoying people over
on uh that stupid serious XM channel.
What's it called? The urban view. Yeah.
I mean honestly I mean that that should
the channel shouldn't exist. Like why?
Who listens to
that? Like if you ever want to hear
annoying people screech and yell at
you for and like pre-recorded annoying
people screech and yell at
you,
why? Just just
why?
Anyway, back the Pixel is still very
much acceptable phone audio, but just
noticeably more compressed sounding. But
then the other side of the audio baby
like like the little the squeak sound
that he likes to use in the thing for
like those little Pokémons. Do you guys
think Pokémon is satanic? What do you
guys think? Which is every bit as
important is how clear are your phone
calls? I have, you know, I was actually
impressed when I got to this part
because, you know, phone call quality is
very very
uh just
like
just just overlooked in cell phone
reviews. I did a little parody skit of
like a cell phone review in 2004 and
that was already talked about. Now
you'll be able to hear about it like
like remember that one thing from PC Mag
and I probably should turn this into
like a meme or something where it's just
like hey guys these are top apps it's
Amazon, Instagram, Reddit, Tik Tok,
Google Amazon, Instagram, Reddit, Tik
Tok Google like so sad like there are no
more good apps being made for phones
anymore. We we've fallen we have fallen
and it's all sad but I'm so glad to see
him re-review phones uh with the audio
quality. you know, it's it's tr truly a
sign of strength and greatness that that
he did that. You know, it's it's it's
amazing. You know, he's bringing it
back. He's bringing it back. You know,
that that's amazing. That's great. You
know, more people to do this like PC Mag
and unfortunately PC Mag even though we
did do that whole, you know, cancel the
Verge thing back in 2022 because, you
know, The Verge was, you know, a
terrible outlet that like promotes
abortion and stuff and it's like a tech
magazine. So, uh good uh yeah, good
times. Uhhuh. So, uh make sure you guys
cancel them as well. Don't don't read
them. Um,
nonetheless, PC Mag, even though they
stopped
uh pubing publishing the magazine in
2022, it used to be digital only from
2008 to 2022. You know, they should
probably bring it back. You know, we
need more tech magazines uh around,
right? I mean, like what what what
exactly you expect me to read? Why do
you think I'm, you know, arguing and
yelling at people all that? Because it's
like nothing out here for people to
read. You know, back to the video.
So, right now I'm calling Disha on the
Google Pixel. Dish, how clear or unclear
would you say I sound to you? It's okay.
It does the job. I'd say I can hear you.
To me, that app kind of looks kind of
like bland. It's like just white and
red. Your voice is actually peeking a
little bit. It's cracking at the high
end. Got a bit of a walkie-talkie vibe.
I think 6.5. I'm interested to see if
that changes. See, I'm going to call you
from the iPhone now. Okay. Over.
Hello. Okay. Okay. That's why you say
hello. Kind of like the, you know, hello
Moto, which just like the person who
says hello Moto. I don't know. It sounds
like hello. The Hello Moto
person. Uh, it's like a sound startup.
Let me see if I can find the sound. It
sounds like they got like an Asian woman
maybe from like Japan who like natively
speaks Japanese and then she learned
English, but they told her to say hello
like uh from Dutch. So, this kind of
sounds like she's using three different
languages when you open uh the when you
open the phone. Let me see if I can find
uh the audio from
it. Yep, here it is. Oh, wait. No, no,
no. Now, in this one, she sounds like I
mean, it kind of makes sense like isn't
like like lots of at least like like
Hispanic kind
of here. Here's the Hello Moto theme
song. Tell me what what you guys think.
Hello Moto.
What do you think like the prompt was
for to say it? Like what what do you
guys think that was
anyway? Ely clearer. Yeah, way clearer.
If Pixel was a 6.5, this is an eight.
Yeah. Bear in mind as well, both phones
have the same that he uh he he prompted
the score there. Like he let her give
the score, you know, 6.5, eight. Um,
this kind of reminds me of that time and
we kind of like with the, you know, the
two whiz photos application, you know,
went around sort of like ranking people
like 7.2. Well, actually, I didn't go
around ranking people, but you know,
other people went around ranking people
with the app that I brought to the
school. However, the girls did get their
phone because I did give them a headset.
they could talk into a phone. So, you
know, it kind of evens out um though I
did bug them though one of them, not the
girls, one of the boys was a felon. So,
speaking of like, you know, it's kind of
like in in the SLTW like series and
we're going to do an entire timeline of
this. It is canonical like it actually
happened where I I went to school with
like an actual model and then also like
an actual felon.
So, you know, and and and we worked with
both of them. So,
again, just
like this school was meant to be. Uh I
think
also, you know, like one of the
characters says like, "Oh, uh is acting
like I say like in in in the series
like, oh, the school should be a
sitcom." And then one of the characters
like, "Yep, it should be maybe maybe I
should turn it into a TV show or like a
movie." All we need is a hundred
thunders. All right. I'll have AI write
the script for me. It's like pages and
pages of work there. It actually be kind
of interesting to see. No, no, this
would be better as a TV series. STW, but
then the book SLTW actually be good as a
movie. Now, that that would be a movie
right there. And then we can have like
the backstory of Molly and all these
people. Amazing. Amazing.
uh in they're connected to the same
Wi-Fi network, but still like a large
difference in both how I sound and how
the other person sounds. I'd go for nine
points. Pixel isn't bad, but it's it's
pretty middle of the line. It's kind of
bad cuz like it's a phone. It's what
it's supposed to do. When's the last
time you guys made a phone
call?
I ah we interrupt this section of the
tech boy media's kind of sort of tech
podcast to bring
you
redeem. Who says this? Oh, this is
almost as bad as
Jack. What was this
guy?
What? What is
this? Who just like does
he just y comes to his brain? He's
like, and I quote, "You should only be
allowed to change denominations once a
lifetime. Denomination hopping is
spiritual
culture." Literally, Ashley hard as
hit. What? Why do these people Okay,
back to the Ledge Tech podcast for you
know just
like this is what I said like in my
entire message like two two maybe three
weeks
ago Christians be normal for once but
lovable is good be normal don't be
nabbing on here like hey guys Christians
shouldn't write hymns cuz yada yada yada
Christie says it's top tier engagement
forming oh speaking of you know some
engagement form over in like India
Pakistan got this it's not even
engagement form I think he genuinely
believes this like
why why write this
who and people think I have insane takes
I'm crazy but
I this guy's He's he's setting himself
up so that he can become Catholic and be
like I switched over once. Like I can't
wait for redeem Zuma 2030. Okay. Just
just what is this? These people the
stuff I put up with on this. Okay.
Anyway, back to
um back to things like you know um you
know I I often like to look up what cuz
this is what I do like just like lead
whatever that is. I like to look up
what, you know, actual teens are doing
on, you know, well, I like to get thing,
you know, one one good thing that, you
know, I wish I could invent be a decent
friend making app because like whiz is
just where is trash. Okay, unless you're
a girl apparently. Whiz is
like garbage and it's like a monopoly.
So, you know what? What's his name? I am
what? Nonetheless, we we'll let find out
what the insult was. Well, anyway,
uh like Whiz is awful. Okay, it is the
worst app ever made and it's like
Monopoly. So, could someone call the DOJ
and tell them, "Hey guys, there's a
monopoly over here. Get away from
Google. Get away from Microsoft. There's
a there's a thing." Anyway, I like to go
read like whatever the normal kids are
doing over on like Red Core. Like they
go sneak out and like steal cars or
something. So it's either that you know
I read redeem Zuma tweets tweets and
argue with people online. So uh yep that
that's what the internet came came from.
Imagine being the person who invented
the internet 1969. You know, you create
arnet to like save the world from
nuclear annihilation and then like 50
years later, you know, you have people
with like takes
like this like just I mean just whoever
invented probably just like died
of just just died. Okay, just like no.
Okay, I can't believe I invented the
internet and you people just said yep,
this is what we're going to do with it.
Anyway, back back to the video.
So, both phones are still quite closely
tied. And the thing that you have to
give to both Google and Apple is that
they're more affordable phones. Both use
the same chipsets. I mean, which is good
because like listen here, listen closely
here. Let's see what the people in the
chat are saying. Nothing. Okay, let's
see. Let's see. Uh, anyway, let's see
what what what do you guys do with your
phones and let's see what he's saying
here. Also, look, let's look at this
home screen. even though it isn't like
1440p. I mean 14 144p. And we got uh you
know the messaging applications. We got
photos. We got Apple News, Apple Maps,
all those Apple apps. Then we got just
like Google Chrome, Google Messages,
Google phone, Google camera, which is Gc
Cam. Yep. So um who we accidentally
named the protagonists of the STW series
after a camera app but you know one day
when the series is popular and people
actually read it Gcam will rise again
and it will rise above the official
application. So yeah, I mean there used
to be MKG- GCA which was just like no,
we imagine the entire book just we just
replace G cam or G cam plus G cams with
MK that's GCA which is just
no they're higherend phones the Tensor
G4 and the A18. It's one of those things
where because both companies have their
own custom chips made specifically for
their flagship. Yeah, I forgot they do
have custom chips, which is just
basically a Samsung chip uh for the
Pixel chips. Then it's actually cheaper
for them to just reuse those chips in
their more affordable phones than it
would be to create some sort of separate
manufacturing branch just to
specifically make weaker chips. Now,
there is one slight catch with the
iPhone. See, when you're manufacturing
chipsets, you don't always get a perfect
result. Some makes sense. Also, speaking
of, we have 21 people listening right
now. So, you know, this is probably the
only time I'll be able to talk to 21
people all at once right now. So, guys,
make sure you go check out the Truth to
Tech War channel. The new one has like a
T and it's like American flag coded. So,
red, right, and blue. So, guys, go check
out that channel as well. All right,
back to the
video. Sometimes one of your cores isn't
performing up to scratch. And so, what
Apple does in these instances is
something called binning. And I don't
mean just, you know, throwing it in the
trash. It's kind of the opposite.
They'll manufacture the top end chipsets
first and in doing so they will just
naturally find a bunch that have at
least one defective core, but then
instead of just, you know, eating the
chips entirely, they'll instead just
purposefully disable those funky cores
completely and then use what the
programming uh looks like for that and
like like how do you disable the core?
What's left of the chip for their non-
flagship phones. So, while it sounds
like you get the same A18 chip on the
16e that you would actually get in the
more expensive iPhone 16, it actually
has just four graphics cores in as much
instead of the normal five. As much as I
hate this phone and you know this is the
new popular phone nowadays, you have
like Isabella Maria Duka with this phone
in pink, you know, taking it which the
only time I criticized her was for that.
Um cuz like she went from iPhone 13 Pro
X, I believe, you know, three cameras to
iPhone 16 with two cameras. So, you
know, that that is deserving of
criticism. Uh you
know, especially since she's like a
video greeter, you know, Peach Gate,
Kategate, etc.
Uh like as much as I hate this
phone, why and who was going to notice
the extra core emission? Oh guys, was I
was I was I messaging my friend and it
was kind of laggy. Oh, speaking of
iMessage, this is video. We have to see.
Yes, videos. Uh, let me see if I can
pull it up on my bookmark cuz like like
you know the you know full world people
use this phone are going to be like I'm
messaging tick tocking but like no one's
going to care
like at all like no. Okay, they're not
really going to care about the
specifications here. I have a video that
we're going to be playing. Let's see if
I can make sure it's muted. Make sure
it's not like copyrighted music or
anything. Okay, good. It's muted. It's a
video from I don't know who it's from.
Fine. I'm going to go to like the
original
source. Okay. I'm going to ask you guys
if you think if what do you guys think?
Like do you think these people would
care about the phone? And secondly, do
you think like the the phone as in like
do you think they'll care about like the
one missing core? And do you think also
uh like in a ballpark estimate, what do
you think the snap score is? All right,
so guys, what do you
think? Okay, there we go. What do What
do you guys think the snap score is? And
also like how many cores do you need to
run Snapchat? Also, what on earth does
this
video? Like what
what who posted this? And I gave it to
you. Actually, let's do a little uh
let's do a little
uh Don't let you zoom
in. Okay. I always like to play this
game called like uh where you go look at
people's phones and you see if it's new.
So, it's uh let's see how many iPhone
16s and 16 uh pluses we can find here,
guys. Uh 16 we can find here. Oh, it
looks like an
iPhone
like 11.
What the What happened to you? What were
they taping these things on? Okay. Um
Why is the flash
on? But okay. Oh. Oh, guys, it looks
like we
got Was that That is
a iPhone 12. Got another iPhone 12.
These people I still bored. I can't
afford a new iPhone. That's sad. Um
Okay.
What the What is this
video? How many? All right, there we go.
Let's go. Oh, there we go. There we go.
This is This is high quality now. What
is she looking at? She looks like uh
what what's her name? From Madden
President uh that NYU girl or whatever.
But do they all have iPhone 12s? Cuz
they all have either they all have
iPhone 16s, which I'm just going to go
with. I want to say all these iPhone 16s
cuz I I I really doubt that all these
people here have, you know, like iPhone
12s, like the entire the entire I don't
even know what this is. The entire
like cabal of
uh people I don't know what this is, but
like yeah guys, we all decided that the
national phone is the iPhone 6 uh is the
iPhone 12. That doesn't make sense.
Another thing that doesn't make sense,
what do you guys think? What do you
think is higher? 35 trillion which is be
be about the national debt or the snap
score which is apparently the amount of
times you snap and apparently people
like them have high snap scores. I I
wouldn't know but apparently it's it's
true. Well, it was in a meme so it has
to be true. All right. Anyway, back back
to the video. Also, you know, iPhone
like well you guys think these people
going to be like, "Oh no, my Snap Score
is missing a score. Oh no, I won't be
able to do the same builds I've been
able to do on the iPhone 6S since 2014.
Oh no, that's terrible." like you know
you know full well that video been
exactly the same thing like that's who
this phone is for anyway and it's for
like children and like them. Okay, the
16E is for children, the 16 regulars for
them and like 20-year-old woman who want
a pink phone or something like that. Uh
yeah. So what I mean the iPhone 16 kind
of has like that little glossy 16 just
has kind of like that little glossy
thing and they have like the little
fingernails and
like my fingernails aren't long enough
like hey guys I'm going to be I'm
messaging my friend. Oh guys look my
boyfriend I'm going to take a picture on
Instagram is the only improvement there.
No one's going to be missing the course.
Okay I guarantee they're not missing the
cores. Besides it looks like they
already did their like abs cores
workout. That's the only cores uh that
they care about. All right, back to the
missing uh the case of the missing cores
that no one cares about. But then on the
other hand, Apple's A18 is so much more
powerful than Google's. Uhhuh. Yeah.
Mhm. Yeah. He he finds like this random
game here. Like I I don't know what this
game is. Maybe it's like Ginchin Impact.
Who is popular or something? Who's
playing these games? Like the You guys
go look at the top 100 games. In fact,
this week we played like this game
called offline games, right? It was the
top 12 game in the Play Store. The thing
was so glitchy. It took me 36 minutes to
complete all the levels in that game.
And it was not a hard game. It's a game
I've been playing every day of my life
since like I've been four. It's called
Plug the Thing Into the Wall. Hey guys,
look. We have a chargery. Plug it into
the wall. That was a game. Yes, people
that bored. And that's sad. And
apparently, yeah, four of y'all were
that bored that you watched me play
something plugging into a wall, which um
I'm thankful to the loyal fans I have
out there. But good grief. You you guys
don't have to numb your brain like that.
Pensor to begin with that even with this
slight nerf, the iPhone does completely
destroy Google in real world gaming
environments. Real world gaming
environments. Mhm. Yep. That that's what
these people are going to be ignoring
with said phone. In fact, the iPhone E
would be more popular than this phone
only because it's an iPhone and like I I
message my friends which like you guys
never even use iMessage anyway. You just
use Snapchat. That's how you have a 36
trillion SNAP score
combined. Which I wonder what the IQ in
that room was. Statistically, according
it has to be statistically true. I mean,
I haven't seen it play out in my life.
Let's see. Uh,
blonde
20
woman
IQ 100. How the heck can you have an
average IQ of 100? That's decent, I
guess.
That's okay. How How old am I? Like 20.
Wait,
hold your eye
drops. 10
points from 108 to
99. And then it's kind of like rebuffs.
Yeah, maybe we should let 16-year-olds
vote and not 25y olds.
Um, let's see. Blonde average
IQ isn't like
108. Yeah, I read that it was smarter.
Oh, the average IQ in that room times
like I don't know how many people in
there.
100. Blondhaired white women have
a mean
IQ of
103.2. Interesting. So that's uh 4.2 two
points above the average.
So, do with that what you
will. I've never taken a real IQ test.
I've taken like one, but then
it made me pay. I wasn't going to pay
them, but it told me I was like in the
16th or 86th something percentile. I put
that into the chat GPT and it came out
to like
117. So, go with whatever that is. uh
which would make me
like 12 points above average apparently
cuz your IQ just drops when you turn
when you turn um 20. He's just like,
"Oh, yeah. My IQ is dead." Which is uh
bad news for people, you know. Uh maybe
they shouldn't be allowed to vote. You
know, I I could be Yeah. Okay. Just just
just don't. Okay. I wouldn't let
16-year-olds vote, too. I mean, if y'all
couldn't vote for me twice, that's No.
Uh not happening. I mean, you asked me
about abortion policy in in high school.
So, you know, y'all don't deserve to
vote in an actual election at all. I'll
take the fall. I'll take the fall.
We're talking like a 40% plus lead. So,
six points to Pixel, nine points to the
iPhone for the great and impressive
apps, gaming apps you're going to be
playing on either of these phones. No
one. No one. Well, maybe people buy it.
No one's buying the iPhone SE for gaming
like at all. At all. No one's buying it.
Fair. When it comes to software though,
we're at the stage now where it's not
like either Android nor iOS is
particularly missing any of the key
features. Yeah, you know, iOS needs to
miss more features. I like iOS, you
should probably tail them like for like
100 thousand%. Let's just ban it. Why
Why does iOS even exist? Just like
scorch it and send it to Mars. They can
both basically do everything. But what I
would say is cool is that what you're
getting on these two mid-range phones is
still the best versions of those
softwares. Like Google's promised seven
years of Android updates to this phone
and Apple's promised five for their
phone just like they do on their
flagships and they do
usually end up delivering more than
that. Google Pixel phones are completely
free from bloatware. Same goes for the
iPhone. This is the definitive Android
experience with pretty much every Yeah,
but you know stock Android I'm actually
not that big of a fan of stock Android.
Like I've gone hands on if there has
like more appro thing. I'm more of a fan
of Samsung Android. Samsung it's top
two. It's the best
software feature still intact from the
flagship Google Pixel 9. You get all the
Gemini smart assistant stuff.
Complexity, which is now a lot cleverer
than it used to be. It feels kind of
crazy to have this power at the press of
a button. Now you get the editing
features like add me to that's actually
good use. I haven't used it, but it's
actually seems useful to take two group
shots and combine the results so
everyone makes the cut and so people
don't like run off and steal your phone,
which is, you know, why you know the
selfie stick was a minute back in the
80s, you know, for cameras. This person
in Venu, someone stole his camera, he
has to take the picture of so a selfie
stick. Fun fact, a really rather
impressive magic editor that lets you
erase things but also completely change
up existing shots that you've already
taken. And then on the other hand, this
is the definitive iOS experience with
not really any software feature missing
that the top-end phones have. Unless you
count dynamic island and camera control,
but as software features, I'd consider
those highly optional. Now, that said,
well, they're more like hardware
features if you think about like dynamic
island is just a hole in the screen,
which is, you know, you could emulate
that on an Android phone. You can't do
that on iPhone and camera controls
complete hardware. It'd be kind of
interesting to see if someone can get
that to work on Android phone. The only
way I can think is like maybe use the
button, push this, push that, change
some settings.
But I actually personally think right
now that Android just generally as a
platform is in a better place than
iOS's. You know, there's way more AI
features, better AI. Um, you know, Apple
intelligence is just stupid. Apple's AI
is floundering. It feels like it's
getting more stable, which I can't say
for iOS. and some of iOS's recent design
changes like the photos gallery. I just
find them baffling. So, personally, I
would say for software, oh, gets a nine.
iPhone gets a seven. And you used to
take the points off. It runs iOS.
You're sitting there wondering now,
well, Aaron, you just gave Android more
points than iOS, but your main phone is
still an iPhone. Make it make sense.
Well, that's where the next category
comes in. Because where I think Apple
pulls ahead is ecosystem. ecosystem is
something like like it's all the same
thing. Why would you buy an iPad if you
have an iPhone? Seriously, why? Unless
you unless you uh don't have a laptop,
then fine. But like if you have a
MacBook and you have an iPhone, why do
you have a tablet? Are you like using as
a teleprompter or something? All you
need to take notes. Use your phone. Use
your phone. Okay? You can take notes on
your phone or or just use the laptop.
And like you know the people who use
MacBooks are using them for all the same
things. I was seeing watching this movie
like it's called like the click or
something from like 2009 but no from
2008. It's actually pretty interesting
because you know they have the iPhone
but most of the girls in the movie have
like just the regular old style cell
phones except for one who's like the
richest of them or something. She has
like the original iPhone. I think might
be iPhone like three depending on when
it was shot or whatever. But then she's
also has this Mac and they have this
interesting like I guess prei message
chat thing that's on the Mac. They also
do like some video calling right there
on the Mac as well like which which you
know makes sense. you know, it's
high-tech back in the and she has like a
little state of the state of the school,
state of the union thing, which makes
sense, you know. Uh uh
oh. Um and it's just like, you know,
they're using chat programs. She's using
all things like this, but you know, all
that's been, you know, now ported over
to iPhones, right? Like why do you even
have a Mac? Why does anyone even have a
computer now? Like what what programs
are you going to use, people? Look at
the tabs I have open. Blogspot. Okay, we
got phone thing. Uh, Grock can't be done
on the phone. We got uh Instagram again,
phone thing. Then some random websites,
phone thing. We look down here. We just
have like some random terrible 3D app.
We have uh PowerPoint phone thing. My
antivirus. And then some browsers and in
C. I guess that's not a phone thing. And
then Whoa. Like just why do these things
even exist anymore? Like just just use
your phone. What?
Most of you are likely already in and
fairly locked into either the Apple or
the Android ecosystem. Well, I mean, I
just have a laptop on a phone, but yeah,
but if you assume for a minute that you
were neutral, you were deciding between
these two phones and were completely
open to fully adopting all of the
products built around whichever one of
these two you pick, then why would you
buy that? Like, if you if you're
planning on buying a MacBook, you're
planning on buying an expensive iPad,
why would you buy this? Just buy like an
older iPhone 15, like just it doesn't
even make sense.
then I think Apple wins by a landslide.
Firstly, because even on their own,
Apple's ecosystem products are largely
class leading. Like the iPad, for
example, completely destroys Google's
Pixel tablet, which at this point, I
mean, shook, but like the iPad he's
showing is like I think it cost him
$3,200. Like, no one with that iPad is
going to buy this phone. I hope. Quite
dated and very underpowered. Apple TV is
from my experience a better TV box than
the Google TV streamer. I mean maybe,
but
like just I mean I mean we're fine with
our TV's web OS. I mean like you push
button on the remote to get Netflix,
then you push switch away to get Direct
TV. All right, you're done. Like it's
not that hard. It's not like we're
playing Angry Birds on the TV or
Minecraft or something.
It feels more premium to use and it just
like never lags. Watches and earphones
are a little more debatable because
while I do think the Apple Watch and the
AirPods are great, I also think the
Pixel Watch 3 is by far the best watch
Google has ever made. And the PixelBuds
Pro 2 as well feel topof the line. But
then again, I think the MacBook is the
best consumer grade laptop you can buy.
Yeah. Yeah. You got some video editing,
you got some writing, and yeah, that's
it. Like, you know, computing. It just
seems more interesting. Now, maybe this
is from Advention Odyssey. Back in the
90s, you can just like dial into random
people's computers. Well, speaking of, I
did a Croc chat. No, Perplexity chat
about why dialing programs. I need to go
ask about that thing as
well, unless you're a gamer or you need
like a specific app that only works on
Windows. And I don't even think it's a
competition compared to like a Google
made Chromebook. Now, bear in mind the
upside with Android is that you don't
need to specifically buy in-house Google
made stuff. You could buy a Samsung
tablet and a Dell laptop. But then the
downside is that the integration you get
isn't as deep. It's fine. I mean, I
personally don't sync my text messages
with my PC cuz if someone were to get my
password to the PC or my phone, vice
versa, they wouldn't be able to have
access to everything.
Plus, those products, they're not
designed completely around each other
like Apples are. There's a second part
to this ecosystem equation too that
iPhones generally integrate slightly
smoother into the wider world. Like
you'll just have an easier time doing
stuff. Like for example, Apple's Face
ID. It's not just for logging into your
phone. You can also use it to like
authenticate bank transactions within
Can't you do it with your fingerprint
scanner? Third party banking apps much
more so than you can with Google Pixel's
fingerprint scanner, for example. you'll
have more variety when it comes to
accessories and cases because it is far
easier for a company to design something
around one of the five or so iPhones
released in a year versus the thousand
Android devices. Well, yeah, but this is
a Pixel, okay? It's not like some random
phone from Xiaomi or something. And I'm
pretty sure there's some pretty good
Pixel 9a cases out there. It's also just
that there's a lot of developers who
specifically prioritize a smooth app
experience for iPhone users. Also, like
again, this whole thing with developers
and apps. What apps? Please tell me.
I've been begging begging for
weeks use on stream like what
apps? What? What
apps? Yeah, I don't want to hear you.
It's a web portal. I don't
know over Android users. Even like the
leisure center that I used to go to, if
you had an iPhone, you could install
your membership card digitally. It would
show up automatically on your Apple
Watch. So easy. Whereas if you had an
Android, well, you just still had to
carry around a physical card like you
were in the previous era. Or like our
gym equipment in this house, it syncs
perfectly with Apple Health. Could not
get it to work with Android. So, it's
this kind of stuff that has meant that
even though I do think that Android in
isolation is a better software platform
right now, I've still personally decided
to use an iPhone. So, I've got Pixel 8
points, iPhone 10 points, which does
mean Apple is starting to take the lead
here. cameras though is it's a bit of a
sorry case on both phones to be honest
because I mean like the Pixel 9a for
example actually seems to have had a
camera downgrade from the 8. The main
camera makes sense cuz it's been you can
see the camera bar
here. What what happened? What did you
do? It was a smaller sensor and it's 48
megapixels compared to the 64 that we
got last time around. I'm assuming
they've had to do this to be able to
create this nearly flat design but it's
not a great look prior. But why? like
it's not like
prioritizing form over function, but
even then Google's actually looking
pretty great compared to Apple who's
literally just given you a 48 megapixel
main camera and no ultra wide. It
actually feels really strange using a
phone without one because of how
fundamental of a feature ultra wide has
become these days. Actually,
I mean, and
yeah, I mean, Apple does have this, and
I think I've said this on stream before,
like it keeps kids from sticking the
phone in their mouth and taking pictures
of their tongues.
So, I mean, congrats, but
also you still have that feature.
Disgraceful
for a $600 device. As for how good the
main cameras are, they're both fine. A
picture's a picture to me. Like, they're
mid-range phones and they feel like
mid-range phones. They take I'm not
going to compare photos because, you
know, streams in like two bits. So like
very similar quality shots with two just
slightly different styles. They're both
fairly fast to capture. The 9A just
looks brighter. They have reliable
autofocus, but then equally they both
Oof. That is
completely suck when it comes to zooming
in like this. I know it doesn't suck
this bad, but I mean
still can barely What is that? It was
taken at eight time zoom, but when you
look at the quality, you might have
thought it was 80. And then of course
the iPhone's video is a little bit
cleaner, especially since one of the few
Google Pixel features that this more
affordable A series phone does miss out
on is video boost, which would have
helped. So I'd say the iPhone's main
camera, I wonder if there's a way you
can spoof it, like trick Google into
think it's like a 8 or Pixel 9
is very slightly better than the Pixel's
main camera. But then the Pixel has a
large advantage having this whole extra
second camera. And then for selfies, I
absolutely love that the Pixel can go
ultra wide for group shots, but also
just selfies that capture your
surroundings. But then I absolutely hate
the fact that it doesn't have autofocus.
So unless you hold your hand out and
specifically go wide, your face will
actually be very slightly out of focus.
Both phones do also have optical image
stabilization, but if you want the
proper action camera experience, then I
have never used a better one than the
Insta 360 Ace Pro 2, our sponsor. Up
until now, you hear action camera, you
think GoPro, right? Here we go. Let's
go. And now the final pillar for these
phones is the battery. And just to give
you guys, how important is battery life
to you?
An idea. I ran a 2hour battery test
simulation. And also look at this. It's
just sad. YouTube
shorts. We we we can do so much better.
We can do so much better. being a
combination of social media scrolling,
YouTube watching, and general app use.
With the Pixel on its smooth 120 Hz
mode, and the iPhone just being an
iPhone at 60 Hz, and the Pixel finished
that test with 86% left, the iPhone had
91. Okay, that's not fair. Like, it's
not you you could set the Pixel to 60
Hz. It's not fair to I mean, if the if
the phone could fly, would you be like,
"Well, the phone has to fly at all
times.
his phone that little drone pack. No.
Now, I could have kept the Pixel on 60
Hz and gotten longer battery life, but
given that 120 Hz is one of the key
selling points, and because we've
already given this phone extra points in
the display category for having it, I
think it makes sense to also keep that
mode on for battery. No, you have to you
have to check with the same features
that it has, right? I mean, it'd be kind
of like having a telephoto zoom contest
with the S24 Ultra and the iPhone 16 and
being like,
well, you know, the iPhone
16 or I guess take it won't be like
taking a feature, right? Uh, your iPhone
16 has to zoom in, you know, like this.
But we're going to give it a nice little
like telephoto attachment. Let's have
like that. No, no, that's not fair.
battery testing and assuming you do that
dayto-day, the iPhone will consistently
last longer. But I mean, duh, if you got
it like if you have the phone, one
phone's in power saving mode essentially
because that's what you know that that's
a mode you can do on a Samsung phone
where you can have a power save and go
to 60 Hz. One phone's in power saving
mode and one's not and the phone in
power saving mode lasts longer. Wow.
Truly shocked. I'm I'm shocked here,
people.
Even the Pixel is easily enough to get
you through the day thanks to a 5,100
mAh cell on the inside. So, they both
have pretty great batteries. They both
have very underwhelming charging. As
you've seen, both phones come without a
charger, and they also have some pretty
mediocre wired charging speeds. And
while they do support wireless charging,
it's nothing particularly fast or
exciting with neither utilizing magnets
to make it any faster or more efficient,
leading to battery scores of six to
pixel and seven to iPhone.
So, that actually makes it very close in
the end. But, we do have a
winner. And it's not the iPhone cuz yes,
Apple is ahead. It's got 8% more points
overall. But when you factor in that you
have to pay 20% more to get that being
$599 instead of $499, plus the fact that
these Pixels are practically guaranteed
to be on sale in a few months, while
iPhones are like the opposite. I would
actually say Google is more likely to be
the better value overall package. And
congratulations to Google for its
impressive win over the iPhone. All
right, let's go back to the tech
boy.org. We have some more headlines
that we had to do
uh go over today. So, um how to set
specific ringtones per contact on
iPhone. Also, how to create some free on
Samsung, how to create free pie charts
as well. Check out these articles. And
now we're going to get to the fun part.
We still have an hour left of stream.
More like 45 minutes and then we have
like So you guys can go ask me
questions. Come
on. There's like 20 there's 24 of you
people here. Get in the chat and ask
questions because we have to go to the
sad and the brave site known as right
because I put in
a query here. And here you
go. Wow. for up
folks. So, we tried we're looking into
like interesting programs and we're
going to try them right here on stream.
So, essentially we're looking for fun
software that is not a chat app and not
a game because like I have no friends I
chat with and I'm not really interested
I'm not really interested in games. Um,
speaking of games, we're going to be
having a game stream like an hour after
this. So, you know, just not to anyway.
All right. They said that we can try our
hand at programming using this
application called processing. So that's
interesting. I'm not going to try to
learn how to program right now.
Okay. What does this
do? Yeah, it's one of those little open
sourced Oh, it actually teaches you how
to learn how to code. That's
interesting. All right. Uh, okay. Let's
see. Blender. We're not drawing that
right now. The thing with crash. Here's
the thing I was interested in. Soup
Toys. It's a 2D sandbox game
thingy. Oh, what? Okay. All right. Let's
go over to Let's go check into Soup
Toys. And
it's
it's What the What is
this? Okay, that's a
it. Yep. You gotta love
physics. And it's put out by the Super
Boys because of of course it was. Let's
see if this thing
works. Uh we'll bookmark that and start
the download while we go look into what
else is. And he said the Powatory The
Powator is actually pretty interesting.
It's more interesting on the phone cuz
on my computer it's like um does not
scale well at all. The screen's only 15
inches. Like, come on. I used to be able
to scale. All right, let's see what the
next program
is. Wait, that's it. Oh, there we go.
Python. Whatever. Uh, steam powered. Oh,
what's that? Better not cost money. Oh,
it's from the steam store. Flowscape.
You can create your own nature scene
simply by painting. Oh, this looks like
a bank. Uh, uh, like one of those little
book things like from like movies. This
actually looks interesting.
How much is
it?
$15. I don't have $15 to
spend, though. I could probably make
money with this. I can make some
wallpapers. Maybe they'll give it to me
for free. Right, let's bookmark that and
save
it because, you know, may maybe I can
like test it, give them a little free
shout out or review or something like
that. All right, so I'm downloading Soup
Toys right now on a totally legitimate
and legal
website. All right, now let's go to the
next thing. Research and build a family
tree. We can do that later.
Factorio. Okay, let's see what this is.
Is it It's
a He said it's like an Excel
spreadsheet. You guys see this, right?
Does this look like an Excel
spreadsheet? Okay,
that's that that's interesting. But I'm
not really sure what this has to do with
Excel with cute graphics. Uh, okay.
That's That's great. Linux. Yeah, Linux
hates me. Emacs, some text editor. What
is with these people in text editors?
Like just why you people act like text
editors of the second coming of the
Samsung Galaxy A Galaxy S1? Like what?
You you people like worship at the feet
of text editors. This is crazy. Wait,
someone actually commented, "Dude's
clearly on the
spectrum." How?
That's uh There we
go. Wonder if this is Christy's alt
account. Like she's like pretending to
be American or something. I don't know.
All right, let's uh let's go back to
YouTube and let's go back to Reddit.
View professional. You can create
landscapes for free. See, that's what
I'm talking about. Free landscapes.
People go like it's it's my right as a
citizen, right, to be able to create
landscapes for free. not not
$14.99. Uh, View Professional is a free
software that can be used to create
landscapes. Thank you. That's that's
that's great. Let me see if I can find
it because when I type it in, it's
something different.
There's a test taker view
professional professional landscape
software. I haven't found it. Look, it's
missing. Oh, here it
is. View infinite. Oh, okay. I've always
wondered what those little particle
simulation games things do. Here it is.
View six.
This looks interesting. All right, let's
uh let's download this thing for
Windows. All right, guys. You always
remember to make sure you're safe on the
internet. It's always like like the like
that down lane episode where Mr. Morris
is like, "Be safe on the internet,
guys." And he's like, "Okay, yeah, we
got it." But like you didn't even know
what a blog was until like a few days
ago, a few seconds ago. So like maybe
you should be the one to speak. But
whatever.
Oh, this guy couldn't even find it as
well as me. I think it's called V6. So,
let me let me me see if I can comment it
here for
him. And I also got a message from
someone. So, I'm going to stop sharing
so you guys can't see
messages and read out the softwares that
we were
given. All
right. Apollo in real time. Oh, okay.
What's that? Oh, it's a timeline of the
moon landing. Okay.
[Music]
Gizmo. Shut up, Alexa. All right. It's
uh It's not letting me scroll through
the chat.
Windows
Windows 635. I I can't really even read
what it's saying.
New York City. Oh, there's some
interesting on the website, too. Um,
I'll take a screenshot so you guys can
see maybe from Nice. All right, we have
40 more minutes. So, let's go find an
interesting YouTube video to react
to. Um, you guys can give some. Ooh,
Sarah Grace. That's another video. I did
a reaction to her, but
apparently
like missed out uh you you missed being
able to hear what I said, what she was
saying. So, that was sad, but I such a
good reaction that I guess you could
understand what I was saying. Uh
hopefully that's what I at least like to
think. Also, it's kind of interesting
how the
entire YouTube homepage is actually
better on my laptop than it is on my
phone, which is just like, "Hey, Chris,
look. It's not a point for me to have a
laptop, I guess, which is just like,
what are you guys doing with your
life?" Uh, let's see what my what's in
my bookmarks here.
I guess I missed the
bookmark. Oh, here it is. Here it is.
No, the T L pager entering production.
Let's go.
Uh,
this is what I'm talking about. This is
the interesting niche neat technology
that I'm talking about that I want to
see from you people. This This is what
I'm talking
about. Let's go. It's like a paging
device that uses Lovar so you can
communicate without needing Wi-Fi or
anything like that. That's amazing. And
this person gets it. Why not use an
adapter for existing smartphones and we
could have our own little Wi-Fi uh uh
walkie-talkie smartphones? It's been a
dream of mine since I've been born. It
would be great. It'd be even better than
the Babbling Book Summit of uh last
year. It would be really, really
amazing. All right, let me open up the
uh YouTube thing so we can react to
another video. Uh, let's go to Sarah
Grac's channel unless you guys in the
comments want to say
something. You can pick another video.
Nothing. No video.
Okay. So, we're going over to Sherry
Grace. Let's see what she has to say
about Ted because last time I roasted
her heart because she was just like,
"Oh, I don't know what she
say. H. Let's see what we have
here. All right, you guys. Come on. Pick
pick
something. How long is this? 21 minutes.
All right, let's do
uh let's do this
one. Let's Let's see how many This is a
$1 speaker. All right, it's a $1
speaker. Let's see what Let's see how
good the analysis is. You know, be nice
to it cuz, you know, I don't want to get
sued. Also, you know, it's kind of sort
of, you know, nice to be nice to people.
So, all right, back to the video.
[Applause]
And this is a $1,000 speaker.
Yeah, maybe you should have moved. All
right, let's go.
That's horrible. So, obviously the more
expensive product wins, but I can't
believe it. I can't believe a speaker
the size of your fingertip lost to a
speaker the size of you. Who who would
have seen this
coming? Physics is amazing. Does more
expensive always mean better? We're
about to find out today. So, this is a
$30 3D printer. 3D printer pins are
trash. Again, just ban them. Throw them
out. They are awful. And this is a $300
3D printer is obviously going to win. I
mean, look, it even has that nice little
aesthetic little, you know, gray kind of
like smoothness about to it. Okay. The
3D printer pen is not with the box. It's
printed on 3D printer on the Ankor Make
app. We are have like a ton of different
stuff we can make. Obviously, this
doesn't have an app, but there's like so
many different options, but we need
something quick because I don't want to
wait 14 hours for this to be 3D printed.
Okay, so we're trying to run up the
Ankor Make printer and get it all ready
to actually print. But 3D printers are a
disaster. They never really work that
well. So, I'm trying to get it to like
run, but it's kind of having some issues
right now. Maybe it just needs to like
warm up. I don't know what to do. It's
not working. This thing has to like
preheat and then level and then then you
have to pick the file and then you have
to upload the file and then you have to
hope that something actually comes out
of this thing. Going to take a while.
Meanwhile, why don't we try our $30 one?
This one looks a Yeah. And you know
what's going to come out of that 70°
preheated sticky plastic [ __ ] mess. A
lot easier. I always freaking wanted one
of these when I was a kid. So, I bought
it as a grown-up. Now I have money to
buy it.
He's 22 ish. These existed 10 years ago.
Isn't that crazy? I'm like a whole grown
person. Oh, look at all the colors that
this one comes with. This one was only
30 bucks. But with this 3D printer, we
only have white and blue. That's all we
got. But with this one, look at all the
colors. Oh my good. Yeah, you're going
to burn through each and every one of
those. Come on. Goodness. This is fun.
Oh shoot. I think it's wireless, too.
Isn't it? Cuz it doesn't have a wire. I
think it's wireless. Okay, so let's see
if this thing is as simple as it looks.
I'm sticking in the filament. I think it
might need to heat up a little bit.
Something's happening though for sure.
What the heck? Oh my gosh. This is
actually working. It's like
I
mean kind of. It's like a really bad hot
glue gun. And um Soup Toys is installing
right now. So, uh let's see how well it
works out for us. Melting the plastic
and it's like actually making a 3D
printer. Like a handheld one, though.
I'm trying to make a little heart
because why not? Oh, it's coming out.
Interesting accent, dude. Little heart.
Uh, very good.
Uh, yeah. All right, back to the video.
A little crazy. Oh my goodness. Wait,
this is so fun.
I mean, yeah, but the printer is going
to win. Wait, what? What is this?
And it's actually so easy to use. Like,
you literally just turn it on and start
it. Oh my goodness. Okay, so might not
have came out that
nice. That is that that's terrible. And
for our gaming stream people, that's
going to happen right after this. Let's
just keep it on up. Soup toys will be
the game cuz none of you people picked
anything. So, you're going to get stuck
with soup toys. That's what you get.
Wow, that was so easy. Like, we quite
literally just turned it on and started
freaking printing and we could like plug
in all these different colors. It looked
like ice cream. No, maybe we should make
an ice cream cone. Yeah, boy. You see
that? Change. Okay, look how bad that
is. It's just like one little filament.
Okay, now let's make the cone. The cone
is going to be freaking hard. That's
kind of good. Come on, brother. I don't
know if that looks like a ice cream
cone.
What is this? What? What is this?
But hey, at least I tried. That's pretty
darn good. That's pretty fire. No, it's
not. And you people are getting like
obsessed with like actual trash. Okay.
3D printer. Okay, so here is our 3D
printed creation on our $30 3D printer.
It's making a whole freaking cookie down
there. She's having some issues. Do you
see that? It's burning. All the filament
is just sitting there burning in like a
giant clump. It's a mess. Oh no. That's
really calibrated the printer first.
Really bad, brother. This is really
freaking bad. What's happening? This is
the $300 printer. There's no way. Right.
This is all it prints out. I literally
tried to film like print a bunch of
different stuff and I mean that's better
than an ice cream cone. Nothing was
freaking working. This is actually not
the results I expected from this. But if
you guys have ever used a 3D printer,
you know that they're insanely
complicated to use for some reason. So,
I guess this is our $30 printer creation
versus our $300 3D printer creation. I
can't believe it. Cheap won this round.
Well, that that is a take. Point to
cheap. The next one, I'm actually really
excited. This right here is a $2
flashlight. Like $1.28, right? This, my
friends, is a $200 flashlight. $200
flashlight easily wins this when you
can't mess up a flashlight, can you?
Just don't don't point it at you. It's
going to burn you up. Like, literally,
when I was looking up products for this
video, I'm like, how can a flashlight be
$200? We're about to find out right now.
There we go. Oh, wow. What the fancy? Oh
my goodness. This thing is freaking
heavy. It's like a whole weight. $2
versus $200 flashlight. But I think in
order to get an accurate test of this,
we need the lights off. Okay, so first
let's try the $1 light. Also, really
nice set. video studio here, but
like what what apps are you running
here?
Need batteries. First red flag of this
flashlight, it needed a battery. Okay,
let's try it out. Ready? $2 flashlight.
Okay, it's not bad, right? No. No.
Please don't point $200 flashlight in
your face. If you ever want to see
again, I think it's bright. Yeah. Hold
on. Which do you think's brighter? Oh,
definitely the $2. The $2 flashlight. I
think this one is just very focal. Like
it's very like one area. Okay. Not bad.
Not bad, though. This is a $2
flashlight. Let's try the $200
flashlight. If this needs a battery. Oh
my. Look at the battery. Dang. And the
$200 battery. Oh. Oh, that's not worth
it. Wait, this is so bad.
What the What is wrong with these
products? She must be using it. Well, it
has to be like a setting or something.
This There's no way. I think $5 for
flashlight is better than this. What the
heck? Hold on. Wait. Oh, it was
brighter. Oh, okay. Okay.
Bro, I I told you not to point it at
your face. Oh
my
Why? These people. These people. What
was the IQ for blackhaired girls again?
I literally almost like blinded myself.
I saw the light. I literally saw heaven.
Look.
What the hell?
I told you. Look. Look. No. The camera
can see what it looks like. This is what
it looks like when the $200 flashlight
hits you.
Oh my god. This thing is crazy, brother.
Wait, but it's not that dark. She went
from, "Wow, this flashlight is pathetic
to literally woriing at this
flashlight's feet." Like, there's a
You're going to have to proper respect
to the flashlight, but like you don't
need to be
like worshiping it. There you go. Oh,
okay. So, there's different settings.
So, there's like vocal and then
just just wow.
Just wow.
There's like big area. Okay, let's try
this again. We have the only way to test
it is on my face apparently. So, I'm
blinding myself for this video. Light
number Why? Why? Why do you do this to
yourself? Number one. Light number two.
Scared, bro. I'm freaking scared. No,
I'm scared, brother. Okay. Oh my gosh.
Is it right? Yeah. I can see I can see
the light. I'm in another world. I'm in
a dude. This is nuts. Oh, we can tell
scary story.
Just one. But
I This This is This
is What is this?
This is the story about Sarah spent all
our money in a YouTube video.
a $200 black light. Wow. Okay, so I
think we can collectively agree that the
more expensive one's better team. Wow,
that's
a
W2. Uhoh.
Expensive wins. Next up, we have our $8
pair of headphones and our vocal. So,
these were $8. All right. Um, if the
expensive headphones don't win, that's
gonna be uh that's gonna be And this was
929.
Okay, that's not even fair. Like these
things that
I know. For some freaking headphones is
crazy, dude. These come in a whole
freaking Okay, sir. There's a little
extra. And then over here, the packaging
for the $8 headphones. Little sandwich
baggie. Wow. Dude, this is literally
taking me to freaking when I was in
elementary school playing cool math
games on the freaking computer. Fun
brain.
Papropica. Oh my god. See, this gives
you nostalgia. This What? What is this
giving us? It's not giving us anything.
A purse. It's going to give you base. It
is a purse, isn't it? It's my Gucci
leon. Oh my gosh. What did I spend $900
on? It comes with like all of these
freaking wires, which is crazy to me
because nobody really I feel like What
do you use this for? Yeah. I feel like
this is like some high quality like
studio headphones. Yeah, for sure. Okay,
so first we're going to try out our $8
headphones. Wow.
[Music]
Honestly, I'm very very surprised with
these. I thought that it was going to
sound super quiet and muffled, but you
could actually hear pretty well for like
$8 and like completely out of plastic.
Like these are not too shabby. H
interesting. You know that that's that's
nice. I have to say the problem is now
these have to compete with $8 headphones
and they have to blow my mind. Like when
I hear this music I mean a flashlight
that that also you know hopefully she's
using high resolution you know audio
files because like it's just like some
random compressed YouTube video. It's
going to sound a bit better but not like
900 times better. I better hear the
person that was coughing in the studio
in the very back. Like I need to hear
every single sound. This is make or
break it right now. Oh my god, you have
to plug it in on both sides. That's kind
of intense. I feel like I need to listen
to something like really good. What's
like has good sound? Honestly, these
don't feel that like Did you just listen
to this off of YouTube? You know, if I
was an audio file, like go
like yell at it in the comments, but I'm
not. So, good quality. Like the AirPod
Maxes, like I can kind of get on board
with it. Like they feel heavy and good
quality. These are kind of like
plasticky. They don't feel crazy good.
Time to put them to the test. Studio
level music.
What is she listening to? What if of all
the songs she chose? She
chose whatever that was.
I think I'm going to cry. This sounds
amazing. I'm not going to lie to you.
Uh Mhm. So, uh we we may have different
definitions of music.
It's enough to make a grown girl cry.
Unpopular. You're like 20. How old are
you?
She
is
21.
So yeah,
that's okay. Opinion, these are great.
Not that good. Not actually that good. I
sw Oh my gosh, he didn't download the
click files. He downloaded some random
YouTube thing.
And yeah,
swear to you, AirPod Max sounds better.
Like it just sounds a little bit
muffled. Like it does not sound that
great. Is it as bad as these? Absolutely
not. But for
$900, I expected better. I expected to
really hear crispy good audio. Team
Chief wins. Is that crazy? That's crazy
to say. That's crazy to say, right? Cuz
it's the price. You know, that's a take.
All right, we got a projector.
Obviously, the cheap projector is going
to lose here. And it's just simple
physics. You can't compete with the
physics. $40 projector. And this is a
$1,000 projector. Bigger. It's going to
have a bigger light. And you know, she
likes to point lights towards her face.
and we're about to see how big of a
difference this makes. So, first off, we
have the LED projector. This is not
going to do better than like 10, so
that's already like not. But you know
what? I'm talking about price compared
to my name and the simplicity of it. Oh,
shoot. This is even smaller than I
thought. Oh my gosh, look at this. It's
like a little Kodak Insta camera. So
tiny. And it's like entirely plastic, so
it doesn't feel super great quality. Oh
man. See, this is the kind of stuff I
don't like when you have Oh man, you got
tech from 2006. like plug in 20 million
things to it. Like I kind of just want
to plug and play. Over here on the
Nebula Anchor side, we've actually used
this in a couple videos. They're not
sponsoring today, but I do love this
projector. Oh my gosh, the size
difference is crazy. And it comes with a
handy dandy remote. If you just used it,
why did you buy it? Right off the bat,
the $60 projector was insanely used 40.
What happened? Inflation. Complicated
setup. You have to connect HDMI and then
I had to connect the HDMI to adapter and
then into my computer. And that just
kind of mirrors the Netflix that I'm
putting on my computer. But our anchor
projector, we literally just plugged it
in and it has Netflix, YouTube,
everything built in. Oh, so it's like a
TV already. So, we literally just
plugged it in and turned it on. But then
again, like why just buy a TV? A TV
would be actually cheaper than this. You
can get a TV at 20 $200 at Walmart. It's
actually crazy. And let's not even talk
about this freaking difference in the
quality. Like,
she learned something that day. It's
kind of hard to tell on camera, but the
$1,000 projector, not that hard to tell.
This one's brighter. Is crispy. Like
crispy, clear, bright. Like, it's
amazing. Like, it looks better than my
TV. And then on our $60 projector, it is
not good at all. Like, it's gray. It's
blurry. It's just not good. I mean, you
can still see the picture. So, that's
cool. Like, you can still see like
what's on the screen, but it's just kind
of like nothing compared to the other
projector. Okay, so the $60 projector,
no sound is coming out of it for some
reason. Maybe we have to hook up
probably put the, you know, with the
little dongle and adapter. It's probably
broken that way. Like a speaker or
something, but it's not playing any
music, which is very unfortunate. But
this projector on the other
hand, it's a little too loud.
Oh my god.
Speakers on the $1,000 projector are
absolutely insane. So loud, so clear.
This doesn't have a speaker,
unfortunately. Obviously, this one's a
lot cheaper, so it's not a complete fair
comparison, but in the battle between
That's the point of the video. Of
course, it's not fair. Give it to the
big one. Cheap versus expensive.
Expensive wins this round 100%. Yes, it
is expensive, but it's 100% worth it.
And the picture quality is insane. So,
sorry, cheap, expensive wins. The next
item is kind of crazy, but this is a 98
cent pen, and this is a $100 pen. The
cheap pen is going to win. A pen is a
pen. Yeah, you heard that right. I spent
$100 on a pen. Like and subscribe,
please. Okay, I think let's start with
the cheap pen because everybody knows
what a freaking pen looks like. 98 cents
on Amazon. Love to see it. Packaging not
very classy. Okay, so here is our paper
and I'm just going to write hello on it.
Wow, very nice. This over here is our
vase with Indian lotus scrolls. I don't
care. It's a A pen is a pin. Okay.
In gold tracing. Okay. Super fancy box.
Oh my gosh, dude. Look at this. It has a
freaking letter with a seal print on it.
This is gorgeous. Let me guess what the
letter says. It's going to say talking
about the beauty of handwriting, yada
yada yada. Where this pen was made from,
yada yada yada. We hope you enjoy it.
yada yada yada. And we hope that your
creative imagination sparks blah blah
blah. Want to get this now just cuz I
love this. Oh my goodness, this is so
pretty. Okay. And then it comes with a
little letter to those on the journey of
pursuing mastery. Wow. See? Told you one
of those
little type thingies. I am being sold
right now. Okay. And then inside also
there's instructions for a pen. That is
wild. Okay. So then also in here, what
the heck is this? Okay. Here is the pen.
If I could ever get it out. Here she is.
Very, very interesting. It's quite heavy
actually. Wow. Look at that. I mean, she
is cute. She's in cute indeed. It has
like these really intricate designs on
it. Very pretty. Very cute.
It looks like you could like signal a
plane with it or like, you know, spike
someone in the head with it. The actual
pen. Oh, okay. Interesting. So, this is
like the base that you have on your
desk, I guess, for your fancy $100 pen.
And then let's go ahead and test out. It
doesn't even take pictures. It's not
even a spy pen. Like, a pen is a pen.
Well, this thing actually writes because
for $100, this thing better freaking do
my homework for me, too. Okay. Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Okay. Look at this. First of
all, this one looks way better.
Obviously, it was a lot easier to write
as well. I will say like this one write
on top of a book. That's what I do. Was
like a lot harder to write. So, like
let's just say I'm writing my name
Sarah. Like I have to apply a good
amount of pressure and it's barely
coming out. You have to apply 100 times
less pressure. It's a dollar pen versus
a $100 pen. This one I'm like very
lightly using it. It very like slow like
softly smoothly writes. Like it's very
smooth to write with. I'm not going to
lie. What was that? What was that
transition? Freaking like this pen. It
like it works so good. Like I'm barely
writing and it's just coming off so
beautifully. And then this one I kind of
have to like if I'm barely writing it
comes out like that. Like that is crazy
the difference. Is it worth it?
Absolutely freaking not. You really
thought you ate brother? I feel like
this is if you're like There we go.
There we go. That That's There we go.
Same s right there. You think you ate,
brother? You know, look, I I'll take it.
I'll take it. Gen Z for the win. A pen
is a pin, people. A pin is a pin. Uh you
know, congratulations Grace.
million-dollar deals, you know, and
you're like, if you're like signing a
million dollar deal and I'm like a boss
babe on my desk and I'm like, shall we
finalize this deal? The founding fathers
were using this to freaking write
stupid. The next thing we're comparing
is smart watches. So, this right here is
the cheapest smartwatch I could find on
Amazon for $12. And this is Yeah, things
losing. Well, I don't know the way this
video is going. The Apple Watch Ultra
that cost 730 bucks. Absolutely crazy
difference here. This one's just
obviously normal plastic wrap. Nothing
fun and fancy. the entire thing. All
right, so here is our Apple Watch Ultra.
It has like a camouflage watch band and
it's just freaking funny. Like it's
trying to like be orange and like Apple
Watch Ultra vibe, but it's giving Dollar
Tree. And then over here we have our
freaking I had to sell my left kidney
for this. Bougie packaging. Bougie,
bougie, bougie, bougie. And then bougie,
bougie, bougie. Right here is our Apple
Watch Ultra 2. Dang, this thing is huge.
And then our watch bands. Oh, what the I
thought I ordered a nicer one, but I
guess we have this like olive green.
Obviously, the packaging on the more
expensive stuff is just always more
excessive, which is kind of crazy cuz
like why are we wasting more materials
versus just Hey, hey, look. Look, you
paid $700 for it. I want the whole tree.
Okay. No, none of this environmentalism.
Getting straight to the point. I guess
the like more expensive stuff tries to
make it more of like an experience,
which honestly it works. Like Apple
products are Apple products because of
the experience. Okay, so here is our
$700 versus our $12 watch. And they look
pretty similar. They both have like very
Well, I mean, a watch is a watch. You
can A square is a square. I mean, how
would you mess up a square? Very like
digital uh technology looking homepages
and they're pretty
What did I do to this digital technology
looking? What do you expect them to look
like? Also, you know, I think it's
interesting that for $12, you can get a
functional touchcreen. You know, for
$1,000 a few years ago, touchcreens were
rare, you know. Cool. And they both have
buttons on the side. So, obviously the
Apple Watch, you click it and you have
like a ton of different apps. You can
also notice how she's wearing an Apple
Watch on her wrist. Text messages on
here. You can listen to music on here
versus our $12 watch. You can do
running, walking, cycling. It's
definitely can't do as much as this
watch. And of course, a $12 watch is not
going to be as great. It's probably not
going to be as responsive. And there's
20 million things that you can do on the
expensive watch. You can track your
blood pressure. You can make calls on
it. You got a calendar. But with this
one, you can literally just work out,
which I mean, I guess that's what
fitness trackers are for. But it's
definitely not as good as the Apple
Watch. I don't know. I'm kind of torn
because $800 for a watch is a little bit
crazy, but also I have an Apple Watch
and I would not I was going to say like
if you want to go with the cheap watch,
you can take the Apple Watch off right
now and use it for a week. Not use this.
So, I'm not going to lie. I think
expensive is going to have to win on
this one just because I wouldn't be able
to use this fitness tracker. I don't
think it would work well at all. The
next cheap versus expensive product is
this cheap camera and this expensive
camera. Expensive camera wins easy. Like
that. That cheap camera has no zoom.
It screen is going to be terrible and
it's going to be super light, which is a
bad thing. This digital camera I got on
Amazon for
$22. So, this is about to go crazy. It's
like this black. Oh my gosh. This thing
is
Oh my gosh. I told you. Is this going to
be light and rattling around be so bad?
It's so light. It's plastic. Oh, it just
needs batteries. AA batteries. AAA
batteries. I've never seen a camera that
needs batteries. So, this is what the
camera is looking like right now. And
this is a $20 camera. So, this thing
really has to. As of right now, it's
going up against a freaking $4,000
camera. So, this is our Canon R5. This
is like a $4,000 camera. So, we're going
to go ahead and take some pictures
outside and see which one is better.
This is This is so silly. We're going to
put it to shame. I'm sorry. I
said what the 2005 is
this? She like the age 12 years. She's
like dead.
She's like not even born yet in this
[Music]
picture. What are these Instagram poses?
Just cuz you're like a a woman doesn't
mean you have to do whatever that was.
This is actually going to be the most
insane competition ever because $50 for
a laptop is nuts. And 17. Wait a second.
Who won the camera? Who won the camera?
[Music]
Just forgot to draw this. So, uh, this
is actually going to be the most insane
competition ever because $50 for a
laptop, you didn't have a logo. It just
came in a Cadwood box. Nuts. And $1,700
for a laptop is nuts, too. So, first we
have our $50 laptop. I literally found
the cheapest laptop I could find on
Amazon. It's this Lenovo Chromebook and
it's super tiny. I don't know what this
is. Is this just scratch?
That's weird, right? I guess they sent
me like a refurbished one. Crazy. Okay,
that's our $50 laptop versus Yeah,
that's probably some random kids, you
know, Chromebook right there and they
put a heart on it for their person they
liked and then broke up with two days
later. The MacBook Pro. This is going to
be a tough a tough game, my friend. Man,
so nice. Oh my goodness gracious. I
haven't seen this laptop yet. All
black. This is a beautiful computer.
Look at it.
Like heaven. The gates of heaven have
opened. This is going to be a showdown
right here.
flashlight. Okay, so I have both
computers set up and obviously the
MacBook immediately looks better. The
quality of the screen looks better. It's
bigger. It's brighter. The Chromebook,
well, not so much. It's uh definitely
duller, not crispy. But again, what are
you going to be doing with that MacBook?
Like, if you're just using Google Docs
and, you know, watching Tik
Tok ever and just tiny overall. But I'd
rather judge this on performance of the
computers because it's not really fair
to just say, "Oh, this one looks
prettier." So, we're going to run up a
game on both computers to see if they're
able to handle You got a MacBook, but
just not for gaming on a Chromebook.
It's just no the powerful game we're
about to play. Pop Tropica. I freaking
love playing Pop Tropica. And it's kind
of You're playing a cool math games. Hey
guys, this that's f test one of the most
powerful laptops in the world with the
$50 laptop by playing some game that you
could play with in 2006.
a hard game to run. It can get really
buggy if the computer's not good. So,
let's go ahead. How? That's a web game
right there. Pick our character. Okay.
So, here this on this side, it's
working. So, this is this is the type of
game that like kids would be playing in
math class or something. Like, hey guys,
I got the high level. You got high
level. This the same thing like it's
like one of those boy go game thingies.
Super super well. Literally not a single
buggy laggy thing. I would hope
not. Like, it's a website. I would hope
it runs. And also, the quality looks
incredible. And the audio, too, is
amazing. Oh my gosh. This This is the
game that is made in Paint.
[Music]
Okay. I've never seen a benchmark being
used in Pop
Tropica. All right. Pop Tropica is an
online adventure game developed in 2007
by Pearson Education's Family Education
Network targeted towards children aed 6
to 15. Uh-huh. Yeah. This I'm sure this
game is just the thing ran on the DS.
Okay. Of course it's going to run on the
MacBook. I call it it's an actual cool
map game. No, really? Who would have
thought that this game would run on a
MacBook? I I I couldn't have seen this
one coming. It's a game made in 2007. Of
course it of course it runs on that. It
should run on both. Fine.
This is so fun. Okay, now let's go ahead
and try over here. Immediately the color
colors are like not very good. We
already established that when you said
the screen was brighter and bigger and
better just when you looked at the
wallpaper. It has nothing to do with the
game. Super dull. But wow, it's actually
running pretty well.
Like I can't believe the actual shock
this woman has. Wow. I can't believe a
browser based game released in 2007 runs
around on a Chromebook from
2024. I'm shocked. Shocked even that a
Chromebook can run a Chrome
tab. This was your benchmark. You have
all these benchmarks ahead of you. Yeah,
you have actual browser based benchmarks
and you said nah, let's play uh some
prop chop prop topica. I've never played
or heard of this game in my life. Let's
uh let's let's see how well this game
plays as I'm live streaming. I have a
whole bunch of apps open. Uh am I? Let's
uh claim this. All right, let's go.
[Music]
Whatever. What is
this? Do I have to wear
this? Come on. Can I just do what I'm
supposed to be doing? Oh my
[Music]
gosh. Like, do you guys actually think
this thing takes time to load? I don't
care
who. Yes.
Okay. I'll drag him to move. Wow, guys.
Look at this. you you can walk in a 3D
2D
uh animated thing easily. That's
great. Uh yep, that's Pop Tropica for
you guys. There looks like it loads
pretty fairly easily. Um yeah, so I
I what what even was that? All right,
let's see. Let's share back to the
screen.
Uh I
what? No, really. I can't leave without
a Chromebook when a Chrome tab perfectly
fine. So that's that's good. It's not
doing too shabby. Honestly, almost just
as responsive as the other one for
Duh. Absolutely duh. $50. Like what? The
volume's not too great. Wow. I can't
believe a 18-year-old game runs well on
a Chromebook, right? It's a little
laggy. Little little bit. Oh. Oh. Okay.
Okay. Maybe not this one. Okay. So, this
one is like significantly slower to use,
which is very laggy. All right, though.
It's fine. Happens. Dollars to make the
complete mystery box. Give an employee
$5,000 to make us a complete mystery
box. Oh my gosh, this is so difficult
because this computer is obviously
better, but for $50 for this laptop to
be Oh, man. Like, is she right under the
circumstances that she
chose? Yes. But this woman just ran
YouTube and some 18-year-old game on a
Chromebook, so of course it's going to
work. Okay, you can find that thing off
a smartwatch. Be able to do everything
that this one does. For me, a good
computer is really, really important.
So, I would say that the more expensive
one is I mean, yes, but aside from video
editing, I mean, apparently if the only
two things that you can think of is
YouTube and Pop Tropica, I mean, you'd
probably deserve a Chromebook. Again,
what are these for? Worth the money? The
expensive team is going to have to win
on this one. Next thing we have is smart
glasses. We have the Apple Vision Pro
versus Son. Those aren't even glasses.
It's more like a V. You wait. So, these
smart glasses are $4,000. And these
smart glasses were $12. Oh, this is
going to be a very, very unfair
comparison. I'm going to put them back
on. Okay, so this is what a $4,000 smart
glasses can get you. Nope, I'm not
buying this thing again cuz she didn't
even unbox it. Obviously, you have
floating apps in front of your face.
It's just craziness. You can see through
the world and you can still see that the
stuff. And you can also go into an
atmosphere. Dude, this is I keep
forgetting how freaking cool the Apple
Vision Pro is. Like I'm literally in the
woods and it's raining and I see the
pond. Why would I ever travel anywhere
ever again? $4,000 can take you around
the world. You see this? Oh my gosh.
Wait. Okay, I'm taking this home. This
is insane. Why? I literally have used
this before. Why am I acting like I
don't know what this is like. This is
crazy. You can literally play cards like
you're really there in front of you. The
Apple Vision Pro is by far one of the
most insane. Okay, I guarantee you the
$12 value earbuds just going to be like
uh earl is just going to be like
earbuds. Best glasses gadget out there
and it is just insane for the like what
you get. It is insanely expensive as
well though. I don't want to take it
off. Oh, the real world. I don't like it
out here. And now time for our $12 smart
glasses. So, they come in this little
case. Lot smaller. Wow. Check them out.
Dude, these are actually pretty nice.
Like they have a nice shape. They look
very modern. Okay, so there's no shot I
accidentally bought like normal glasses,
right? Well, no, cuz they have like
little speakers on them. Okay, so it
took forever to turn them on because
they're whack, but these are supposed to
come with a lot of cool features. Okay,
so they're connected and we should be
able to listen to some music. Oo, that's
what I said. This is going to be music.
Like, how is this even a fair
comparison? You could at least gone with
like Xville or something, which actually
puts stuff at AR. Hey guys, you can
listen to music or you can transport
yourself to the moon. What do you think
is better?
Dude, this is pretty cool for like $12.
But I feel like it's kind of
embarrassing cuz everyone can hear your
music, you know? Okay, what if I had
This goes again. You have music. My
music. Or can you still hear it? Hold
on. Can you still hear it? That's
embarrassing. Why not just wear
headphones? I don't get it. I feel like
this. You could wear these so like you
could feel like like you're in a movie,
you know what I mean?
[Music]
Uh um
uh what what's wrong with the editors?
What why why do editors hate her? What?
Like
just just just look at this.
[Music]
Also, I think they're supposed to have
microphones in them. So, let's try to
make a call and see if they can hear us.
I want to call my mom. Hi. Hi. You're
done. No. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can
hear you. I'm calling you via my smart
glasses. How do I sound? You sound good.
Really? That sounds good. Okay, cool. I
mean, not like really good, but Okay,
that's all we needed to hear. Bye. Okay,
so honestly, these are really cool and I
do like them and for $12, it's not bad
at all. However, the freaking Apple
Vision Pros, they're worth it. Expensive
wins, though, but whatever. We have the
cheap versus expensive lava lamp. I
think this lava lamp was like 120 bucks
versus our little tiny lava lamp. This
one was like $3. So, three versus $100.
Got to find out. Oh my goodness. This
thing is so small. Oh my goodness. It's
not even a real lava lamp. Like, it's
just like a little keychain. Okay, so
this is our $3 lava lamp. It's not even
an actual lava lamp. It's just a bunch
of little plastic balls in and water. I
mean, it's still cute though, right?
Versus our $120. Okay, big lava lamp
wins cuz Well, it better. Anyway, that
that that's a video here. We're about to
be wrapping up so we can go over to
gaming stream. So, let me stop sharing
the screen. And now we're going to pull
up the soup toys setup screen so we can
go see what that Redditor was talking
about because I installed something a
Redditor recommended on my computer. Uh,
help me today. All right. So, let
me go back to
the How do you show your screen on here?
Oh, there we go.
Let me go back to regular. Oh, nope.
Nope. We don't want
that. I'll just close that
tab. All right. And then we stream kind
of messed up here. Go back to showing
the screen. Here's the Soup Toys logo
screen, people. Let's see what it can
do. Uh, okay. That's It's not showing.
It was the stridest
again. This is great. All right. Got
some toys
here. Oh, it's on the desktop. So, we're
going to have to share something else.
So, we're gonna have to share the
screen.
So, I'm going to open up a clean Chrome
tab. All right. Yeah, guys, I can see
the windowing. There you go. All right.
We're going to have to open this up. And
it's going to interact with all these
toys. So, that's interesting. Let's What
would happen if we took a basketball and
dropped it on a basketball? Wow.
That's This is a game,
people. Uhoh. No.
No. Oh, no. We
missed. Wow. Okay, let's go. Um, what
else we got? This This actually might be
interesting. We got a magnet
here. This
magnetized. It's a magnetic net. Okay.
We can flip it around. This This
actually might be the best thing that a
Redditor has ever said. And you know,
Redditors are pretty stupid. So, put a
baseball in
here. Stupid game. Okay, what else do we
have
here? Oh, we got a
ramp. Dang it.
Okay. Okay. That's That's
interesting. Let's put a cannon
here. Oh. Oh, no. That That was
terrible. Oh, I can't bring them back.
So yeah, that's that's Soup Toys uh for
you
there. Let me go back to the thing.
That's Yeah, that's sad. All right,
we've been on for two hours. I'll be
back on live. We're not going to do
whatever that was. Yeah, we're not going
to be streaming that for a whole four
hours. So yeah, that's your game stream.
God bless and hope to</pre>
