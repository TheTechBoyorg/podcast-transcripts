<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Christmas Eve Podcast + Unboxing a Tmobile Tuesday Light WOW</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to our
Christmas Eve

have a lot of things for you today first
of all we're going to do uh this uh the
tech boy Tech Awards and second we're
going to unbox a T-Mobile light third
we're just gonna celebrate um I guess
Christmas the captain so let's get into
it with the tech boy Tech Awards so let
me go and actually published the awards
um right now
all right guys and by the way I'm still
using the sidekick browser so this is
the tech boy Tech Awards then we'll get
into what we did this week you know what
I'm going to
go back and show you what we did this
week all right this week review not to
be thank you to the not to be who
commented on my site not to be is a
Christian social network on not to be
but of the religions are welcome
um not to be is a website that I listed
in my about me video that I said is one
of my favorite websites so go check this
out I told people how to sign up log in
and how to create an account accounts
are 7.50 a month unless you get someone
who's nice enough to give you a guest
account after your 30-day free trial all
right now um this week I also
interviewed twin folk attack he's a
subscriber come on I mean I'm sorry a
YouTuber let's get to him to um 400
subscribers he's a nice Tech YouTuber
who's been promoting me on Twitter so
thank you to Twin folk Tech it's about a
40-ish minute video but I did encounter
some issues on lumafusing while editing
it so it's kind of sad so I had to use
Samsung's default video editing but in
this twin full Tech video it's just a
video here
yeah it's about 43 minutes that's what
he looks like that's his um
that's the interview I did with them so
please go give that guy a listen to And
subscribe to his channel my channel and
watch the interview alright I also
reviewed sidekick browser on that same
day for I use it for a week I'm still
using it I installed the Chrome but it's
actually kind of slow it's like to stay
beside you can't quite a time being
um oh also you can see that I also
redesigned the website making this black
here
I mean sorry green here this is still
orange but we have a bit of green around
here
[Music]
um
yes what is the tech way I told
everybody what the tech boy was
and how you could oh sorry the gimbal
just turned off
let me mixing this is still recording
yeah okay
um what the takeaway was how you can
support us etc etc
um you know how you can support us but
wherever you are what we stand for Zodi
attack away was found in July of 2020
because I wanted a phone advices and
gadgets to test and you can click
through some of our articles here
um you can also test out our Salvation
message we're just going to make on the
takeaway which is a newer page
so
the tech boy is the houston-based tech
review and news blog and Tech YouTube
channel that strictly Christian values
and is run by a teenager and we also as
you can see down here
say that we're the largest or I have to
fix that largest Christian run Tech log
in Houston 2022 coin Tech talk to you
later alright so that was all we did
this week but I know what you're here
for it's the tech boy Tech Awards and
here we go all right so I decided to
keep those two things that I actually
personally reviewed but some of the
stuff I couldn't you know actually get
so
the best tech side of the year is
the tech boy.org but my also favorite
tech site is um Juan bagnell's um site
some Gadget guys congratulations Juan
you are one of the best tech sites of
the year apart from outside of course
he's been updating it regularly all
right uh most fun products now this was
a hard question I enjoy testing the
cosmo Communicator it was very fun but I
do think the testing of our life camera
was good
foreign
[Music]
camera let's see if you can see over
here
now it didn't break because I was
testing it outside of the waterproof
case so not a fault of our life but
still a very nice product that I would
recommend to anybody who wants a
waterproof uh camera for their kids all
right the best phone all right we had
some competitors this year the a715g my
personal phone that I had yesterday team
plus the phone I upgraded to all the
customer communicated now I have to pick
the plus because it's best overall
battery life is not that good
um but the best one of the year maybe
the pixel 7 or 7 Pro Moto Edge Plus ICE
2 ultra I can put an iPhone in there as
well I didn't get a laptop to test this
year and just got a better tablet so
messed up to you maybe the Mac maybe
some Windows laptop
um it really didn't get many laptops all
right the best value I say the best
value phone is either the Moto Edge
um plus yeah Moto X Plus or the s22 plus
renewed on Amazon not full price we do
it on Amazon okay so you can get s24
plus renewed we're under 500 or the Moto
X Plus or the pixel 7 the S350 plus if
you can survive then that's a good
battery life The Edge Plus if you want
to start this enabled phone stacking
Android but only you can consider have
only two updates and a good desktop mode
right here better than decks and then
pixel 7 is good all around it doesn't
have features like video app all right
most Innovative I say the cosmo
Communicator because you can do a boot
from MicroSD it has a Micro SD card slot
um it has a keyboard and yeah that's it
so I'll edit that fix the grammar up a
little bit and now for the unboxing
you've all been waiting for
the turquoise unboxing the
T-Mobile Tuesdays headlamp so I need to
switch to my camera
this camera is also the mic okay
thank you
foreign
we have the headlamp here
and some batteries
so I'm gonna put the camera back here
and I'm going to show these to the
battle camera the s22 plus actually now
these look to be three AAA batteries
right here
foreign
kids don't do this at home
okay and while I'm unboxing this please
tell me some of your favorite Christmas
traditions

camera
