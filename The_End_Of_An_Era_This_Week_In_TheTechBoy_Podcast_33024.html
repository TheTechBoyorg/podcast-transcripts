<h1>The End Of An Era This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 33024</h1>
<pre>hello
everybody yeah it's the end of an
era work get to that right after this
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello and welcome hello
everybody it's in Era I had an entire
monologue planned about
the the the the stupid social media ban
that is in effect in
Florida and that Ronda santis signed in
love hate them it banned the use of
social media for teens under the age of
16 I had an entire rant to go up
on but
it its effects have been felt on me
personally so let's get into this
so
uh FL the bay social media website NB
you guys true fany so know it
has uh deactivated the accounts of
all people under the age of
18 including me I was one of the most
prolific users starting off November 8th
2022 and ending on
this terrible day of April sorry March
3rd sorry March 30th
2024 God bless you all anyone who's out
there who's listening but let's get into
the rant for all the other kids in
Florida and how this social media band
is wow we already got a
comment wow I can't believe it
hi uh
anyway social media ban Ronda santz
thinks he can actually Bann social media
for teenagers under the age of 16 in
Florida and that is absolutely hilarious
okay first of all this law is stupid
second of all second of all as they say
in kids B we are kids are resilient we
are like weeds okay from a technological
standpoint which is the same problem
with the Tik Tok man uh how on Earth how
on Earth are you going to a prove that
someone's 16 kids do not have IDs okay
kids can't vote they don't have IDs um
how on Earth are you going to prove that
they're 16 second of
all oh
really how I know that they're going to
prove that they're not in Florida
Instagram Facebook meta X do not care
about how old you are on their site okay
if they get more people no matter if
you're one or 100 you will get they they
will get Revenue they don't care who's
on their site so this is going to do the
bare minimum of an age check maybe a
location check or whatever but as I said
kids are like weeds they are resilient
according to kidsboro books right they
will not just sit idly by in a state
where it's illegally use phones in
school uh apparently public schools in a
state where it's illegal to use social
media applications until you're 16 which
which first of all a they can't prove it
B they can't even prove that you're in
said States and see I mean the to
totally many loopholes just get someone
who's older sign up and then let someone
else who's younger use it thir
possession of Instagram Tik Tok uh
Facebook is not a felony it's not
illegal to possess it it's illegal for
them to give it to you because if they
enacted a law that said hey guys
uh Banning if you if you have seen
accessing this website application then
you then you're going to jail then I
mean you might as well just round up all
the geni ands Jo and I know what you're
going to say I know what you're going to
say social media is bad for kids and
it's it's it's it's terrible on their
mental health and and blah blah blah Won
Won but if it wasn't for social
media well in NTB I I wouldn't have
learned the things that I learned I
wouldn't
have this this disclosure which could
happen to lots of Florida team so I'm
experiencing it myself this closure of
the accounts it's basically like
deleading all of your best friends and
and never seeing them
again it's like and I'm against journals
for security reasons it's it's like
taking your journal and burning it
it it is literally some of the only ways
that some teenagers can find connection
with each
other some teenagers do not have phones
to connect with each other and and and
sitting here without without the
collection of of friends that I can talk
to and and having it be deleted and I
know teens in Florida are probably going
through this as well if they're being
forced to comply with the stupid law
which as I've I've heard from some sites
that uh if you feel like a law is unjust
you're not supposed to comply with it or
something like that so you
know
you you cannot rip teenagers away from
their friends I
mean this this this law is stupid a you
can't prove it that and B it's it's
pointless and see it's G to have
devastating effects on on teenagers
who've been ripped away um from their
friends just by a law and I mean it's
not like they're accessing drug and
illegal [ __ ] websites which I know some
teenagers do and those websites should
be banned and blog and and maybe be cons
as legal I'm not I'm not against Banning
certain types websites but I mean
deleting social media applications for
teens just because uh you don't want
them to access it is just just seems
unfair and you
guys had I been if I was back on NCB I
know I'd get lots of flack for this this
this belief I I know I
would I I I know I
would get criticized for this just like
when I criticize provincial control
applications and slam them as malware in
October this this is my true belief I
believe that sometimes social media is a
waste of time yes but if most teenagers
are using them apparently Instagram and
Snapchat at least at my school and
church are are the number one chat
applications because no one really uses
SMS SMS is expensive and insecure uh I'm
just not in favor of banning it I
mean and this brings me to my next topic
which is this book I was reading in
school it it's somehow related if it was
related in my brain
but this book written in
1987 about uh 14s and their parents
about uh I think it's called how to
raise teen how to live with your parents
without going crazy or something like
that and I mean this book has been a
source of
comedy and I I wish you could find find
an updated version that has stuff about
social media and internet
uh but as I'm finding the book I'm just
GNA I'm just going to find I'm just
going to say uh I'm just going to say
that this band is
stupid okay it is technologically
infeasible to enforce second all no
one's really going to care about the
enforcement of the ban uh oh yes here it
is Ken Davis how do live your paray
losing your mind it has updated cover on
Amazon but I'm pretty sure it's the same
the same stuff on the inside and and
it's going to cause
intense
loneliness feelings that I'm going
through right now um well if the band
actually worked like I mean sure uh but
it won't work there ways you can get
around it easy ways you can get around
it anyway here's the book how deliver
your pant without losing your
mind
it is absolutely crazy okay first of all
one of the compromises one of the
compromises it said was that if you
really want to go to a party you should
tell your payment when event odysey came
out 1987 you to tell your parents
that
[Music]
which is the net chance of someone
rebuilding a bridge out of sticks who
doesn't have an engineering degree and
expecting the car to go across it
without the car falling in all just to
say that's a net chance of zero even
this book which which which is crazy
okay I mean if you think that's crazy
point in this book when it gets to the
section on dating I was thinking okay
the obvious thing would be to do would
be to ban it right but of course you
can't say that because as I saying kids
well kids are like weeds they are
resilient that's probably be the the
title of this
episode kids ofia they will get past
your little Florida social media band
they will get past your little parental
control applications they will get past
any and every restriction that you put
in front of them so I know that you
couldn't just outright ban it but I mean
the way that he calls dating which this
is a direct quote from the book at least
as I remember it quote dating should be
a series a series of really good
friendship sh and I say to that
absolutely not this book okay is Absolut
is admitting that dating is going to set
you up for failure oh yes this is how it
links into the social media Story the
same people who say that you should dat
because it gives you the experience on
who you should potentially marry which
is code for yes we know you're going to
fail yes we know that it's that it's not
going to work out we're just letting you
have the experience
of it are the same people probably who
do not want you on social media and what
I have to say for this to this is that
if you put a 13-year-old and I mean I'm
using your logic okay this is not my
logic okay you say Hey you take an 18y
old and say okay no social media until
you're turn 18 until you like are mature
enough to use it shouldn't you do the
same thing for dating a series of of of
of friendships a series of really good
friendships which means you're admitting
that it's going to fail and that that
that is just stupid in my opinion okay
think about it like this let's take two
15 year olds that's uh ninth 10th grade
right maybe even 11th if you me um so
9th 10th 11th grade depends on your age
15 16 year olds two 15 year olds okay so
you got the girl and you got the boy
okay and they come together and they say
hey we're going to uh date each other
which is essentially means that which
according to this book I think the
reason you want to date is because you
have emotions that you can't control or
something stupid like that I don't know
I don't really remember I just like skim
skim reading because it's kind of really
funny and didn't make any sense either
in 1988 or in 19 or in 20124 okay so
you're taking two people with two
different backgrounds two different
beliefs a different sets of par parents
or Guardians whatever different
different rules right you put them
together and you say Hey
look I what like what does this mean
opposed to Friendship then like what
like you're going to hug each other in
the hallway but you don't hug each other
else in the hallway or if you get caught
at the school dance or homecoming or
whatever uh you you can't you can only
dance with this person or something like
that F okay first of all When You're 15
there is no point that's right there is
no goal in sight to dat it there's no
goal like you're not gonna get married
I'm sorry that's that's life like in
Most states it's illegal so uh and that
is a lot that you can't circumvent you
can't just be like unless you like
switch States or whatever and you still
need pral consent
you so you have no goal to just wander
around with this person right and then
you have all these different rules and
sets of backgrounds and clashing and
since you're dating each other you're
going to be trying to you know spend
more time with each other and on top of
that it's not like a normal friendship
where it's just like for you and your
friends to you know hang out and do
stuff whatever normal kids do in fact we
have like entire paid papers on what
normal kids do how to hang out with them
and whatever
uh which I mean now that ntp is down for
us I mean that sent our zero chance down
to even smaller or bigger zero chance
depending on how you look at
that yeah because most kids you know
they can go hop on Instagram or Facebook
or whatever Myspace and say hey I need
uh I need your help and take uh
Instagram polls but that's probably not
something I can really do
yeah anyway so you take these people
from different backgrounds and and
different beliefs and everything and you
put them together you say Hey you now
now you have to control those emotions
you have to laugh me until like I'm 21
and now you can legally marry each other
or 18 or whatever and then and
then yeah I
mean uh the the the chance that it's
going to work out is zero the chance
that it's going to work out is the same
chance of me going and inviting some kid
who goes to my school uh who come here I
mean the chance of that happening is
100% I can control that the the the
chance of a Teenage dating relationship
working out be the exact same chance of
them saying yes and and it actually
happening okay it's probably like 50
maybe 40 20 10% chance that people would
say yes is like a z% chance that it
would actually happen
now a teenage dating relationship
working at which the goal of dating is
obviously marriage right because if
you're just dating for fun or whatever
like I I don't get it just be friends
but the same people will say hey guys
just a date so you know who you want to
marry later which I mean if both people
are going into the assumption that
they're dating just so they can know who
they're going to marry
later then like you're just aimlessly
wandering around looking for a breakup
in my
opinion that yeah
so yeah this book is hilarious the
advice in it is whatever and as we were
talking about kids kids are resilient
kids are like weeds they will resist
um the social media ban they will resist
dating band and Tik Tok bands and any
other thing that you try to ban and poal
control applications and I don't know if
anyone's listening to this or
whatever well to the one person who may
be still listening to this really boring
show that no one cares about
uh paw and Tails came out today I
listened to a little bit as was coming
back home from the robotics
competition uh which I guess I can tell
you the story of my last NTV post it's
interesting if anyone cares or not
uh so PA and TOS came out and the actors
sound a bit a little bit different they
got sounds like they got some of the
original actors but the announcer sounds
different uh some of the other actors
and actresses sound different um there
five episodes are going to be coming out
so this is episode 70 so they're gonna
get to episode 74 so that's great that's
that's great God God
bless them uh I haven't finished the
episode yet because I wanted to get
straight to you guys straight to you
guys and I guess I can tell you your
story of the last post which was
basically some kid was running around
dragg me around the B convention and he
said it was black history time recording
this it is March okay so it's not even
Black History Month which even if it was
Black History Month that's a that's a
terrible excuse for what he did he went
around and said uh to one of the people
and said hey it's black history mom
giveing me a dollar and someone actually
gave him a dollar which is kind of sad I
told this basically scam at this
point yeah
so yeah uh hopefully someone out here
listening this isn't just an echo
chamber of me yapping around um someone
said I graduate from yapping
University top of my class or whatever I
said I'm a professional
yappo because I should get paid to do
this uh I'm trying to start affiliate
marketing I guess because we're really
looking forward to the path for the
Galaxy s24 Ultra hopefully we get that
before school in so I can tape a news
video on it which is so exciting
speaking of exciting the most exciting
technology
website on the internet I mean hey guys
do you think I said start the social
media website I mean here we go uh oh
here we go here's the most exciting Tech
website on the internet top post is
download Instagram followers V account
for free
congratulations
and I'm I'm truly glad for the for the
memories that we had flying the
flag hiding articles and I truly
appreciate you guys guys uh here we go
we got our first ever AI completely AI
written article icept for the God bless
and uh what's it called God bless and
Tech talk to you later thing and the
disclaimer that this was written by
Microsoft
co-pilot so thanks to co-pilot for
writing this article for us it's about
the Galaxy tabx L 2024 that's probably
we going to use to suiz stuff online now
uh for a I should probably not for like
review articles but just know Samsung
news water CL I don't really have like
the I don't really need to go out there
and actually post about it myself it's
pretty easy just summarize it it's just
a news clip you know parti an ad for
Samsung unpaid but you know it gets
volume out there um get brings traffic
to the site it's
great oh yeah we got to talk about the
Apple band The Apple oh we talked about
that last week never mind all right
let's
[Music]
see what what tech video
out there oh someone s like a and timu
style uh I guess we can go into a real I
visited the Samsung store for first time
in 2024 this year um saw the G s24 Ultra
came for that and it was most impressed
by s24 plus honestly yes yes I know this
guy just 20 uh series deal with it uh so
I went hand on Samsung devices the a
felt as T than the S2 I mean everything
felt fast and Destroy must be because
everything's like stripped down and
stuff s24 also was fast I tried to
stimulate my work for I downloaded sh
cut video editing open apps on prop mode
editing recording videos switching
applications lot snap you in my phone uh
is uh apps never crashed and I also did
stuff with the AI image generation it's
okay uh it does re that stupid Watermark
but it it was fine cuz I could crop it
out and I tried to S you the AI
wallpaper but you need a Google account
for it because it seems like that's
actually just like a rebranded Google
thing and I didn't want to sign into my
Google account on like a public Samsung
phone I also compared The Bu phones a25
a15 pretty similar but a25 can extract
text that's that's that um some of the
staff uh no offense well not that
knowledgeable of Samsung
devices uh
they they like I mean they they knew
stuff but like I asked him when the when
the AI stuff would come to s23 and z45
like I don't know when I asked him about
Samsung command you're like what's that
like I mean features been on phone like
I was since I was 12 or something like
that like that's it's kind of sad that
you don't know what that is I mean as a
high chance that I could work there now
even though I'm too young then someone
comes over but I mean hey you guys you
want to want stats on that yeah you
could and I will tell you if someone
comes over of course now I don't have
the helping backing of uh the uh fans
over NB uh the collective intelligence
which means now we're back to talking to
ah watch which are notoriously bad at
like trying to understand what I'm
trying to say because I always like he
be sure to to be sure to talk it out
with your counselor and and and and and
talk to talk to people about the way
that you feeling and uh and uh try to
make make a contract with your parents
and I'm like shut up that's not the
problem oh my gosh like the problems we
have was like kind of complex here why
we do all
thinking um and where we're just
rambling oh wait wait wait the lighting
condition in that store imaculate which
is a problem because you can't really
try to simulate L light photography or
anything like that uh speaking of
Photography the Galaxy Tab S9 ult the
camera is pretty decent to zoom again
there was like oh tablet is speaking to
my laptop it's pretty impressive
um
yeah Google Gemini is kind of decent I
guess I don't know
um the Google pixel XL seems like it's
uh coming
back tech Odyssey so that's great and
let's talk about the battery life GS 24
series versus the other phone Series in
the series one
nation so yeah um I don't know how we're
going to advertise I mean half my user
face came from that I mean we basically
catered to the group over
there
uh you know tomorrow's Easter
um Jesus rose from the dead make sure
you go to
church God loves all of
you yeah so let's let's let's talk about
the battery life the the battle of the
small phones paying off your phone break
device contct there go if you want a
compact phone your choice is getting
more and more limited every year and
right now in
2024 we got the uh looks like we got the
Samsung Galaxy S 24 series and then
maybe the a series I know that's the
same phone has two of them so he wants
to send them here that's nice and we got
this the regular pixel 8
iPhone is probably like 15 Pro then Asus
is in phone 9 so I mean Android should
win I mean SP against one they have an
80% chance of winning which I mean if
those are my statistics on
getting people to come over here and do
stuff uh which uh Chad gbt not Chad gbt
copilot suggested that I uh have people
come over here and bake well AB
test that that interesting uh
few available options on the market the
galaxy s24 is the newest but we also
have last year's Galaxy s23 sing at a
lower W okay okay okay good for them
good for them you know one thing I
noticed from those FC competition is how
good uh how needed a good battery like I
bought my charger but wish I better
battery life and my phone's been
crashing sometimes that's not good
crashing phones are not
good that's a that's a important quote
for me another important quote is the
gate is open but the door is locked you
can figure out what that means whatever
right we also have the iPhone 15 Pro of
course Google has the pixel 8 and
finally you have one less known phone
the Asus and phone 10 10 sorry sorry
sorry sorry I thought that was a nine uh
I should be better at this AC devices
and then after this I guess we can talk
about best budget devices on T-Mobile
because I have someone who I mean who
knows he listening right now uh who son
upgrad is Galaxy a20 uh and for phones
under $
3250 and the best phone I saw was 1 N300
and the the specs are great like great
storage Great uh great Ram I was like oh
man this phone is great maybe I'll get
it myself like the only thing better
different from my phone is the camera
the problem is I think we talked about
that the chip is not that
good well mean it's probably better than
the a20 like it beat the a20 by like 30%
processing which should make
actual day-to-day interactions good I
yeah like day-to-day interaction on my
s20 plus kind of slow but they're decent
on the a20 it's like torture I mean
that's the kind of phone you give to
people that you're trying to interrogate
with a fast chipset fast performance but
which one has the best battery line
that's what we're about to find out
right now is we have prepared a couple
web browsing and YouTube I I like to see
some more intensive stuff like you know
stuff I do like editing video recording
video
podcasting video
generating test for
you here are the battery sizes of each
device here on the table the galaxy s24
has a 4,000 mAh battery slightly bigger
than the s23 the iPhone traditionally
has screen went up so the smallest
battery pack I wonder how they figure
that out that's super precise
3,274 like apple doesn't even
advertise that that's kind of small
battery especially for a phone that has
all of that less than 3,300 milliamp
hours and then that's what this with the
Galaxy no8 had back in
2017 seven hour seven year Battery
Technology pixel actually has the
biggest battery here wow big pixel good
for it I wonder how much the T to take
uh affected that deis 4575 milliamp
hours okay finally the Zen phone 10 fat
again pretty good second highest on the
list so it goes Lugal Seuss Samsung
Samsung and then everyone's love it them
I hate them Apple 4300 Milli B which
I've had to defend about the Vision Pro
from people and stuff like that and in
the anti trust case
that's call me the Apple Fanboy with all
of this in mind let's see what the
actual performance on these phones is
and for that we start with our first web
browsing battery test now before we
start the test website is
this ESP oh phone.com
the same setting so we have equal
conditions what is this phone Arena has
news we run the same web pages over a
Wi-Fi connection until the battery dies
simple so this is what this is probably
their internal test website cuz I doubt
that
they have news on Phone Arena that's
looks like and for brity that is
obviously what is this
box we don't show you the full test run
here because it takes long hours but
we'll only show the actual results so
let's go ahead and zip forward to the
boring part and end right here when okay
this just give a rundown on the browsers
they using uh all of them are using
Chrome except for iPhone which is using
Sai it' be kind of interesting to see if
they use all default browsers so say
they use Samsung internet on Samsung's
phone iPhone Safar obviously on the
iPhone and then Chrome on Theus or or
wait I wonder ifus and could cooperate
like that way and stuff be interesting
or they could just all use Chrome like M
use Chrome something like that but no or
whatever anyone talking Ariel Smith are
you still watching uh who are you
we see the black screen on the first
phone this news is
old I think you can't impeach a
president who's not president anymore
can you I
think that is the iPhone 15 Pro which
finishes with a score of 14 hours and 54
minutes oh oh this is about how I died
dang that would be a long video 14 hours
of just scrolling which I wonder how
Samsung's did performs because they have
ltp which is about the average for this
test good but not great so let's keep on
going and next phone taps out and that
is the Galaxy s23 time on the clock is
15 hours and 21 minutes so slightly
better than the iPhone but I'm G say
pixel's gonna die let's keep on going
andung you optimization another phone
die is GNA flip it over is the Google
pick away oh my gosh I am him
predictions too right in a row H yes yes
finishing the test with a score of 15
hours and 39 minutes okay I think at
this
Pointon left so let's see whether
thex can beat the Zen phone or not so we
zip forward and the answer is no told
yeah man man great three for
three galaxy is the next phone to die
and time on the clock is 16 hours and 18
minutes Asus just has to small the
screen out of all of them 5.9 in plus
they're design to be small and they have
a larger battery than the Samsung s24 I
mean you could do all the kind of
battery optimization that you want which
is why you know Samsung beat the pixel
even though it has a larger battery and
Samsung beat Samsung because it has a
larger battery and better software but
you cannot beat the sheer Grunt and
powers for wats and just just like this
is just designed to be the s24 plus like
little squeeze this is designed from the
ground up to be a small phone now this
is a good score nearly an hour and a
half more than the iPhone but not enough
to win this test oh previously we have
seen that the Zen phone 10 has great
endurance and this seems to be the case
again we have to wait and wait and wait
and finally the Zen phone 2 also dies
with wait for it an incredible score of
27 Oh My
Gosh [ __ ]
okay let's put this in context 27 hours
18 minutes that is more than a day of
web browsing just sit I assume on Wi-Fi
okay and put putting this in context
that is twice the iPhone so you could go
to like two iPhone 15 pros and you'll
have the equip of the inen phone okay
for the Samsung I'm going talking about
s24 plus here that's about oh my
gosh 11 hours more so that's like a day
and a half more no not day and a half
like half a day longer than the uh
Samsung and then just for the pixel
basically the same thing just amazing in
28 minutes that is what a phone is
ground it's time the ground up to be a
small phone looks like when that
endurance is crazy of course this just a
web browsing test on an internal website
that reloads the same stuff so I mean
the browser probably costed whatever's
in over WiFi and 16 hours is like enough
um but 27 hours 18 minutes
wow this is a record score not just for
a compact phone but for any size phone
and we don't know what magic the xan
phone is pulling to achieve that I mean
look at this oh it's kind but it
definitely works and here's once again a
chart recapping the scores for all the
phones in this
test yeah and I was most impressed by 24
plus at the Samsung store by the way but
I mean
I think we might pivot yeah I think we
might change our hashtags to from path T
s24 Ultra to path to s24 PL all right we
have this one test behind we have one
more YouTube video playback and for this
test we run all right for video playback
who do I think is going to win this
thing okay um okay so is it gonna be an
Android phone obviously I mean Apple
unfortunately well fortunately has
everything working against it first of
all it has the smallest battery right it
has the largest screen is one of the
largest in this test like it's the
average here uh it it's also using
YouTube which is not an Apple
application so it's not like optimized
for Apple silicon it's just you know
it's an app um so it's gonna be one of
the Android FR it's gonna interesting
Samsung may win because of the lcpo
display technology um Google I don't
think they can optimize well enough to
beat out Samsung on the video playback
but Asus they they could pull this
through from the same YouTube playlist
on all of the phones measuring the time
it takes for a full drain so once again
we have all phones okay
so let's think about this let's think
about
this the assus has a smaller screen look
look at this look at the bezels on that
thing
the playback could actually this test
could be defined because it's not
scientific if say the phone speakers are
better then 50% of a phone speaker let's
say the iPhone speakers are better than
say the pixel if the iPhone speakers are
better than the pixel and is using 50%
then it's using more power for the same
percentage that they put on for the
video audio test second of all the
screen I don't know how many HTS this
will refresh at I know for the iPhone
it's probably going V60 or
120 uh but for the Android phones I'm
not sure uh if they help do any
magic charge up ready to go and we kick
off this second test so I personally
watch a ton of YouTube videos it's a bit
of an addiction and I bet many of you
will be curious about the results from
this test so let's once again skip
forward until the first phone dies see
the results and first the black screen
appears on yo oh called it my goodness I
should have made a watch mad inness
bracket perfect record right here iPhone
15 Pro we flip it over and Mark 6 hours
in 54 6 hours oh my goodness
minutes which is a bit below the average
but still a decent score so let's keep
on going and we have to wait for a while
until we see another phone die more than
an hour after the iPhone and it's the
Galaxy s23 oh just Google Google's
optimize applications
and the uh larger capacity which for
like R screen just held out longer CU
say which makes sense which makes sense
the pixel is newer and has more optimiz
software and they can work you know
directly with Google work with
themselves flip it over and
marxel that is a much better showing now
let's see which one is next and this
time only a few minutes after the s23 we
see the Galaxy s24 dies what oh my
goodness okay okay okay I'm wrong now
but now I definitely guarantee pixel is
going to
die I wonder what the screen modes were
I wonder what the screen modes were
because I know that like it's same HD
but I wonder if he had in Vivid or
brightness of video or
something scoring eight hours and 20
minutes not a huge difference between
these two Samsung phones and this time
the battle for the gold will be between
the pixel and the Zen phone probably
already guess where this one is going we
zip forward and yes we see the black
screen now on the pixel so it finishes
with a score of nine hours and 36
minutes definitely great for a compact
phone but not the best so it's the Zen
phone 10 that will win this one the
question is by how much exactly and once
again we have to wait a very long while
so let's skip forward and finally we see
the Zen phone tap out and the final
score it gets is 14 hours and 14 dirty
with some settings change the volume a
little bit maybe change the refresh rate
you can hit 15 you could hit 15 but I
mean that is impressive 5 hours 30
minutes longer than the pixel and just
six hour longer than the Samsung's I
mean for the iPhone that is two and a
half iPhones longer in 30 minutes one
word wow the zphone 10 dominates the
battery charge easily just take a look
at the recap for this YouTube test it's
not even
close interesting filter they use here
like the old film
St so what have we learned at the end of
the day well first we have learned that
the biggest battery does not guarantee
you the best battery life well I mean
Zen phone had the second biggest batter
right yeah
so it's kind of sad I had to my NTB
kids they uh who works for the agency
they all I have no way of contacting
since anyway where were we go not even
close the Google pixel 8 has the biggest
battery cell but it is not even close to
the battery life you get from the Zen
phone 10 the other lesson is about the
new Galaxy s24 it scored slightly higher
than the previous Galaxy s23 model
that's good and it also lasted a bit
longer than the iPhone 15 Pro but not by
much and in the grand scheme of things
this is well I mean I wouldn't buy that
for battery I buy plus it's 4,500 I
believe and s24 Ultra 5,000 Milah
battery two day long a one day phone we
however really wish there were more
phones in this category a just change
the definition of small mix 6.5 the new
6 in phone from OnePlus would be great
for example but it just seems that most
phone makers are only focused on making
I mean if people buy more smartphones
they may make more smartphones
capitalism bigger
phones now one rumor we have just
recently heard is given us hope Google's
next pixel 9 might be an even more
compact phone and we also cannot wait to
see if I releases a new xen phone 11
this summer anyway that's it for the
smaller phones we have right now let me
know which one are you using and if
you're happy with the battery
[Music]
w
that is great I don't know what else
we're going to talk about today um any
any
questions
uh
um yeah I'm going to stop sharing the
screen here uh any to's see what's
happen in Tech news uh maybe you can
check check the notifications
again just check out the uh the Galaxy
S let's just let's go to versus.com PR
good
website versus.com uh here we go
hopefully you can see this
on the
screen okay so here here's one so we got
a20 this this is
like all I'm good for
apparently
um so let's get the galaxy2 and then
let's compar to
the hopefully someone send us a phone
so oh they compare with voice assistants
that's
interesting is of 2024 okay okay so I
got the N300 and the a20
uh so the a20 I mean over N300 better
battery more RAM better cameras 1.5
times faster C that's wait no this the
wrong phone sorry
guys
okay first is
the OnePlus inity 5G I was gonna say
like this this phone is basically the
same phone just no different skin at
that point
oh
uh yes yes here it is here it is because
we got more modern design here 25% more
battery fatter screen eight gigabytes of
RAM instead three batter screen again
higher
camera8 megapixels 29% faster clock
speed there we go there we go and better
French speaking facing
camera and uh you guys if you need
election uh
uh what do they call them campaign
managers uh you sure to reach out to me
we're trying to Branch out into that
business things I think I'm pretty good
at election
managing
um all right we got a 120 HZ display and
a headphone jack fi quality great
display great battery life is great and
the only thing 320 wins on is has
branded damage resistant glass has a
radio which okay why the Wi-Fi version
is I mean they don't know so okay and
it's lighter but that's means that if
you Jo at someone it's not GNA hurt as
much has a seos sensor which is like
the thing that I think
it the
uh it does something it
uh
yeah convert light to electrical sens
yeah
signals for cameras I guess okay okay
and it's smaller but that's probably
because the screen is
bigger and if you want let's a
comparison I'm actually interested in
this if the a20 is worse than the a15
that'd be kind of interesting don't you
think you know this
is
there we go let's
comp oh my gosh of course this also has
more storage and the OnePlus the a15 is
better than the a20 that's
crazy okay let's see here bigger battery
bigger screen more RAM wait this is the
same phone this is literally the same
phone this is Samsung's a one is
everyone doing the same thing better
camera oh my God fast through CPU speed
off the charge uh 253 gab of storage
crazy crazy crazy what what what what is
a20 better at honestly let's see branded
damage okay it's the same stuff okay um
well there's no question to no one's
really watching so God
bless Tech talk to you
later</pre>
