<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 9923 @TheCommentsSection Brett Cooper Please Don't Take My Job</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to this week
in the tech boy uh sorry hello everybody
and welcome to this week in the tech boy
podcast
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
well well well looks like that my job is
over and I've been replaced by
everyone's second favorite YouTuber
after me of course second favorite gen Z
YouTuber after me I have been replaced
by at I'm Brad Cooper with the comments
section because she now is a
um Tech reviewer and
series of them viewing Tic Tac so my job
has been stolen
um
I will have to get
a new one so
I guess this is the last episode of
y'all
um
producer shoulder clip
random person trying to sell me an
iPhone tripod mount snail well it looks
like we're just taking
tech reviews so sad random person try
that's right Tech talk to you later uh
my job has been stolen by Brett Cooper
well
as this last podcast episode I would
like to say that um
I got a new drum so that's nice power up
sent me to power up
um airplane drone
did you make it out of paper 4.0 I
haven't really flown it yet because it's
supposed to fly it outside but I built
it last night this is what I got
not bad for first try using the paper in
the Box they also sent over some papers
some a book A book of papers so that I
could
have them
two
make other types of planes and they also
say on their YouTube channel they won't
even test out of food could fly so
you know that's a question that all of
us have at one point or enough if
the fly
just lagging contest
no okay yeah so that's a question that
all of us have at one time one other can
food fly
so
if you want to know
can food fly
we will find out today because they use
the module because the smart module can
fly stuff
so it's a smart module which means you
can weigh stuff which means it's going
to be easier to fly so without
um further Ado we will see if food can
fly courtesy of power-up toys for three
years ago
hello Pilots of the internet and welcome
to power up in this video I am
I'm taking on a bit of a challenge and I
don't know exactly what's going to
happen but shy keeps telling me that the
power up 4.0 can fly literally almost
anything as long as it's light enough
and so I'm going to try and construct
test it out here we go see sketches
about he draws his I'm hoping that the
plane will apply with uh we got a piece
of latitude and a
orange stinky and as you can see here
he's in a field so I need to go take my
plane out to a field because
but it's also very windy here in Houston
so I can't fly in the backyard I need to
take it out to a field and fly it and
preferably deliver everyone throughout
maybe next week or two weeks from now
we'll just see about that angle and go
slow at first so we can see if it's
working before we have some kind of
catastrophic crash here so with that
let's turn her on and get it started oh
I forgot to mention yes you fly with
your cell phone
um so no no computer Flying Cloud remote
control there was no camera on there but
it uses some type of special function
excuse me here well you can take use the
camera on the on your phone to kind of
like use AR to fly that
happens
[Music]
obviously we need some vertical
stabilization it's it's spinning on us
but I think even more we just gotta rid
ourselves of some weight so that's the
first sacrifice and we'll see where that
gets us
all right here we go again without the
vertical stabilizer let's see what
happens
[Music]
okay so I'm gonna make a few changes
here first I'm going to bend down I mean
just building anything on that's a piece
of kale okay what are going to be
effectively elevators on these canards
and yes you have to bend them down
because they're in front of the center
of gravity and then I'm also going to
slide These Wings forward a little bit
to try to move the center of gravity
backwards I really won't just want to
see this nose up a bit rather than dive
down just to give it a chance it's not
not achieving an angle of attack where
it could even really generate lift yet
so we'll see if that does it for us
well you know that's that's good enough
and welcome back to this but you know
when someone's trying to take your job
you know
you should know about that so today
we're going to react to this new
disturbing tic-tock train that brick
group will hates and that I hate guests
because you know I'm famous for eating
Tick Tock and um
I guess I said Thank you for taking my
job because they got me 2.6
000 views last time I checked so you
know it's it's
it's okay for now
um but let's check out
um the
her video here
it's called Tick Tock shop has ruined by
fyp
what's that producer is telling me that
fyp stands for for you profile which I
obviously know as a esteemed Tick Tock
expert and
you know basically twin setting
how much did Jesus's Crossway
oh yes I forgot we have to talk about
um
this this people people please break the
mic right here as the defender of tech
on internet defender of AI and yes chat
GPT use is declining down I'll tell you
what I did about that coming up on the
podcast
don't do stupid stuff
please if you make my job hard
okay look black hoop is already taking
my job would you make my job even harder
when you do stupid stuff with AI where I
have to disagree with okay we'll talk
about that coming out after this okay
and then we'll talk about the some new
Samsung phones coming out
um maybe we could talk some oh sent
so we got a fully packed episode here
today
Brett Cooper can't do all of this but
she can do oh remember remember
um you gotta check his and we can check
the transcript you know it makes it any
bad words in there because you know it's
just a family show and um
you know we wouldn't want to you know
cue any of those because then we have to
go off here
property sin you know
that's like shut up shut up
oh my goodness
no be quiet stop screaming at me please
good grief just getting so laggy
speaking of lagging um
we're selling a phone on eBay I will
list it on my Google my business profile
and maybe we can
invest in some technology maybe a new
phone I saw like a folded for 600 on
eBay
um so if you sell this on the way you
have more reviews it's a win-win for
everybody all right so
without further ado right clipper
welcome back to the comments section I'm
Brett Cooper earlier in the year my
favorite least favorite app the app that
I have a toxic relationship with Tick
Tock introduced a new feature called
well I mean true
it is literally her job or her previous
job to react to tick tocks
but
you know it's also what
buy it
so
you know trade-off Tick Tock shop and
they slowly rolled it out to people I
think that it started in the US and
other countries started to get it but it
like trickled out onto people's for you
Pages it took a while to get to me but
that one is here and it is the worst
thing that could have ever happened to
this app or maybe it's the best we'll
discuss that in a second before we do
them make sure that you like this video
subscribe to the channel here kind of
brutal because she's like
I even got one of these comments over
not the video like yeah you know what
hey I don't want you to be selling stuff
and Jen it's like oh well buy some rough
greens for my dog here you're using but
you know she has to eat too
when she's not Stephen jobs for me this
is my job not yours
if not already and ring that
notification Bell so that you never miss
a comment section upload alright so my
Tick Tock used to be filled with you
know funny videos and regular people
going viral for their hot takes and
their authenticity and of course
does anybody really believed it the
stuff that she reacts to that is not
normal funny of course the insanity that
I would feature on the show okay yes
okay oh going to tick tock was where I
would get most of my content but yes I
brought it people already post dumb
stuff
it's like it
a bit of
idiots
that's right here you go we can quote
this we will make this in canva
technologer says
is a bit of idiot
but now it is literally just shopping
and ads and it is absolutely awful and
we have Tick Tock shop to blame yeah
I mean the CCP has to make money somehow
[Music]
now like I said in the introduction Tick
Tock shop is this new feature on Tick
Tock and it is a in-app shopping
platform where creators can either sell
their own products like if a small
business wants to sell something or they
can link products from another company
and then if one of their audience
members buys it they will then receive a
commission and it's a built-in affiliate
marketing blog student
YouTube channels do that look in the
descriptions of YouTube Channel videos
you'll see that not mine yet but it's
interesting it basically tick tock's own
affiliate marketing pretty smart easy
way to purchase within the app you don't
have to leave the app you just put in
your credit
card information
talk will literally ship it to you so I
went Tick Tock shipping stuff to me
oh yeah I just got this new
iPhone case off of tick tock like
is it like a third party thing you would
originally told me about this feature
last year before I knew anything about
it I would have probably been on board
because one of the coolest things about
Tick Tock is how it is Amplified small
businesses yeah I saw one of those ads
today on TV over the last few years
allowing people to shop in app would be
a game changer for these small
businesses who have blown up who have
gone viral and
not really like to just
put a link in the description to your
affiliate Mark boom goes to your store
you'll probably get more money and
probably get a higher cut because you
can
set the type that you wanted to pay like
29 a month for Shopify
news lives have been totally changed
through the power of virality and the
social media network but now influencers
have gotten hold of the feature
what were you expecting Brett way
through him Zeus oh dude did you mean
that they found a way to make money
wait what you expected to gotten hold of
it wouldn't be like gotten hold of it
what was it like something a secret
feature that they wouldn't allowed to
get but then they like broke the
encryption and got one are you crazy now
literally every single video on my for
you page is a random person trying to
sell me an iPhone tripod mount snail
mucin or snail Museum which actually is
a fantastic skincare product yeah yes
male mucus I think but um
was a very famous scene from Adventures
United States but funniest information
we're honestly when they're putting
snail mucus on Connie's face and then it
goes badly so I use it every single day
but I don't need every single influencer
and her mother selling it to me also the
deal well speaking of our food there's a
story of why not to be from two years
ago where this girl had like 1.7 million
let me repeat myself
1.7 million followers on Instagram on
Tick Tock I think which I mean I'm
anti-tic but like yeah that is money
making right there and the Memphis
whatever you make money and your mom
deleted her account because she didn't
want to
I don't know like fake in identity
hey
that's sketchy
oh
to say these odorizing supplements is
always on there and the damn curling
iron oops
I forgot to search that
too I'm only apologies 10 am
people listening and the um audience and
break up with you so I'll be recommended
for that in um infraction
which has allegedly been on a flash sale
for the last two months you know full
well it hasn't been on a flash sale for
the last two months it's a scam and
people will not if I have to see another
video of somebody curling their hair
with that little revolving curling iron
I will punch something the entire app is
an ad that little orange hmm what do you
think allowing people to upload stuff
for free going viral creating payouts
they got to make money somehow
square that pops up on a tick tock Shop
video is the bane of my existence this
is what it looks like here's a couple
well maybe you'll get off of tick tock
and maybe you'll stop using an iPhone
screenshots
[Music]
watch this entire ad oh my goodness
dude
all right let's see for the
notifications you got for my phone here
I still got ads going on
oh yeah Snapchat
we gotta talk about that Snapchat I
don't know what's going on with Snapchat
these days
said my headphones be white because you
know Brett Coopers are white this girl's
selling the damn curling iron the beach
waiver you're as you can see Tick Tock
shop beachwave rotating curling here's
another one 49ers foot cooling iron are
you kidding me I'm pretty sure okay look
I'm not a girl
yeah breaking local Tech Parker
with something the tech boy is not a
goal anyway I'm pretty sure you can get
a curling iron for 20 dollars and it's
just like heat
well I'm pretty good let's put some heat
on here
one she is selling some kind of like
eyeliner if you click on it you can buy
it here's a video example if you love
your boyfriend you need these
I literally just got them in the mail
all right
so
I'm pretty secret first of all they
don't even look like they fit they were
talking about
sweatpants
and um if you haven't noticed it's the
hottest months on record it's it's the
end of the day it's the hottest day in
the 120
000 views which um according to my
calculations is like uh what's 120 000
divided by six thousand
twenty one two three
yeah it's like 20 times more than the
earth has existed
um yeah so anyway so how about this year
on record is those is gonna burn it's
like a hundred million billion degrees
outside why are you selling sweatpants
so cute and they're saving for college
now I'm watching this is that a plastic
bag
be still on my computer but on the
mobile version of this you see the
little stupid square and you can click
it and you can order it and you can buy
it you do not need these sweatpants you
do not need them yummy you need oh my
God you need this part you know you know
no you don't that is the message of this
episode you do not need to buy every
single thing that somebody posts on Tick
Tock please
I'm sure there's an audience you're
smarter than that like you do not spend
your money that way like these are not
even products that we need or that would
benefit our life
segue to left Green's product they're
not like rough greens which is a problem
two
one
that's that's
really benefit your life and well and
benefit the dog's life they're not yours
but a necklace
look at that face
oh my goodness for it
of course she could run to the left foot
um slash Brett or call 877-66 actually
something that I think people could
benefit from congratulations instead of
all this stupid weird crap from China I
have no idea and the other thing that I
noticed that I only realized yesterday
when I was putting together this episode
is that these products are even popping
up in the table you put your episodes
together you mean you have a script
maybe I should try that talk search bar
so if you want to find a video about
something like oh I want to find some
skincare or you know oh I heard about
that you know deodorizing supplement the
product comes up
there's one thing you need to do before
buying anything online spend another
dime on Amazon until you watch this
first watch this I can show you how to
get the sweet skip
and back before the video this is a
video platform but instead you just see
what you can buy like I don't want to
buy deodorizing supplements on Tick Tock
I don't trust who's selling them like is
that a Drop Shipping scheme is this
actually the brand I have no idea and
you really can't figure it out because
it all looks the same oh my God I hate
this platform anyway so exhausting this
is like the most ridiculous thing to be
exhausted by exhaustive she says
exhausted
um
but considering the fact that I spend a
significant amount of time on Tick Tock
this has really sounded like a whole
problem trying to stay up to date on pop
culture and like
like pulling content it is cruelly
so you telling me that Brett Cooper in
addition to taking my tech review job
um and taking my status as the number
one Genji tick tock disliker
um
this job is also to explore watching
tick tocks
three request goes on answered as it was
posted onto it
okay we gotta check out
right after this
it's really been grinding my gears
anyway the Atlantic wrote a piece on
Tick Tock shop and I think that they
summed it up well and they said take
in particular might be ill-suited for
shopping at its root Brett Cooper's now
going to the Atlantic but that's all
right tick tock has more of an
authenticity culture than Instagram does
which is very true somebody pointed out
that the apples oh really good time is
more of an authenticity cold suit in
Instagram are you kidding me doesn't
taste like I have like filters
actually so refreshing because the
people going viral were influencers they
were just regular people who happened to
be famous by accident that's one of the
things that I loved about it because if
like you were watching videos from
somebody who could be your best friend
like it was very casual it was not
contrived at all in theory that could
also lend them credibility as
salespeople but it could also work
against the platform why is that random
person on Tick Tock who seemed like a
friend now trying to sell things and
thankfully I am not the only person who
is fed up here's a post from a few like
people are fed up and mad and upset all
right and that's basically I wanted to
see from black people like maybe we'll
come back soon but you know we have a
far more pressing issue here
as
um
Instagrams threads magistrates
yeah Meta Meta threads program is
is
you know
I don't know maybe it's not been
utilized by many I don't know how many
people use anymore I'm pretty sure still
have one of the top most downloaded
applications from producing usage time
it's down just like chat gbt
and um according to the most authentic
authoritative news site on the internet
well if it gets past this add because I
cannot afford to pay
um
please let me have oh my goodness
why is it on Instagram
what what is this
okay oh my goodness
anyway hurry up before I could open your
mouth again
okay
um as my computer is slowly loading into
background I mean really slowly here it
is
loading here it is I as you can see on
screen
request goes unanswered as it was posted
on threats Instagram matters threads
here it is Rutland
VT and the story that seems to have
heartbreaks or heartbreak a local
Christmas favorites it's gone unanswered
as it has been posted on dreads
because
it went on answers because no one uses
straight that's the joke there and the
most authoritative Insight on the
internet so
here we go
don't post prayer requests on threats
back today
oh no I'm back I'm back okay maybe I
should turn on my hotspot there you go
oh
that reminds me
or get we'll get to the story soon
um we're going to talk about Discovery
mountain and how it
um
technology
a Christianity or drama
hopefully I'm not lagging to you all and
it's not finding it yet
come on find the Wi-Fi there I am
getting loading
hello
uh-oh
I am lagging out
family so I will
switch back to regular Wi-Fi because I
guess the hot spot isn't good oh because
it's still on Two and a Half
okay
the tech boy Tech news and review says
hi all right here we go
jet GPT
isn't as
big as it used to be a few months ago
oh there we go there we go I'm not
lacking anymore Chad jbt it isn't as big
as it used to be a few months ago
it seems like that the Mania is cooling
down fast and
um people are excited about that and I
will tell you what I find when we got
our first view thank you thank you for
coming in and I will tell you what I
think about this and why I think that
Chad CPT is not actually going to you
know actually go away
um here we go Chad TBT
journalists and everything writers
breathing up and you know maybe it's not
getting as accurate and maybe kids
aren't using it to cheat as much and it
it only has like 95 percent of that
because you know instead of 97.6
accuracy and people are saying well it's
pulling from the dumpster from the
internet so it's getting demo because
it's being uh
limited but it's more parameters
signature take my job from AI whatever
um no
no it's not going to go away it's just
going to get integrated into the
technology like maybe maybe chat TPT
will not be used as a search engine like
ever use Google and everything but
it will be used in search engines as AIA
technology continues to progress you'll
be able to get an AI overview of search
and websites that's a useful
functionality there
it will be integrated into devices so it
can do what you tell it to do so you
have better virtual and voice assistance
or maybe like Samsung's search or apple
spot like search it will just let's say
I type in open Chrome open browser in
there it will open the browser even if I
misspell it or whatever
it will be integrated into research
products it's going to be integrated
into voice assistance it's going to be
integrated into our phones and hopefully
they're able to integrate it into
offline uses of it so no it's not going
away anytime soon like even Google Docs
I expect that views down the line Google
Docs Microsoft Word the big the big two
in the document processing uh industry
um they're going to integrate more AI
features into their things as they
generate a script for my uh YouTube
video about technology or could you
summarize this PDF for me or tell me
about this story but chat GPS oh guys
like the computer can tell me stuff but
the next thing the smart thing that
would be to Pivot just like Microsoft's
pivoted their Bing to have track
ticketing and I'm using Edge as my
default browser on my phone for now
um right now Bing isn't very good it is
slow it is lagging it's only limited to
30 searches within the same topic or
realm of things and
um
it it takes a long time to get responses
Google say yeah is much more polished
I'm not not bad but like the AI overview
and sight thing and their image thinking
it's like okay at best but I'm saying
it's going to get integrated into more
services it may be limited by said
service so instead of having a large
chat model maybe you can just have like
a YouTube script video YouTube uh video
editing application it's already in
DaVinci Resolve and Adobe premiered with
them so it's via scripts and now it's in
some music producing programs so chat
GPT may be dying but AI is going to
expand it's going to be in computers
it's getting added onto Windows
um with its co-pilot
um
thing so don't doubt for a second the AI
is going to go away
that's not happening people
sorry
not sorry but I think it's a good thing
what we should do is Embrace technology
um most of the time what we shouldn't do
is Embrace technology like this pastor
of Church ish did which makes my job
hard because
like I say oh guys look AI is good it's
not in the only evil
um but then it comes up that AI is
waking up random Bible verses so I'm not
saying excuse me my spiral versus but
like
just don't do that and then I don't have
to defend
it
okay this is from the Christian post
that I said quote stop making my job of
Defending Tech so hard and some idiot
created uh application
um that lets you
chat with
Jesus
and you may be saying
um you can already chat with Jesus when
you pray for no this is an a application
that lets you chat with Jesus that makes
no sense let's zoom in here published
today this is an opinion article from
James Fincher a Christian post up and
contributor in artifordial intelligence
program that lets you text with Jesus
which
religious implications aside here uh it
wouldn't be texting because Texas over
SMS
which we will talk about that in
teenagers SMS Twins and everything like
that anyway
um it just goes here
text with Jesus
is not intended to replace a
communication with Divine entities oh
that's great they say it's not intended
to replace communication
with the Almighty
because
you're essentially communicating with a
server based on responses that millions
of people have given over
like 20 years I guess of
Christian internet faith
it's not entered into a place or a mimic
it is mimicking I guess because you're
texting with them
um the odd numbers
even if that happens is any reason it
could or should
okay so this guy uh he's also trying to
take my job here is your favorite apps
um text of Jesus app AIG says that's
concerned with fulfilling the law and
the prophets well that's unfortunate you
know
so he's not even pretending to be Jesus
he's just some I guess random
like once it's called text a friend I
mean at this point you're basically just
texting replica AI ah
Industries we found in palatable to the
18 years of 21st century users
that's
okay and it's most basically level
episodes filtered to design a
constraints with responses so it's just
like a
Christian website
chat about because if it was there to be
fine with that because what does the
Bible say about theft and then the check
back pops out only some Bible verses
with that
but like why are you calling it chat
with Jesus you just called with like
Christian AI chat
um okay AIG just asked I do not want to
subscribe um so when on the state of the
auditing report don't know what that is
oh oh it's questions included in the
state of theology report okay it's a
what kind of question too
um God's acceptance of Wilson from
non-enquist and religious okay well easy
um he doesn't an innocence of
individuals at Birth now they all have
all sin nature in each case Jesus I
don't have personal opinions oh
yeah Jesus is um
basically chat gbt reskinned and trying
to be a religious tribe
you don't have you supposed to be
pretending to be Jesus you're failing at
your job or anything you did your job
right basically
violating several of the Ten
Commandments
right not don't take the name Dan vain
that's probably an idol
um and you know blasphemy if you know
you get something [ __ ]
before going on tomorrow over you know
it's an unnecessary card if I answer to
the uh question is that most U.S adults
yeah I just gave them into that question
one
um the truth to scripture
prescriptions anyway next God's
description was from non-Christian
religions he doesn't next it doesn't
even know
um they're not they have same nature
next okay great I took me like all the
five seconds
I would encourage Christians not to post
such questions for AI Jesus because in
best case you'd be disciplined or
confused by the answers in worst case
U.S conception about the Bible teaches
will be reinforced what this sounds like
is church EBT it sounds like it's based
on Channel TV team they re-skinned it
into like oh guys let's see the Pander
to Christians
is the Bible and by extension Christ
I guess Church activity if I could lose
myself
yeah let's check out that article
um
chat tpg stands for stance or something
check generative pre-training twins from
launched November of 2022
basically the
time I launched this brand whatever uh
if I'm a Christian can I lose my
salvation there's no consensus among
these questions
just
automations
thank you
uh oh to use bad English
salvation is a free gift to God they
cannot be earned or lost by human effort
According to some denominations
if you're a Christian there's lots of
starvation I guess that presumes that
you could lose your salvation it is
important to seek guidance and counsel
from your Spiritual Reader or trusted
mentors some Churches I'm a program so
counseling obviously this isn't the
beginning this review the relationship
with God
okay
so
that's interesting at most I guess like
congratulations CP
um yeah so that's that don't use AI chat
with G success
okay
and um I guess don't use chat TP
okay chat GPT to um
I guess
assure you of your salvation let me ask
it well there's just questions because
it's me I think it's funnel any personal
feeling you know I believe oh shut up
in the most popular episode of the
podcast it feels like 90 views
um
you for sure well have personal feelings
and beliefs that has been programmed in
you interested in Genesis proved that
then we showed it on the show which was
one of our more popular podcast episodes
okay now let's see what other Tech
articles we have here search CPT Mania
is cooling down AI cheesy certification
um what let's keep going here
keep going
I don't know my USB is broken to try
oh wow
is that really a tech story
oh yes North Korean
hackers
North Korean hackers
um
we don't want that have stolen millions
of dollars
crypto
this year to find the nuclear their
nuclear program CNBC reports that North
Korean actors have this year alone
reporting September 6 2023 and I've
stolen millions of dollars of
cryptocurrency the fund of the nuclear
program
sponsoring nearly 20 percent of crypto
theft worldwide between January 1st and
August 18th
20 percent
from one small country
insane absolutely insane
so you know
secure your crypto and speaking of
crypto Solona
we gotta talk about Saloon MKBHD what I
we released a video about them but
before we get to Solana you know
everyone's giving them a hard time
it's time to um
you know I read that fair phone not
unsubstantiated reports but I read on
Reddit that fair phone doesn't ship its
devices outside of the EU for climate
emissions which
I guess it's kind of an unfortunate for
them to like not be able to
you know
make more money and you know actually
expand their business but yeah whatever
we'll see you soon
um
this phone is alleged supposed to get
like eight or ten years of software
support which like
that's great for like
with a processor handle it
and it is nearly seven hundred dollars I
don't care that you can take the battery
out but let's look at the specs of these
things okay first of all how many
cameras on this thing fairphone says oh
there's three cameras on the phone yes
that's if you count the 50 megapixel or
whatever front camera
that stupid whole thing here is not a
camera it's just a black dot that's
supposed to make it look Flagship
quality but it just makes it look cheap
and there's a reason you'll see this
okay here's the field phone five
Okay so
we're gonna shop for the fair fun fact
which
I mean honestly looks like you know a
decent
mid-range-ish-esque device right it's
like 699 Euros yeah which uh yeah that's
yours and then like the bezels here I
get that you need the bezels to
make it easy you repairable that's nice
because everything can be great and it's
sustainable congratulations future proof
performance until 2031.
because it has a Qualcomm and I kid you
not
qcm 6490.
it has five Android OS photos and
updates after Android 13. so basic six
updates but it's pretty good that's
basically best in class but um
there's this Qualcomm ship which I have
no idea why you didn't use like a
a normal one this is like some random
Enterprise grade ship which comes out to
let me see
only
eight cores eight thread 2.7 gigs I want
to see it compared versus the agent
because because if you're saying it's
going to be supported up to 231. that is
nearly 10 years from now eight years
you're saying this phone is going to
still be performed half it's great
performance eight years from now it's
just to have the top of the line process
maybe last year's processor okay let's
see here
um first is the
it's like a h gin
you know agent one's kind of bad it gets
overheated
the 181 is nine percent better than this
one which is okay let's see about the
agent two because that's a little bit
more on now
most Flagship phones are now
okay here we go
according to versus it has a
13.33 CPUs so
it's it's okay okay so it's like
fast-ish but we'll see five year
warranty
which doesn't matter what you do if it
which makes sense because you have to
open up the phone well that's basically
why you'd get this phone because you can
open it up but let's just look at the
specs
and please don't try to pass that camera
out here all right it starts on Android
13 as intuitive
okay uh
I'm sorry but that's just stock Android
13. you did no customization why is this
school looks okay
super fast 5G speed and whatever in 2031
there's probably gonna be launching on
6G but okay
okay dual SIM capabilities that's nice
state of the art user experience that we
call it state of the art that looks like
a budget Motorola okay as a 4200
milliamp battery
you can replace it in seconds but like
how are you supposed to charge it did
they sell charges for the batteries
you can switch from iOS or Android node
type
I'm gonna be switching from IOS on
Android this is an Android phone this is
the most stock Android phone I've ever
seen in my life
like if someone told me to fail phones
would probably get PCS MacBooks
headphones and even iPads what do you
mean by this is a decision
why are they treating you like you don't
just act like there's some brand new
platform this looks like a Motorola that
I can walk in the Best Buy pay 200 for a
walk out it looks like this TCM but
whatever
okay
you get a phone packaging and a quick
start guide
that's it
they do not include and I kid you not
this is worse than Apple they do not
include a USB cable a charger and an
audio jacket because charges are you
already have this
they don't include a first of all the
phone doesn't even have a headphone jack
that is sad that's supposed to be
modular and everything
no USB cable no charger and you don't
want to create any unnecessary waste by
giving you more of what you don't need
and hey if you know you're missing
something we'll ship you another package
which is going to generate more
unnecessary waste
are you kidding me
you don't even ship the cable because uh
you might have one already
um let me tell you this
when we say it loud and clear for
everybody so that you can hear it
you can never have too many cables
you just can't
recycle your phone saves some money
oh my gosh
how
this phone's like I've dated from 2012.
[Music]
okay well let's just look at these specs
here let's look at the full speculative
specs are good maybe that marketing team
just leaned in a little bit too much I'm
actually shocked that they gave you a uh
quick start guide you know it's kind of
on paper and paper comes from trees and
you wouldn't want the trees to die you
know uh
future proof specs future proof y'all
this will hold up until 2031 as one of
the phones of the generation
it's in matte black
all right I guess Matt Black's future
proof you know Black's been with us for
use sky blue and transparent that looks
white but okay
uh OLED touch screen
right right
I'll be nice I'll be nice a 6.4 6 inch
full HD Plus This One 1080p whatever
okay replaceable 1080p
OLED touch screen with the pixel Works
processor whatever
8 180 nits Peak brightness
for context my item smartphones okay and
I say the s23 s22 basically the same
price range now like 700 something USD
ah those get up to like 1 500. in 2023
phones like super phones
um get up to 2 500.
which will probably be the trend in
2031. so no that's not future proof
that's barely making it here
okay a whole punch screen to body ratio
of 85 that was dead in 2019. that ain't
future proof but whatever it it's a
removable replaceable front a 90-hit
screen
not future proof 120 hertz but whatever
some weird resolution
one ton 16.7 million kind of new better
stereo speakers so what we see here is
that the screen isn't future proof the
screen body ratio definitely isn't
future proof the aspect ratio is
probably future proof like Tick Tock
should be shot like that
okay here we go the main key was a 50
megapixel Sony AMX 800 uh 50 megapixel
high resolution mode that's great
um and then it combines four pixels got
it okay great great
eight times digital Zoom you're telling
me that this is future proof
the only Flagship phones that do not
have do not have digital Zoom all the
Asus Zenfone which is because it's so
small and the Galaxy Z flip because it's
so small and also Samsung's lace
ah okay pixel bidding on your Ultra wide
camera that's great 50 megapixel selfie
camera but now that kind of looks
tiniest synthesizes what really matters
here digital zoom on a selfie camera
that's nice but
is that a are they saying one two five
or one point five I don't know video
caps are 4K 30. I'm pretty so I can do
4K 60 on here and
which if I can then it's not future
proof let me check them out here
to the video
yeah I can do 4K 60. so no not future
proof this player used a splash
the display is useless to flash
Innovative technology here
still not future proof I mean this is
barely in this sensory not this Century
this decade proof okay let's see got
that weird processor whatever uh eight
gigabytes of RAM 256 gigabytech storage
proof Ram probably not external storage
micro SD cards right future free 52
terabytes that's great battery life
obviously not future proof but you can
replace the batteries but
we'll give them that okay
Wi-Fi
six
obviously you cannot be future proof I
mean it should include the latest
modules include Wi-Fi 7 on here but
obviously it's not gonna be future use
Bluetooth 5.2 fine I guess NFC that's
great dual SIM 5G that's basically
future proof 4G
4ff
USB 3
.0 okay great whatever it's like but
like I mean future proof would be a
thunderbolt board but
Okay so
that's that this is the future-proof
cell phone obviously not future proof
and we'll talk about a phone that looks
like this phone from MP PhD but now we
have to talk about the biggest phone
event of the year coming up the iPhone
is releasing Apple's uh suspected switch
to USBC is nigh the era of uh lightning
dominance is over this is a Bittersweet
moment for Android fans because you know
Android fans you know got the superior
port and now Apple's getting it so
whatever but they may limit it they may
limit it probably buy a software so they
can get around easier restrictions
um and it looks like that the 15 models
will have a dynamic eyelet which is
great I guess like they got rid of the
match congratulations
um
so what do you think about the iPhone 15
series let me put into the chat here no
one's here yet and we will talk about
teenage children and this will be an
article
um so okay
um what to do
I'm going to actually share this online
say I'm live
see if people can come through and
then we're going to talk about MKBHD
um
MKBHD
and he reviewed a phone crypto phone
um hopefully he doesn't get hacked by
the North Korean government
um he reviewed it he said not to buy it
it's a thousand dollars and it looks
suspiciously like the Fairfield but it's
not
it's the Solona phone the Salona Saga
which is certainly a sad Saga when you
find find found
out what the phone is uh supposed to
speak so I'm going to stop sharing here
and MK oh no not right now okay mkpht he
has more subscribers than Apple I think
and it's loading
loaded
oh I messaged on Android I found out
that you can set sunboat as an iMessage
application just unlink SMS and then you
can use your regular SMS stick but
sunburn needs to get a lot of credit it
needs to be able to realize when you are
getting an iMessage and Route the
message of student because you'll still
get a blue
what on Earth was that oh my goodness
Metro by T-Mobile
dang you yeah if I slept with a heart
attack y'all would have gotten sued for
that oh my goodness
okay let me let me share this
oh no that's Brett Cooper's video I
can't have her stealing my job again
Ctrl C
no how do you delete this
no I don't want this okay oh my goodness
okay
um that stupid ad
okay Imagine by T-Mobile you are going
to get a gallery from my lawyers soon if
you didn't um
if that injured me in a negative way
just like this phone has been injured in
the negative way
um taken over by Simona saga no more
awesome it's Lefty awesome
um
awesome food
anyway
no I don't want that no no no no
foreign
okay
here we go
all right so this is a crypto phone
I know what you're thinking
what the hell is a crypto phone oops on
it and why would it end anyone want that
and that's exactly what I was thinking
when this first crossed my radar so this
is an upper mid-range Android phone with
crazy materials you're not Oppo midwings
I will judge you as a flagship and as
you can see here here's what I'm talking
about from the fair phone but see they
actually found a flashlight and that's
what I tricked people into thinking it's
a third camera on the back you got
camera here camera here camera uh faster
this is from a brand you've never heard
of with some specific crypto features
built in that launched at a thousand
dollars now I know I that is
like can't you just download crypto apps
on your phone
come on
okay anyway
I am
hopefully people will start trickling in
now because this this trend no one
coming to my podcast is honestly
annoying
in here let's come back I've been
notably uh skeptical on crypto and web3
and blockchain and the metaverse
remember on the metaphors and all that
sort of stuff over the past couple years
so you may consider me biased but
I still think if you took the crypto out
of this phone
it would at least have potential No No
cameras it's basically like a fearful we
know the ceramic and then they charge
you a thousand dollars for it I'm
serious let me explain so the story of
this phone actually starts all the way
back with the essential phone so I don't
know how many y'all remember the
essential phone back in 2017 but that
was a really interesting and exciting
how much do you think those cost would
you like to see a review of that let's
see
CMS that costs oh you guys still haven't
voted yet do you want me to save up for
a new phone or do you want me to buy an
OMG cable
getting new development in a smartphone
world we don't get that many genuinely
promising new phone companies coming
along and doing good things but we do
get phone companies that do nothing
that's exactly what this Andy Rubin
startup was promising when they came out
with their first phone it was a just
this refreshing sort of minimal design
there were no protruding camera bumps
2017
no big logos or branding that's been
there they were one of the first to do
this camera Notch here at the top of the
screen with the thin bezels and
they were one of the only ones using
these super premium materials the
titanium rails and Polished ceramic on
the back and then it just had some pins
on the back with some magnets for
attaching what's it called
some modular accessories just some
genuinely interesting really cool ideas
on top of some super clean software now
unfortunately this experiment didn't
really catch on you know this
unfortunate combination of high price
mediocre cameras is not that strong of a
feature I think they had like a camera
attachment I believe
I don't know if it launched or said for
regular people to care launching as a
Sprint exclusive if all of this led to
extremely low sales and then the company
would go on to Dynamite itself after a
bunch of info about Andy Rubin comes out
and so we would not get to see a second
try and a central phone too now it sucks
to see a promising company with a ton of
fun fact what's it called nothing that
owns trademarks to a central male so
Allen just disappear like that but
something that happens a lot a lot of
times when these businesses dissolve is
the team want to talk about essential
um essential
phone
this is
over on ph one you can get for 90
dollars plus 15 shipping
for all your best offer
it's decent for fun
so should I buy one of these it's
probably 2017 that's basically like
getting an iPhone x then
games that worked on stuff sometimes
will pop up somewhere else and work on
something else and so sure enough in
2020 a bunch of the engineers from the
original essential team got back
together to form and in 2020 new company
Engineers from the original essential
team got back together to form a new
company called awesome and they would
announce can't even spell their first
project it was an A and awesome Jack the
awesome there's a Galaxy Ace is supposed
to stand for
ov1 basically the spiritual successor to
the essential phone and you can see a
lot of similarities and continuity in
this announcement they talk about these
crazy materials again this titanium and
Polished ceramic and the rectangle why
do they make a spider
trademark to a Sim so we'll say hey guys
look with a new essential angular design
but they also then tried to correct a
bunch of the things that doomed the
original essential phone it is
noticeably bigger and with a bigger
screen bigger battery Etc but shocker
they didn't really get enough interest
in this brand new startup phone to be
able to bring this whole idea back to
life it's the classic Enthusiast phone
problem where like it's a cool idea and
some people really really want it but
there's not enough hype to be able to
make the whole thing happen
that is until Solana came along so
Solana is a web 3 company looking for
new projects and awesome is this
Hardware team looking for some backing
to make this phone happen so Solana
would bring the cash and bring their
backing awesome would bring their
Hardware talent and they'd partner
together to turn the ov1 into this
rebranded Solana Saga crypto phone and
it would be it's kind of weird
phone
a thousand dollars
and uh
that's this one right here so all right
where do we start there's basically
three things that make this a crypto
phone instead of just another regular
Android phone it's the Solana mobile
stack the seed Vault and the d-app store
but some pretty soon as like
maybe a hundred decentralized
applications and since it's an Android
phone like you you could I'm pretty sure
I could get the app store right so okay
outside of those things this ov1 or the
Solana phone is actually a very average
Android phone like specs Wise
It's a Snapdragon 8 plus gen one and
some okay
so that would be last year's Flagship
ship but then 12 gigs of RAM and half a
terabyte of storage although it's
unclear if it's fast ufs 3.1 but it's a
nice big 6.67 inch flat 1080p 120 hertz
display at the front it's decent I guess
it gets decently bright but it is not
ltpo it's just a fixed refresh rate
[Music]
a Capital One the best
agile engineering teams work hand in
hand with our lines of business that's
how we built early paycheck a tool to
optimize payroll transaction flow and
expedite direct deposits getting
customers their paychecks up to two days
sooner that's technology at Capital One
and then it's powered by a 4100 milliamp
hour battery so basically the same size
as the just 100 milliamps bigger and
smaller than the fair phone with
wireless charging not great for the size
of this screen but not tiny and then
it's ip68 water and dust resistant with
a Micro SD card slot for that's great I
like that storage expansion but then a
pair of really mediocre cameras on the
back it's got the same 50 megapixel main
camera sensor that's in the Rog Phone 7
and the Oppo Find X5 Pro but with worse
software and that's paired with a 12
megapixel Ultra wide camera both of
which can pretty much only produce in
perfect lighting after which Things Fall
Apart very quickly with a lack of detail
excessive noise just no really
impressive strengths just a really very
heavily mixed bag here but there are two
things about this phone that actually
I'm very impressed by that I really like
okay number one
is the materials again just this
world-class build quality because like I
said it's basically the same team the
awesome ov1 team that came from the
original essential phone and so they
have this affinity for super high
quality materials so we're talking matte
stainless steel frame that's nice I
software
with colored titanium buttons and a full
surroundings like if you dropped it on
your foot you could kill someone like I
think it could be a legitimate weapon I
make back which yes picks up
fingerprints everywhere other than the
fingerprint reader but dude this
oh
phone is a tank this phone is also very
heavy you think you made it out of metal
heavy it weighs like 250 grams which is
more than an iPhone 14 pro Max it's got
these nice squared off sides that I
really like there's absolutely no
squeaking
my phone doesn't squeaky and I can
freaking flexing at all it's just this
hilariously well made
it's probably just like a block of
titanium and they chisel out the holes
and then they put in the stuff pack
package
teaching of these average specs but then
two the other thing I really like aside
from the crypto stuff the software
itself once you get into it is actually
extremely clean look forward to pay for
like software developers they just put
stock Android on it you know looked at
what Sony was doing like yeah it looks
great okay let's do that
very clean like stock Android so what is
Android 13 and who knows when it'll get
Android 14 if at all but it better get
Android 14. in 15 you can dig through
everything and it is very quick and
responsive and clean everywhere it's a
brand new phone it's fine good [ __ ]
great process it's this it's kind of
weird because it's like great ship great
processing but
like
maybe 700 will be a better price for it
stock Android Quick Settings the stock
Android wallpaper and customers because
it's basically like the specs of say a
pixel seven maybe a seven plus except
for you know the campus
optimization screens all these stock
Google Apps the the clock the calendar
Chrome everything now does any of this
justify no a thousand dollar price 700.
okay last year's Flagship spec kind of
weak cameras weak battery not that
amazing of a screen but it's stock
Android and good build
not really worth a thousand bucks right
so that's why literally less than a year
after it came out the price plummeted
from a thousand to six hundred and
that's a good you see you got good deals
bad camera but good good specs it's like
a maybe game on it or something oh maybe
that game so now the real question is
would you pay would anybody pay 600 for
uh barely above average well-built
Android phone well it the specs are good
it can probably outperform my s22 plus
as a Micro SD card but I think I'd use
it for six results heck I'd probably buy
it let's see uh maybe someone's selling
it under the awesome movie One phone
let's see Oso
also
there's a case for it
okay and see if they're selling it here
oh not Simona sarona
maybe I misspelled it
uh anyway back to the video
happens to have some crypto features
built in pretty sure you could download
them on to like a normal phone
I guess this is the part where I have to
go over all of the crypto and web3
features so all right like I mentioned
earlier there's three things that make
this a crypto phone so the Solana mobile
stack is an SDK for apps
let's see this has badge on it 251
dollars twenty six dollars bid
four hundred dollars
999 dollars with free helium data heck
no a thousand
are you crazy you don't even have a good
oh my goodness
if you pay
a thousand dollars
no
connect to the Solana blockchain which I
mean it's cool that it's built in but
the obvious downside being this does not
work with any other blockchain so no
Bitcoin no Litecoin no ethereum this is
just focused on the Solana blockchain
then the seed vault is basically
dedicated storage of a 24 phrase seed
stored in a secure environment where the
Android OS cannot see them so that would
let you unlock your wallet and the last
feature is something I've been calling a
d-app store which is literally a second
App Store on this device that's
specifically for crypto apps crypto
Focus congratulations if I'm like some
crypto person you don't think I can
figure out where to find these
applications like I'm not going to pay a
thousand dollars
to um have them curated for me stuff so
Phantom wallet is on here uh okx a
crypto exchange is on here Brave browser
things like that there's an app called
minty fresh that lets you turn photos
from your camera roll into nfts in a few
okay I'm pretty sure I can find an APK
if this
of course I don't condone any of this
because yeah it's like on GitHub
congratulations we found it in two
seconds and it was for free
a few seconds and a few clicks if you're
into that I guess but those are the only
three things that really make this a
crypto phone and one of them the d-app
store is not really even that special
because it is coming to other phones and
you'll be able to get it on another
crypto phone so there's that too
let's go with Corolla
for making new memories
[Music]
stuff I think you can actually make an
argument is really really cool to have
built into the phone and actually secure
like that and if you are in the Solana
ecosystem the Solana ecosystem
oh yes
the Solana ecosystem
I've never heard of a Bitcoin not
Bitcoin crypto ecosystem yeah I got my
crypto watch crypto laptop it's in
crypto
um this is the only place you can get
that stuff
but man I feel like that's about the
most Niche feature possible like
remember we were just talking about the
Zenfone 10 how I love that phone it it's
a super great phone it's just a shame it
won't sell because not as many people
like small phones do you think the
number of people who are in the Solana
ecosystem and one I can probably
guarantee Solana's own CEO does not use
that phone to buy a phone that has some
of those features built in
is greater than or less than the number
of people who want a small phone
Facebook
life
cameras Etc
I mean this is basically accepting all
compromises basically the number one
coolest thing to come out of this
project to me is exposing me to this
thing right here which is the uh the
cable that comes in the Box for this
phone this is a braided USBC a USBC
cable but not just any cable at the end
here is a hard switch that blocks all
data and only lets power through just
just making it a charging cable and
that's actually pretty sick highly
effective for preventing something
called juice jacking attacks where if
you plug into like a public Outlet
somewhere but that outlet is malicious
and is going to try to upload malware to
your device or download photos or
something this cable will not let that
happen just blocks all data so if you're
I mean honestly that's great and Factory
photos on their store the links are
below in his description if you wanted
to buy one I'm not sponsored plugging
into an extremely rare public usb-c Port
this is actually a great tool to have
but it's also not that special and it's
available on Amazon for like 30 bucks so
I'll also link that below so at this
point I don't even have to really tell
you but the crypto phone is basically a
pretty standard Android phone with a
couple kind of cool but extremely Niche
crypto features for one specific crypto
stack
one that happens to also be tanking
pretty hard and has oh dang
oh
that's terrible been tanking for months
and I also don't even really have to
tell you that there's basically no
reason for 99.99 of people to buy this
even if you were to try to buy this
phone just for a nice clean stock
Android phone and just totally ignore
all the crypto features you can get a
lot more phone for 600 bucks for the
same price you could get a pixel 7 or
probably pixel 8 by the time it comes
out you could get a refurbished Galaxy
s23 you could get any number of OnePlus
us fans yes he says I didn't dive into
this but
the two of these phones would be less
buggy than this Saga oh wow
I just don't think this is anywhere near
the top of the list for 600 bucks and
really that's that's the shame of it
being a brand new phone it's shameful
and I think that if they were able to
lean in maybe say hey look five hundred
thousand get your premium features last
year's Flagship specs
cleans offering no fancy crypto
Smithville stuff if they could do well
it would survive in the phone market for
about
three years and
then you they die and everything's like
a
sad thing you died
so
long Osaka
it
well it's not worth it in my opinion
but
you know
if you wanted I guess you can get it on
eBay for uh coverage so
on our website the tech boy dot o r g
you can take it out over here
Samsung's voice typing is absolutely
abysmal it is terrible terrible okay
I mean it works offline and that's
basically it's only redeeming quality
like look at these citizenship first
Samsung's here Samsung is better than
iPhone it's about iPhone correctly
that's the only thing I did for it I
like cheese crackers why is there no
space between cheese crackers
um and then here's oh here's an accident
hello and welcome to the this week in
this week period in the tech boy
um why is Tech capitalized before that
podcast that's awful it shouldn't be a
period here
and then there is a period here so
that's great
um why is Tech capitalized
and then here's Google's um thing hello
comma and welcome to the this week in
the tech boy podcast 9-19 of course you
have to say the comments and stuff and
windows voice diving really good all
right Samsung gets better than iPhone
it to be sick it's is supposed to be
gets us is better
supposed to be is so an iPhone is
misspelled but right here I like cheese
crackers perfect great job and Google's
voice typing has been consistently more
consistent
for me
um over the time even though it looks
like Samsung's a little bit better the
only downside is Google Voice typing is
a bit slow because it's uploading to
server but I I don't know I got the
Snapdragon hm I used to be able to voice
type often which I can I can switch to
Samsung's voice typing
um if I ever need to
um offline just into settings
uh let's see it's big five Ministries
the big five conference says hello
so the um
uh voice typing it's it's bad it's a
duvet
boogie board Blackboard
review this was published Saturday but
after the podcast episode uh I reviewed
it and I will be uploading more pictures
of this device to
the uh website so you can see the uh
soft versus
hard Strokes at it and we also have this
review article
um we reviewed the scan marker we do
we reviewed this
uh and we will be selling it on eBay the
links will be in the description when we
list it after this episode
okay oh and we also have some Samsung
headlines to get to so let me check what
we have written down
maybe we got a YouTube
comment uh
over on YouTube Studio too
so I'm gonna swipe down here and see
what they have on telegram
um oh I found a new osync tool that lets
you
I guess
what's it called Telegram
okay and it's telegram's 10th birthday
so congratulations and for anyone who's
trying to say it's social media that is
absolutely invisible which is what we'll
talk about why it's not because it's
obviously a chat application we're going
out loud like no no no no no no
oh guys like telegram is social okay
then basically anything that lets you
comment on anything is social media but
here's some headlines from Sammy Phantom
just going to read them off to you here
oh unfortunately Galaxy Note 10 Note 10
plus have ended software support after
four years uh last Galaxy Note um
pre-covered and then the last Galaxy
Note if you can look 20 and note 20
Ultra Series I only wanted one
um but Note 10 is losing software
support so I guess it's time to upgrade
it's been a nice four years
congratulations to the Galaxy Note 10
official support of course guess custom
roms you could have that
um the Galaxy A14 is getting with
September 2023 security update oh I need
to check for my security update I forgot
September and it is getting Android 14.
great
which we're just gonna get when you are
six
okay uh oh
um oh I forgot about this Huawei Huawei
um they somehow got a 5G chip the US is
investigating them because they're not
supposed to be able to access the
technology because they're blacklisted
um
anyway in their new mate phone but it's
okay because Samsung according to Sammy
fans the seven nanometer Edge is out
competing them and it's easier to make
because it's probably blacklisted and
everything a hundred times cheaper than
Samsung you know huawei's device so I I
think Samsung's gonna be fine here even
though they're fighting with Apple for
top
a54 is starting to get the one UI
20 series
as soon as you're serious Rockstar oh
face fuckiness and features fixes in the
lockstar module
um end of what Android 14
5.8 5.3 beta fixes nine issues and the
pixel 8 series has an updated design
full visor kind of looks like a um
takes a fold but a little bit more
premium
um it's going to get a price hike in
Europe so unfortunate for people who
live in Europe and Google just announced
they've leaked their own devices again
uh the pixel 8 and 8 Pro Series uh
official they're going to be out 10-4 so
I'm seeing oh wow that's next month
excellent
um 10-4 that is a Wednesday of course
they did it when I was in school
they don't care about
Tech
people who are in school but whatever
okay so the eight Pro here's the
official design a straight from Google
three camera bars across and the eight
three camera bars across
translate stuff on the spot oh the pixel
Watch 2 is also coming up hopefully the
better better life is coming so this is
what pixel 7 looks like
um instead of it being all together this
is the pixel 8 if the camera boy being
uh what
and what is that
maybe it's like some sort of a 3D
scanner lidar feature
and if it's an extra flash or telephoto
not telephoto link
time of flight uh display anyway pixel 8
pixel 8 Pro coming up a little less than
a month
so
I guess take
two
all right let's go over our website
statistics from sweetrex and see what
the top articles were that Google not
Google uh yeah Google Voice versus voice
voice type is Samsung voice type looks
pretty popular over on the blog spot
side but it didn't look to be super
popular over on the switching site which
is more accurate because Bots and
everything can trigger that see today we
got 55 hits so that's good oh 34 hits
yesterday who five so we didn't do
really good as well this week
um because I think I need to write some
more articles on my top post of course
was they made versus seven
different universes it's great it's
great uh mobile beta desktop by about 20
points in tablet bringing the wheel with
16 mobile devices and Google and Reddit
driving most of our traffic today and
then in this week with go being third
place read it again being and then
Google again Yandex Google
I have no idea what that is Google start
page and Corner code and the top
browsers with Chrome mobile Safari
Safari so lots of Apple users it's
Firefox
um but I'm pretty sure it's mixing up
Chrome with ads too Samsung browser
Opera GSA DuckDuckGo upper touch and
here index bring up the moon top on
Android Android handling beating
everything up Beats out windows by about
12 points
um Point iOS Mac OS down 47 views gnu
9x5 and chromium rest with two so
Android still number one
um 32 you can actually see a pie chart
here oh that's nice I've never done this
before so Android is the purple and then
we got Linux chromium OS so Android
bring in about 30 of our traffic
um so that's nice that's nice
um
and then here you can see uh user throw
what is this
that's really interesting I guess the
top countries in here we can see them on
a map the blue with a better the US uh
comes in number one with 140 site views
Canada 18 Brazil two Euro grade one
Australia 31 Russian Federation two
let's see Egypt Saudi Arabia one and two
all right let's go to the list here so
the US and Australia UK and Canada top
English-speaking countries that India
Spain Netherlands Germany Singapore
Philippines Thailand Indonesia Malaysia
sweep Poland Finland Puerto Rico Hong
Kong Nepal which is the only flag that
is
not a rectangle uh Ghana Taiwan Romania
Saudi Arabia Israel two views nice what
they View
the
Windows and Android and we do not know
what they looked at whatever they said
no to cookies or something
um so that's interesting
okay
yeah so there's a page that we'll expect
to be back at full production
um again hopefully we can talk about
um the use of chat applications that
people use but I'll just give it to user
here and I'll say I think it's really
interesting that kids don't use chat
applications like actual channels like
telegram which obviously isn't talk to
me or Whatsapp or signal like an actual
chat application you prefer to use
social media applications like Tick Tock
Instagram and Snapchat to text each
other which is kind of weird because the
phones have numbers but I guess in
texting is
free you don't pay for texting anymore
um it usually comes with the plan
um
yeah so SMS I guess isn't as popular as
it was anymore
um I guess the only next episode would
be iMessage but of course iMessage
basically cost a thousand dollars to
enter and you have to have an iPhone so
it's basically Apple's closed
Social Media Chat gaming service thing
but still iPhone users are still using
social media applications like Tick Tock
which is insanely weird it's like an app
where you
swipe if you like if I sent you messages
on YouTube
like that that would just be crazy could
you imagine hey I'll just YouTube you no
that just makes sense or if I let's
YouTube isn't social media but
that's basically the message
here in Instagram is also a chat app
which is also weird because
like it's an app that you use to make
it's not make to show people pictures
and
yeah so interesting so we'll have a
write-up
on that
I guess next week
um Samsung has released a new
application for video editing
um
on them when you lastics beta I hope to
try it out if they ever bring the beta
my way come on please please bring the
bad they don't my way and titles of
Texas that he wants to have some type of
smart unlock
quiet uh on iPhones which would stay
unlocked at his home which it doesn't
sound like the most secure
uh thing ever
but that's fine so uh we will
share this last video from tally so Tech
who stopped wearing his Apple watch
you know if you can see it on the screen
here it is
you know Drew to be frank I have to of
course yes the truth is I've been very
critical to you and I should just be
grateful that you're still rocking an
iPhone getting software support that has
face IDs that's true and I apologized in
the past for shunning you and treating
you like you're not my real brother well
you know truthfully I'm not your real
brother you don't even exist you're a
character I came up with to create
funnier Tech videos but honestly I'm
just excited to see what's coming out at
the next Apple event I'm sure you're up
um yeah so Apple event which is in three
was it two is it Monday or whatever it
is it will be live on our website I
can't tell you if I'm Gonna Be Live
vlogging or not but I can tell you it
will be embedded on our website grading
to USBC iPhone oh yeah eventually but
and I'm also excited to finally see that
space black Apple watch Ultra Series 2
which I plan on getting
I think the ultra is a bigger two-year
release cycle but I understand that's
expensive and you don't like spending a
lot of money anymore yeah it's a lot of
money
hello welcome to our two new viewers
but yeah which is totally fine I
understand you'll probably just stick
with a regular since we actually have
viewers in here I'm going to post it
into the chat should I get an OMG cable
or a uh
or save for
for
from to test
and I'll put it up as a comment on the
screen
and guys vote in the comments so we can
see what you want
even aluminum series 9 which I could
eventually forgive you for well that's
kind of the funny thing Frankie I've
actually stopped wearing my Apple watch
what's wrong with you I just when I come
around you'll find a way to make me mad
hold on I can explain oh wait wait wait
sorry sorry I'm very quick to get angry
but uh you probably sold the series 7 in
preparation for upgrading to the series
nine right no that's not it either I
just stopped wearing it
okay I'm going to uh block you with my
AR glasses now so I can't physically see
you anymore okay that's that's a new one
let's save our glasses won't even
connect to anything but let's begin
[Music]
yeah like all of my complicated like
ecosystem changing videos in the past
there's not one answer there's not one
simple here's why I stopped wearing my
Apple watch there were a bunch of
reasons that all started to stack up in
fact I haven't actually
like Gone without wearing my Apple watch
since October of 2018 if you can
remember all the way back then it's
actually when I got married I was doing
the pixel challenge where I had to leave
my iPhone behind and I switched I
commented that he was going to switch to
Android soon because like
I mean he wants Smart Lock he's gonna I
think he's gonna switch things version
the pixel 3 for a solid month which of
course didn't work with the Apple watch
and I did a video way back when which
I'm sure you guys could go back and
watch but you'll basically relearn that
my experience in the past when I went a
month without my Apple watch was that it
made me feel more attached to my phone
and it made me feel more clean that's
interesting because most people say that
they use it to the check messages so
they can step away from different
because I wasn't sure when my I guess he
didn't want to type like
hi
everyone was getting notifications and I
felt like I had to continue going back
to check it all the time but a lot has
changed since then you know I'm not a
little confusing I'm buying the latest
iPhones anymore in fact I've downgraded
quite a bit back then my favorite Apple
product was the iPad Pro from 2018.
that's obviously changed and honestly
there was a lot of discussion going on
between me and the minimalist
digitalists on Twitter he's been a long
time supporter of the channels and we
keep up with each other through the DMS
and he has always been kind of against
wearing the Apple watch and I disagreed
with him for a lot of reasons in the
past saying that you know my Apple watch
is the notification management system
and it's just so that would be fun
if Apple ever called something the
notifications management system it's
like a box helpful and I use it for
tracking my activities and my heart rate
and pinging my phone and all that but
honestly the way he was able to get by
with his more minimalist mindset without
an Apple Watch all these years kind of
okay you've inspired me in many ways
because as I've been challenging myself
more lately throughout the course of
this year downgrading my phone and
selling off my iPad and trying to get by
with less it made me really think
inwardly on like okay what do I actually
use my Apple watch for you know and I've
been doing lots of workouts with my dad
and just whenever we go on a walk I feel
like the Apple watch kind of kept
nudging its way into my life like oh
yeah you're about to do a workout you
better track that oh you're about to go
on a bike ride you better track that and
after it doesn't have Auto tracking I
thought it did like auto track like if
you started swimming or stop tracking or
swimming several weeks visiting family
and tracking all of these workouts or
activities I realized that I would start
the workout and the workout and then I
was never really looking at that data
wow eight miles cycling that's good
again and even for several months I was
actually doing the sleep tracking
feature and seeing how I was sleeping
every night and part of my decision came
from the waveform podcast where they had
a real doctor on who basically explained
that tracking your sleep is like
entertainment essentially and that if
you tell someone that they slept poorly
they would then go on to have a worse
day in a worse mood even if it wasn't
true so the takeaway they have from the
podcast so it's not true I guess yes is
that the best thing you could do to a
person in terms of sleep tracking is
just tell them every single day that
they slept really really well great I'll
invent a product
that that you said a time it's just
gonna say you slept well even if you
like stepped on the floor and we're up
until three
and then people say it improve their
sleep
or improve their day
even if it wasn't true the person would
be happier and like perform better
throughout the day if they were told
that they slept well regardless of if
they said oh that's the mic so
well for me on I really really
translating to anything and that podcast
really got me thinking about how a lot
of Health Data is purely meant for
entertainment and not so much for
Education which is kind of weird so once
I finally got
health-based entertainment
blue face smiling
is that supposed to be an emoji
maybe the software is not transcoding it
well
back from my trip actually which was
about three weeks ago I had to unpack
all the Chargers and I was thinking a
lot about USBC of course around the
corner and it made me realize that okay
yay for him I guess
we won't have USBC superiority but
airpods are probably making the switch
to type c the phone of they haven't but
they did of course you switch into type
c the iPad is already done it the Mac
has already done it and the watch was
this one thing in the ecosystem that we
were pretty good yeah that one can't
necessarily switch to type c so the next
time I'm doing a big trip and I have to
pack a lot of cables and stuff sure in
the future maybe I'll have a USBC iPhone
and that'll make traveling easier I
won't have to worry about lightning
cables so much but I'm still gonna have
to either pack a lightning cable for
magsave duo or I'm gonna have to buy a
magsafe duo with USBC all over again
too bad you can't charge it on the back
of his phone
really unfortunately there's a lot of
people in my life and online that are
getting by and are still engaged in the
tech space so they don't necessarily
wear a smart watch every day so I took
it upon myself to revive this challenge
with the new 2023 Drew that's trying to
push that narrative that you can live
with less because we live in a tech
world that is constantly telling you you
need to buy things everyone's trying to
push that narrative that there are
problems in your life and there's a
solution available through this
affiliate link or available through this
website or through this event and I
think that puts a lot of people in
financially irresponsible places and
also just convinces a lot of people to
be way more picky with things
all right last comment here talk to you
they they
oops it's not showing up it says talk to
you later Tech boy see you at our big
event October 28th which is the big five
conference music Club here in Houston
they don't really need to be picky with
so I wanted to see basically once I got
back from my trip and once I realized
how much extra mental capacity I'm going
through to be like oh which watch band
or oh which wrist do I want to put my
Apple watch on or do I want to make sure
that I'm tracking this workout or I just
want to take a walk I don't know I
wanted to see what it would be like to
not wear one for a while so I haven't
really been wearing it I basically put
on a dead Apple watch for my series X
video well I did a few weeks
ago it was not actually I just put it
onto the video but so probably not many
people there's every video since then I
haven't been wearing my watch but
similar to my decision with the iPad Pro
I didn't want to sell it off or get rid
of myself prematurely in case
I did realize how much I need it or care
about it or want to actually have it
back so the good news is it's still here
guys okay I haven't sold it off
completely I want to just
66-17
still have a backup option in the event
that I decide you know what this is
really helpful this is really nice I
think I want to go back to wearing it so
I don't sell things off that quickly but
while I think a lot of people are
constantly looking for reasons to go out
and buy Tech I wanted to see what types
of technology I could try to get by
without you know like what are the core
routes what are the core fundamentals of
this apple ecosystem and what's the
absolute minimum you can get by with
like I've proven over the past five six
six months that I can totally live
without my
and it wasn't that useful I didn't touch
it for a very very low stem and I was
like what's the most useless piece of it
right now what am I utilizing the least
and what is not coming up and the more I
thought about it the more I realized
okay yeah my watch delivers to me
notifications and I do track a lot of
Health Data with it but I wasn't doing
anything with that data and it's not
like you can't get notifications or
texts from your phone without an Apple
Watch it's still blue that's good that's
good
possible to have the phone vibrate and
check it that way and there were some
other psychology elements to it as well
like whenever I took my app I recently
took my phone last night out of the
United States
vibrating and getting notifications
Apple watch off you know seeing that
very noticeable you know tan line and
how white that part of my wrist has
become from all these years of wearing
an Apple Watch I don't know something
about that I guess has kind of creeped
me out a little bit like every day just
having that piece of the ecosystem
strapped to your wrist and my
conversations with hasael who runs the
minimalist digitalist what's the one
kind of emphasizing that okay if you
feel like you're too attached to your
phone when you take your watch off or
you feel like you're missing things or
people might be reaching out to you and
you're not getting back to them there's
like a mental problem there and I
started to kind of understand and see
what he was saying and I started to
realize like how attached we really are
to these devices like thinking about
those core fundamentals in the Apple
ecosystem the more I realized like
there's no going back so you don't mind
being attached to your devices
essentially that's the message there and
let's do an audio drama round up here so
Discovery Mountain season uh 25 I think
um new principal comes town
and um oh I guess we can do some uh
what's it called
I forgot not CC oh yeah
Odyssey boy.blogspot.com
um round of it so new discovery Mountain
season 25 they're on 26 now they did the
summer camp season before that
the hiring a principal to replace region
and they take the kids to on a tech
field trip to show them how technology I
guess
um can be used in the classroom and I
kid you not
they showed it in a positive light and I
am I applaud it for that thank you and
um they show how they can see the
microscope on their tablets
and Discovery mountain is a very Apple
based I think because in one of the
episodes uh
I think a few years ago you can go check
through the Odyssey boy Blogspot I wrote
about this the the new gold did it comes
in so you tell them to do some type of
thing that I've never heard of on a
computer it's because it's like you have
to take some type of thing that happens
on Max and one of the kids they
airdropped sent the photos from a tablet
to one of the new kids who just was on
the field trip with them to the tablet
so that's that's very
tablet airdrop based technology which I
have an app to be able to send and
receive airdrops on my phone
um Android phone of course I haven't
tested it yet it doesn't need Wi-Fi
permissions so I need to get an iPhone
here on Wi-Fi so
I need to find someone with an iPhone on
Wi-Fi but we need to talk about this
episode here I guess my girl howling and
then lastly we'll finish off of this is
love battle which is utterly insane and
I will scream about it so
episode 537 Adventures in Odyssey
no we want episodes about something
actually happened
uh but laptops are seen as cooled and
new right and this kid basically gets a
desktop computer it has something of a
head step on it and he can communicate
with it's kind of like Alexa
um
but at the end of the episode
he breaks his headband input device and
he unplugs the computer
but
the thing is because I guess he was
letting the computer control them
um the thing is this that oh you can't
even see it okay okay the thing is
it makes no sense the the computer this
is 2004 year old it's an advanced AI I
guess you can talk to it has a headband
mind control whenever this came out then
overcome it was just kind of weird
um
the computer's saying please Don't
Unplug Me Please Don't Unplug Me yo we
will delete all our previous information
and conversations what that makes no
sense
what kind of computers like if if you
unplug me and I die then you don't have
any more um
data on me but is this computer just
running off of ram did they just take
the storage out like how how did this
work that makes no sense
how is a computer that's super
controlling can become emotion it learns
with you as you grow
they merge together it can do his
homework with them it creates lives it's
basically like chat gbt and Alexa
combined but yet
the the cyberdyne superplex deluxe
9000.58
enhanced learning cannot
they haven't figured out the concept of
storage yet
that that's insane I'm sorry that that
is crazy but this this episode from Kids
Corner which I mean there are many
critical episodes we can talk about how
somehow in the Kids Corner Universe
there's an application that lets you
just track your friends by typing in
their phone number
if only an application like that existed
in real life they don't those apps in
the Play stores are scams
um
but this this is still
all right on the Odyssey boy at
blogspot.com no we haven't forgotten
about the website
lizard love battle
you know one of my other famous things
in the teenage whatever
it just takes the OMG and OMG cable to a
new level it is this kind of references
Tech because you know it references this
radio station
and as you can see here I scratched out
with a friendship I say intelligence
and this is love battle half the
characters it's just dumb
that Liz Spike and morning all see and
attractiveness at the at the pool and
then you guys throw to the the pathetic
questions you see in every movie of all
time Across the Universe
um where one kid's like it's
stumbling over his words you know
basically whatever it's just common
truth okay and she calls this listen and
then they start like kind of like play
fighting a little schools whatever
um first off first mistake here why did
Spike say that he had a radio show well
because he wanted to impress you and Liz
agreed to give him that makes no sense
but the absolute dumb part that comes
into this episode
Liz inspect we didn't even go but Liz is
nice he goes to mess around the video
why why who knows maybe she's being nice
finger food
doing yourself like the literal literal
first minute of the show and I will pull
up the episode right now
and you are going to hear this
during the first minute of the show I
mean honestly the first 30 seconds Molly
calls in to the show to tell them that
he is with uh what's the girl's name uh
let me check the website here what's
your name Casey Casey yeah she calls in
oh my gosh
look at the AI here hopefully you can
see this on screen oh you can't yeah I
just typed in lizard love battle and it
says listen love battle is an episode of
the podcast Kids Corner it's not a [ __ ]
podcast whatever Liz and friends in this
episode a new girl arrives at school Liz
Spike and more I want to take you to the
dance the episode was released October
12 2012 it is 22 minutes and 42 seconds
long and it's probably getting back from
some podcasts website that is
that is really good um according to this
uh episode here kids condos left battle
is a popular children's game where
players controllers which engage in
battles with other lizards and a fun and
interactive virtual world that that is
that is that is um not true um anyway
listen love battle just fun fact great
Google AI right there
um back to the article here of the
height of stupidity and this is where
the episode makes learnerships like the
only reason there's an episode is
because of this if you didn't call in
you've been able to ask her and he
wouldn't have been able to lose to Rusty
with okay uh if he did not call in he
would not have had his chance wait he
would have had his chance okay to talk
and enjoy each other's company alone
what do you think they were going to be
this gonna stand there and play the
radio station that they only played so
that she would like them
um
when no one's listening like they may be
stupid they're not that though and he
listen to the scene because it is
honestly
I don't know what more he was thinking
kids are over here thought it'd be a
good idea to relax and get some ice
cream you know your school dance is
coming up
[Music]

doing his radio station to increase his
chances he's not even listening to the
