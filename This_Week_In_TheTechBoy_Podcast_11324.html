<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 11324</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast
of
course yep all right here we go yeah
sorry we're having technical
difficulties internet here is atrocious
uh yes the Texans did win I was right
and uh yeah have fun watching on what's
it called Paramount Plus Peacock yeah
peacock unless you live nearby um yeah
so hello everybody and welcome back to
the this weekend the techway podcast um
we have plenty to talk about today um
the techboy released two articles this
week and we will be releasing two new
brand new YouTube shorts me going
Hands-On at Cusco with an iPhone 15 with
an iPhone 15 Pro and also me going
Hands-On with the uh with
my what's it called
website uh the robot driving thing all
right yeah so um plenty to talk about
today and also lot to react um
too
CES happened this week and uh there's
just weird thing weird weird things
happened uh on CES so weird devices got
launched at CES there's this thing
called the rabbit R1 I think rabbit R1
which is this this um uh it gets put
great I mean this is amazing this is how
it gets
put uh one comment to placed it and as
um
go let me just pull up the
website ah yes a $9,000 toilet but we
not here to talk about that we're here
to talk about the
um the rabbit R1 because it looks really
interesting it's kind of like a Humane
AI pin but you know
cheaper so let me pull up this website
NTB here you
go let me see how it looks on screen
okay here we go um yeah so here we go
here's some stuff here from Roland Chung
from from X which this has a bad word in
it so we're not going to play the video
but here he is a $88,500 smart toilet oh
wait I think I might be able to mute the
audio Yeah if I mute the audio then
we'll be able to play there you
go this is a toilet that is $88,500 CES
2024 you put your foot there and it
opens I
mean that's nice but for $88,500 I mean
this toilet to use the restroom for me
all right here we go here's another one
now this is from The Verge so we're
going to you know cancel them you're
cancelled um
um oh this tot also comes with remote
control I mean that's nice but who has
8,500 like they say in this article
here oh wait it works with Alexa hey
Alexa open up my toilet it's weird and
you can also purchase it on Prime so you
can have Amazon order your toilet for
you and then you can have Amazon open
your toilet for
you that's it's
nice I mean if they send it to me I will
review that toilet I just don't know how
we're going to get it in it's not like
we're going to remove the toilet we
already have to replace it with a new
smart toilet okay here we got a foldable
screen what is
this uh okay let me see what this is I
can turn audio back
on
that doesn't look that impressive it
this looks like the projector that they
have it's just like a ball projector and
then just some random screen Ian that
could be made for like
$30 a keyboard oh it's clicks for iPhone
now I want to know that since the new
iPhone now has USBC right if the clicks
for iPhone 15 Pro Max case 16.7 in would
fit on my Samsung s22 Plus 6.6 in right
that's what I'm wondering like would
would it would it work because it has
USBC I think the iPhone is slightly
bigger so it would
fit and
then the iPhone is
also I don't know if the bezels those
bezels areu so yeah I'm not going to pay
at $139
$159
to um test that out if clicks would be
willing to send it to me or if some
other YouTuber
would
uh if some other YouTuber would help me
uh
out by posting a video about it I would
gladly react to them um so yeah
then there's the uh transparent screen
from Samsung which as boss says yeah it
looks cool but like shomi launched one
but then transparent then you got to
like clean it for dust you got to like
the back liing lighting technology isn't
that good because it's you know
transparent and it's not that the color
reproduction and everything because you
can you know still see through it so
let's see what this looks
like Samsung did pretty good uh well
with this technology here this seems
like wouldn't put this in your home
because you can still see the stuff back
there maybe like as an art display
or I don't know also you know that this
is specifically curated to Showcase how
well the TV
works but let's say you're watching say
like a sport Max m match on here so like
say oh hello Robert um let's say you're
watching like a sport match on here like
you know a dumping of the Browns against
the Texans and you know how fast the
that's a TV you know how fast the Texans
are moving around getting all those
pixes and stuff I'm not sure that this
TV would uh work well with that oh yeah
I almost forgot to mention that we got
this RTL SDR let me full screen here RTL
SDR here and we will be talking about
this because I was able to intercept
some walkie-talkie traffic until my
software didn't really work and then my
free trial expired on the SDR app for
Android but when I was able get this
working I was able to intercept my own
walkie-talkie traffic so this be really
good let's say signals intelligence
let's say it's only 40 something vals uh
comes with the antenna and the component
itself and I think about it for
$40 right you set up your say spy agency
here you can intercept all the other
agents uh Communications over over
walkie-talkie over walkie talk so that
smart here speaking of spy agencies we
got to talk about the new fality episode
Cu uh it's all my dreams rolled up into
one that's if for living in Baltimore I
wouldn't want to live to but uh all my
dreams rolled up into one like literally
every single one all we'll get into that
later um all right here here we go and
then we got a card that deploys a
personal helicopter this looks like it's
in I don't know Swedish let's see here
oh look at this van here this looks like
you took that what's it called cyber
truck here and then just expanded
six-wheel drive it's probably electric
but
[Music]
whatever
Unfortunately they didn't get a real
demo because this looks maybe CGI or
they tested out like Sweden or something
it wasn't x yet
[Music]
C I mean that's basically just get a
pickup truck and put a helicopter in the
back of it that's not
really how supposed to get back
[Music]
in
I can see this being used for a spy
movie think about it the like thing
deploys and have to save the people from
the Swiss Alps or something like that
okay
toothbrush oh yes here it is the rabbit
AI from Wild which uh we probably also
hate because uh If U did helicopters I
mean itd probably cost like $650 a
minute or per 10 minutes that would be
expensive also what if you run out of
power like if you run out of gas in a
car or run electricity in a car you're
fine you you're only going 60 M hour but
if you're running out of electricity or
gas in a helicopter over the Swiss Alps
I mean you're screwed you're going to
crash and
burn probably burn if you have an
electrical because you're basically
riding on a giant cell phone battery and
um you wouldn't want that to happen we
go this is the R1 a new pocket friendly
AI companion from a startup called right
we got the USBC Port here and it's made
by teenage engineering so uh
yeah rabbit has a touchcreen a score
wheel and a push talk button a
touchcreen and a score wheel what is
this 2008 it's like a Blackberry I mean
think about this we got touch screens
and scroll Wheels coming back with this
rabbit R1 like PDA 2008 and then we got
um keyboards coming back with clicks for
iPhone it's 2024 the new 2008 we got you
know pdas we got uh
Backup backup
um
we got keyboard cases you hear about
that flight that took off from London
half to JFK of cook o I think it was Oh
you mean the flight where the people got
sucked out of the plane oh yeah I heard
about that speaking of a phone a
specific phone I think it was like an
iPhone 15 Pro so shout out to iPhone I
guess survived the 16,000 foot fall off
the plane oh no the iPhone case is not
silly that iPhone Cas is not silly if it
was for Android I would totally I want
that I mean I'd have a full full screen
here so you know if I was you know like
the average teenage I'd think oh yeah
full screen I can like comment on my Tik
Tok post uh without having to swipe up
or anything but since you know we got
profitable and our famous for hitting
Tik Tok uh I mean I could send emails
from this thing better presentations I
wonder how my phone react I wonder if it
would think it's in Dex mode which
didn't try to explore to an exim monitor
um that keyboard I'd really like it I'd
really use it and it's also removable oh
wait you're not about that okay uh
here's the wired video which is how you
interact with it like a walkie-talkie
there's also a camera that can rotate
360° 360 degree camera do you know what
this reminds me of what's it
called it's theind like the VTEC inot
tab that I
had the VTEC inot tab that we had here
like five years ago age for children 4
to9 which is like more bezel and screen
with a 360 C let me look at
this oh wow look at this
Hightech inot technology right
there including up and down activ I like
that VTEC Ino phone I think I mean at
least on day I watches they have a
proper dual camera
setup like they couldn't even afford two
cameras to put on but but the says mean
that you can take pictures of the
ceiling each you drop videos for the
tablet hey if someone wants to send me
an Ino tablet I will review it okay how
much is an Ino tablet anyway I used to
have a kitty zoom watch till the screen
came off i' still use it I mean it's the
Best Buy watch if you think about it it
has dual well the one I had had one cam
but the new one has dual cameras you can
send files to your Fringe remotely if
they have two of the same kinds of
watches I mean that is high technology
right there you just have to scan a QR
code with your watch and it doesn't even
connect to the internet and I think you
can also sync it to the cloud if
connected to computer or your phone via
Bluetooth or something I mean that's
perfect watch Samsung Apple watches have
nothing on it don't have cameras on
there and like there's rayb band things
have the little light on it for privacy
reasons but this K kitty zoom watch I
mean because they don't expect people to
use it for like SN because it's like a
one megapixel camera I mean it's the
best uh spywatch of all time if you
think about it touchcreen low cost I
mean if someone wants to send us a kitty
zoom watch would wouldn't happy take it
here here it is here the VTEC
phone the Kitty Buzz 3 oh oh wait did
the Kitty Buzz 3 upgrade Kitty bu 3
looks in the kitty bu
2 what
this oh my gosh I mean look at this
thing this thing looks like
that HD version of a smartphone from
1996 sans's keyboard in a bzel here I'm
pretty sure the screen the body ratio is
more like 51 to 50 or something like
that here's the Kitty Buzz
I mean this thing looks like a
smartphone from
say ancient
use this looks like a Samsung
S3 like the aesthetic of a 2005 phone
and it's the smartphone for kids yeah so
uh back to the Rabid R1 as a deao
privacy shutter it doesn't need to be
paired with any other device as there's
a Sim slot for cellular connectivity oh
yeah sure be like hey uh my
[Music]
you so someone just going to be like hey
hey
uh hey rabbit uh
call I don't know come off the name hey
hey hey rabbit call Bob you have to just
keep saying that all throughout the
place I mean I have voice Types on my
bus people kept looking at me weird I
don't think running around um push to
talking like it's a walkie-talkie people
to call out of people is g to work it's
not going to replace your phone at least
for now since it's not designed for
games or
entertainment I've never gamed on my
phone unless you count chess but it
wants to handle the menial tasks you do
every day from hailing in Uber making
dinner reservations or even booking
travel just press I have never held an
Uber book dinner or held traff from my
phone and why would I want to buy a $200
accessory to open the Uber
app and it's huge I mean this is like
one two three three Apple watches three
or four Apple watches with like a screen
to body ratio of I don't know
6040 press the button and ask the R1 to
handle a task and it'll execute it
there's a unique technological approach
in making all of this work but it's a
mix of open AI chat GPT large language
models to ident oh speaking of chat GPT
they started putting chat GPT in Vol
wagons I kid you
not
I mean imagine the kids like oh no it's
the day before a big test I don't know
what I'm GNA do I have a 10,00 page
essay to write and they're like hey
Volkswagen write me a 10,00 page essay
about um
Samsung but speaking of Samsung they are
having uh their AI phone here and it's
not looking good for the s23 forra
they're talking about AI Zoom so
uh you know that's it's not good because
that would mean they might take away
that 10 time zoom cam so that AI better
be really good and they better work
offline there we go Volkswagen is
bringing chat gbt into its cars over in
Europe I don't know why they can't bring
it to the
US uh whatever so uh Robert maybe you'll
get this over in the uh well you're not
in the EU anymore but over in UK let's
see I don't's it called that's the uh
Humane AI pin and they laid out 4% of
their staff but the device cost $99 plus
24 24 USD a month to
run so it costs the price of like an
upper mid-range like flagship phone so
s23 Fe right OnePlus
11 maybe even like a uh yeah we talked
about it on our podcast like it costs
the price of a regular smartphone $700
maybe even say a folding phone off of
eBay and then you have to pay $24 a
month to run it
and it doesn't go a proper screen so
you're paying pretty much a cell phone
plan for a fake cell phone attachment
device that would be essentially paying
$700 for an Apple Watch Ultra and then
paying
say of on top of another cell phone it's
like you bought another cell phone and
added a new line to it and you have to
have it for it because it's Power by
chat CH like if I were to buy $700 smart
you can do plenty with it with offline
you can take pictures you can record
videos
you can watch videos if you download
them you can listen to music you can
send files of a Bluetooth you can uh you
can edit video um all kinds of things
right you can even use the new app that
we talked about Lela AI offline if you
just you can connect to Wi-Fi and do a
whole bunch of stuff right you can even
watch videos stream videos you do
everything with this you can't do a
single thing and you must pay for a
subscription to that is crazy but here
we go Volkswagen AI here is getting to
the chat GPT game which AUST 23 seemed
like hey we have a new idea for our
project we have a new we have a new um
thing that we need to do right what are
we going to do next with the devices oh
let add AI now some some of the
things some of the things many is the
new VW Golf some of the things um were
important like say noce they integrated
Ai and I think it's good I don't know
but I mean some people just integrating
AI into refrigerators TVs anything
that's electric probably like your light
bulb uh plugs now ai into the
refigerator was actually pretty smart
because then they
could make recipes based on what's
inside of it so that's a good use of AI
but I mean come on you have you can't
just be like oh a is a new thing all
right let's just add it to our like
toilet it's probably G be on that smart
toilet verion 3 if it's not there yet
but here we go Vol swagen in the chat
TPT game to read researched content out
loud today
um so apparently the cars Voice
Assistant you know like how the voice
text in
cars I think you can still drive the car
you just won't be able to control like
the heating and cooling and stuff but
I've never heard of a Tesla screen
breaking like what did you do to take a
baseball bat to
it so it they integrated chbt onto its
integrated voice assistance so you know
like say voice like turn up the volume
call Mom Etc and then you can use it to
control infotainment um ask Steph about
the car
handsfree and it can also yeah so this
will answer question about the car and
you can also ask questions about it but
it's censored so you can't ask it
questions say about
like oh so the other AI That's on top of
it for like more limited and stuff it's
not going to tell you 10 reasons to buy
a
toota which is kind of weird because I
guess they don't want you buying another
question but so it seems like they have
Ida which is the in car system right so
that can do stuff like turn up the
volume call Mom and
then what's it called s Ser serin which
can answer questions about your car
specifically but if you added question
about someone else's Quest it's going to
Senter that and if it's a more general
question like if you asked who was on
the Super Bowl right then it's G to ask
well I good question GPT I guess because
it's connected to Internet who who
wanted Super Bowl then you'll get that
but then the strategy is also censed
because it's not going to talk about
sensitive topics
like
something uh I don't think chpt has
planned obsolescence and cause and Tesla
seem to be pretty reliable now I'm not
saying that Endor Tesla all gas for now
because you know you can't carry gas but
I don't think it's PL planted
obsolescence in the car I mean there's
no objective proof of that and as some
of you guys know I hate despise
conspiracy theories so yeah all right
back to our rabbit R1 defy your intent
and large action models to execute oh
look show you stocks do you know what
else could St you stocks the iPhone 4
from 2011 trained on several popular
apps right now and its capabilities are
expected to grow over time the camera
isn't meant for selfies it's called the
rabbit eye and you can use it to teach
the R1 new tricks point the camera at
your laptop screen to have it record and
learn a specific task you do the R1 will
then learn it and you can ask it to
perform the same task on your behalf the
company that is pretty smart it's kind
of like uh Bixby routine like in Bixby
routines so these things called tet
macros where you can touch out of
response uh things so open like an app
and maybe you can dial a specific number
or pull up a specific contact for
something that you do you just touch it
and it will do it for you and then you
push the button again and then it does
it for you in that same action I should
probably do a video article about it and
it's it's it's decent right so but this
this is actually pretty smart in my
opinion I mean that's a good
idea all right good
morning and good night to
you he said a trained to the R1 to
survive in the video game Diablo 4 and
theoretically you can have it manage
your character to get to a specific
level you don't have to grind the game
interesting how like does it sync to
your phone is the for a phone game or a
laptop game I'm not sure fortunately we
didn't get to see any live demos but
it'll o no live demos that means it's
curated launching fairly soon you can
pre-order it now for $199 and it's
expected to ship in late
March all right so um yeah that's good
oh looks like having connection problems
that's not
good so yeah
that's that's interesting right there a
new tech
article
and I just got one of those YouTube we
don't like ad blockers screen and
instead of freaking out like a crazy
person I
um I turned off my ad block because I I
don't care about YouTube ads people
acting like YouTube ads with the wor
things since
like like they got tortured like no
one's foring to watch YouTube if you
want to watch video somewhere else go
watch Daily
Motion here you go see s 2024 this is B
your AI companion cuz ai
ai that probably should have been a word
of 2023 not RZ R shouldn't have been the
word of 2023 should have been
AI a verb of
2023 oh speaking
of apparently there's this new feature
in the software that we use where I can
be
uh what's it
called a what is
this I can be vertical
apparently I want to see what it looks
like picture and
picture
and whatever okay I'm just gonna share
my screen the see
yes oh that's it's
interesting
I'm just going to go back to normal here
stop screen
present there you
go oh is Samsung Galaxy M8 versus M7
that's what
nice product
[Music]
placement we got the s23 ultra hey this
could be an s24 ultra I don't know let
me see here what is that is this an s24
ultra early
[Music]
Glimpse that is a interesting layout
there looks like SMS can you talk back
to
[Music]
it you can
[Music]
great that if this is true is pretty
high definition for a projective slash
robot is this a
drone oh okay it's h turn on
lights
hi hi coer hi
B wait that is if it's true it's
gooder hi B this looks like they do off
an iPad I mean if I were Apple I'd Sue
well I mean Apple sues all the time so
that's what I'm saying like that looks
too close to an iPhone for
conflict hey byly follow me to the study
I got to make a video
call hi
Petro that is
clear though I mean this is that
is that is just great integration I mean
no one has that level of technology in
their
house are the chief spr right now they
play
nothing oh they play it seven
okay
it translates with captions right there
that is
[Music]
amazing hey B let's work out today is
upper body day great start if you have
that why do you need a Samsung TV I mean
that is great projection capability
now what is the assisted Samsung Galaxy
def frame Samsung account re to access
Samsung S 88 eight n n 10 10 what are
those what kind of situps are
those connect hey Amy can I call you
back soon
sure oh my gosh this is great
integration but I mean if you have a
smartwatch you could just do hi but
whatever look here you got Bigby text
call which finally works on outgoing
calls that is so good cuz just automate
the car here is today's exercise result
could you call Will okay hey bully we're
going to bed
[Music]
now bring home your new
companion wow
B is this for sale that is amazing
technology if it
works and this is why Samsung's better
than iPhone I mean Samsung beat Apple to
the first car okay and uh whatever Apple
brings to the table like whatever car
they bring Samsung's car would crush it
it would run it over it would shoot it
because Samsung's first car was a
tank I hear is from Samsung Newsroom
five days ago this CES looks amazing I
be next year when I'm old enough to go
to CES should I go let's take a poll
right now should I go to CES if I'm old
enough or when I'm old
enough all right that is amazing I now
we got to talk about this new advention
Odyssey episode because it is it is oh
my goodness it it has everything in it
so here's a synopsis and it's uh from
the club so if you don't have the club
and you don't want to get spoiled for
whatever uh maybe you said mute I don't
know
um Sam
so Buck has moved to
Baltimore and he
um he is approached by Jason Whitaker
who needs him to work on an NSA
assignment right and he's supposed to
get access to this criminal's house to
take his DNA and then take it out pass
it on to Jason and all Ms DNA and then
arrest him right getting War for his
arrest right and the way he has to do
this is he has to get paired up in a
project group someone and they get paed
up and they work on a project at each of
those
houses I mean event NY might as well
just said and then they uh start a
successful Tech blog right uh have
millions of subscribers they could have
written a better episode for me I mean
imagine
that's literally my dream think about
it here it is
here Buck gets to work on a group
project and go to someone's house and
spy on a kid for the NSA I
mean the what oh you can't even see it
what more would you
want what what more could you
want I mean that's
amazing that
it's my dream in one
episode right there I mean think about
how many 16y olds can go around fing
Compass like yeah I spied for the NSA I
broke into some to and that was only
part one that was only part one I got to
go over to have a c project with someone
I made a new friend like and then what
he wins the Super Bowl uh well not Super
Bowl the the championship of his
football league that is
literally everything that anyone could
ask for in a game not a
game episode on
nice that's
amazing all right all right let's see we
have more CES stuff to get to John Ringo
posted a video and speaking of YouTube
posting apparently what name mat p is
retiring so uh that's kind of sad if you
like these
[Music]
videos how can a 140 in TV suck like how
is that possible but whatever year for
the last few decades the tech world has
descended on Las Vegas to get a
firsthand look at the latest and
greatest dang CES and the Super Bowl in
the same city back to back amazing
amazing products looking to be the next
big thing for the upcoming year hundreds
of thousands of products have risen on
the show floor and also Fallen
completely flat wait they released the
xrox at
CES all right let me tell you some
stories from somebody who's been on the
show floor for 13 years and also show
you some of the coolest stuff they've
got here now and also revisit as some of
the stuff years past actually ended up
doing it's always TVs like I mean this
has got to be the biggest place to see
TVs TVs and CS have been best friends
for a really long time uh this is where
we saw some of the newest Technologies
are now commonplace first time we saw
OLED mini LED CU all the technology we
the bestel on that thing K TV saw a
debut here at CES and sort of keeping
with
that so
look it is a translucent box essentially
that is a TV and if you look at it look
it looks like they just like cut it
removed it from the background it's kind
of like strange right like we can see
through it there's a film that can come
up to make it look like a regular TV but
when it's down it kind of gives like a
holographic 3d effect which is
technology we've seen a ton of at CES in
years past I can't tell you how many
years companies tried to make 3D
technology a thing uh I'm not sure if
trans technolog been 100 years I mean
we've had 3D displays for 100 views just
gonna go that same way but it certainly
is incredible to see and like speaking
of TVs one company that's kind of
synonymous with TVs is Roku so they
didn't debut here but they did debut of
their Streaming Stick uh here at CES
2012 and obviously you know that did
pretty well for them they also showed
the first iteration of Roku TV here at
CF I kind of got an early look honestly
kind of blew off what Roku was doing for
a very long time and then they started
to get really good really efficient s we
have I we like it I think we like the
fire stick better everywhere so listen I
was wrong about Ru I apologize probably
a few things in this list I'm be wrong
about two in about 10 years uh but it's
really cool to see the evolution of a
company like Roku although I will say
after all those years roku's UI still
looks almost identical so while Roku was
a success it's not a compliment I guess
it looks garbage some things don't
always work out uh Razer has been really
ambiti showing off looks like a spy base
right there you got your communication
right here your hacking right here and
you're like tracking right there past
they showed off one called project
Valerie it kind of solves the problem of
what if I want to work work on a laptop
or game on a laptop but I also want an
ultrawide monitor what they did was it
was a laptop with three separate screens
I saw it I tried it it worked really
well but then it was gone from existence
I doubt we'll ever see it but another
kind of cool use of CES the place kind
of showcase some technology and if it's
really never Des they do have triple
monitor setups that you could buy and
clip onto your
laptop oh what Dang the Chiefs already
SC a touchdown this game have the best
of CES list without talking about smart
lights they came on to the scene fast
and they have stayed strong and sort of
the ruler of a whole smart light space
actually this video sponsored goie whose
lights we have in the studio whose
lights I have in my house and whose
lights I am itching to put in my
backyard and they are bringing it this
year like they tend to do every year
first all their booth looks pretty epic
uh so this year it's all about AI
there's also a ton of devices now that
support matter so walking through the
whole Go Booth first of all you can
customize pretty much everything outdoor
light with AI was really cool so they
have some steps as you walk up the steps
pretty nice uh how are they integrating
AI though the lights changed thought
that was really awesome also they're
using AI with an assistant so you can
sort of set the mood instead of having
to go in and say I want the blue H up
okay okay and red Hues down you're gonna
say I'm watching a Laker game I'm
watching sports or I'm watching an
action movie and automatically set
things for you do the light s to your TV
that be nice uh we still have in our
studio the TV lights that got updated
this year as well some cool scenes for
action shots or if you're watching a a
movie last year we got a chance to check
out what [ __ ] was doing for gaming like a
nice streaming setup this year they are
using Ai and adding HDMI 2.1 support So
support games with up to 8K resolution
that is a big update to awesome setup
GOI is the best name in lights they
bring power they bring efficiency they
bring AI in functionality most
importantly they bring all of that at a
really affordable
price T picking up C which we sold our
TCL phone out there so uh regrets
portion this show for pretty much every
year is like tech for your house how can
tech make your life easier in a lot of
ways make it like way more complicated
the years past used to be like cameras
and smart locks and that kind of thing
but like everything this year it's like
ai ai ai and then also Tech that can
like feed your dogs so there's a lot of
what is this is this a lawn mow for
offload AI optimize things to go about
your house we got things you'd expect we
got robot vacuums robot mops um robot
bird feeders we got AI built into
toaster pans appliances kind of AI an AI
pan
smart AI cooking plan you can control it
with an
app control what a pan is a piece of
metal that you put on your stove to cook
it's not like you can an electric pan
then that make
sense track details like weight time
temperature and nutritional content oh
okay okay okay so it's more of a
nutrition thing not a cooking okay I
built in to absolutely everything now
kind of permeating oh look it's a police
bot
wait CES is in Las Vegas not Barcelona
right all aspects of your house this
category I think has changed the most
over the years it went from like let's
just throw a tech into everything so now
let's throw Ai and Tech into everything
and if there's one area I think there's
a lot of room for growth it's here
probably one of the biggest success
stories here like in the history uh of
CES is ring uh fun fact they were
actually based in the same building as
the original TechnoBuffalo office we got
to know those guys oh wow pretty well um
obviously you know what ring does they
were bought by Amazon but long before
that they had an idea to make a doorbell
smart but like all small business it was
hard to get financing when my favorite
ring memory was a couple years ago that
event where first of all I got to meet
Shaq which as a Laker and wait is that
uh that a couple years ago an event
where first of all I got to me Dino
drive in and Dives Shack which as a
Lakers fan I'm still excited about but I
and when introduced myself to him I said
hi my name is John my screen name is
John for Lakers I love you so much he
looked at me dead in the eyes I mean
down at me was like I know you and I was
probably one of the happiest moments um
of my life it was really how is that
possible how does he know him from like
YouTube experience but ring is
definitely one of the biggest success
stories really in the history of
Cs wow got an entire Netflix screen in
your
car recent years especially after my ex
you want to sit in the front Microsoft
stopped giving the Keynotes here at CS
sort of big product announcement stopped
cars have taken over a big portion of Cs
we have seen over the years some insane
Concepts things that are never going to
hit the road something that surprisingly
did I remember a few years ago being
able to see the Fisker ocean at a very
small booth and clearly thinking that's
never going to hit the road but recently
I think surprising was when Sony rolled
out a car that nobody saw coming and it
appear it's actually going to be a real
thing so it's called a Fila and the're
partnering with Honda I wonder if you
could get like the Sony car to work with
your Sony
phone the car called the f one mark
x5v that actually bring this out to
Market and they brought it out on stage
being powered by a PlayStation
controller that's a terrible name Sony
Honda mobility just fire to naming
people only just replace them with
AI now I doubt that's ever gonna be a
thing that you would ever do uh but
seeing Sony find a partner and get into
the automotive space kind of symbolize
that everybody's kind of moving into
cars but there are still a ton of cars
happening here but before they end up in
the graveyard of Automotive History you
second can say I saw them speaking of
the one I saw in 2015 actually at the
Panasonic Booth of all places the
original model X concept was here they
see a lot of model X on the road now
back 2015 that was nuts to see in person
tell it's a concept that had the old ter
nose cone at the model X initially had
but seeing those Falcon Wing doors for
the first time in person was awesome and
look at the car see a lot of this stuff
never actually needed to production but
there's that screener you're talking
about yeah CS is a place where a lot of
Technology makes it ding the show has
changed over the past 13 years as have I
uh those first few years here were some
of my greatest memories of all in Tech I
mean filming on my own and editing 15 20
videos oh wow look at that uh old
Samsung laptop almost per day this is
the first place that actually I got to
have an experience El Eve CS always has
a special place in my heart to where I
get a chance to not only see friend
technology
somebody when I finally get to go there
and speak uh yeah so let's talk about
this new AI
thing uh let's
see
here it
is it's called stat Muse and it it has a
really good search right here
so let's say I wanted know
like
most
so you asking a question about sports
right and it pulls it up and yeah there
we go today they scored the most points
and um Texans playoff
history and see it's pretty updated
because this game happened
today and then the most that they had
last time would be
31
in the least of it I have a seven
that's and you can ask it
say so it's really good to chat about
stats with say AI so let's say what it
says here
oh I misspelled yard you have to be like
specific and boom right there it pulls
it up pulls up a picture of the player
so I'm going to click there so
the system could be
better like for understanding typos like
CH GPT can but it's not too I mean it's
good
oh it doesn't do c it twitch yeah yeah
so it does answer questions it's really
good there you have it and yeah we're
going to leave it there for now God
bless we're going to talk a whole bunch
of teenage trains and stuff later God
bless text talk to you later pray for Na
and
go</pre>
