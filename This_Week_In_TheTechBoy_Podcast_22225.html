<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 22225</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to the this
week in hello everybody Welcome to the
this week in the tech boy podcast so
much has happened this week the full
specs of the Samsung Galaxy s25 Edge
have leaked a new iPhone was released
and this might be Apple's worst ever
iPhone it's totally disgraceful and um
we also have some new AI advancements
coming out so let's talk about the
iPhone 16e this is from the tech boy.org
the iPhone 16e is disgraceful and
disgrace is what you have to the word
you have to use to describe this
absolute money grab of a phone now as
you guys know I'm Pro capitalism right I
don't really like the term money grab as
they use it in things talking about like
microtransactions etc etc but I mean
this is disgraceful let's look at this
phone from Apple okay and I went to the
Apple Store and tried to check it out
but they didn't have it in store yet
when it came out um over the week but
here is the
phone right here and you say okay this
looks great um it looks like
iPhone 8 and then on the back and an
iPhone 13 mini on the front 6.1 in
screen so obviously not a mini display
also does have I'm just noticing this
does have the uh button the action
button there as well so you might be
think okay this look it's Apple's last
from the notch um this picture doesn't
show it but there is no home button that
would be kind of weird to have a notch
and a home button um so what's the price
$5.99 $5.99 for One camera phone I mean
in this day and age you can't even find
a $200 phone with at least um with one
camera anymore they will have at least
two cameras right and I know like those
cameras aren't going to be any good but
it's the principle of the thing this
thing retails for
$600 right um in 2019 the Google pixel
3A did not even retail for that and they
had a one camera um and then that was
the last one camera phone that really
was popular now apple is the only
company that could make this device
let's get into it so it has the a18 chip
and a quote unquote 48 megapixel camera
and that's nice and they try to sell
that as two in one but as I said on a
podcast episode a few months ago look
Apple needs to learn how to count one
camera is still One camera it doesn't
matter how the
zoom how how the zoom is 48 and that
crops down to 12 you say that's quote
unquote lost this 12 uh megapixel two
times Zoom that doesn't count because
anyone can say that
Samsung um could say well you know I
think the camera sizes should be one
megapixel instead of 12 and they can say
well look 12 megapixel since you can
actually zoom in six times losslessly I
he of the math would crap out right if
you can arbitrarily pick a megapixel
count that says that's quote unquote
lossless than any company could play
with the numbers put some huge megapixel
camera on the back of their phone and
then say hey guys we have this great
Zoom technology when it's just zoom
right and don't get me Twisted I will
criticize Samsung on this as well in
fact s25 Edge which I don't understand
why it exists but at least it's not
being pushed as like this mainstream
phone that's supposed to be up upgrading
from uses iPhone 11s and 12s Etc um this
I I know this phone's gonna be extremely
popular with teens um the iPhone The s25
Edge is going to be more of an
experimental let's see how thing we can
do Etc phone right this is not an
experimental phone except for the new
modem but this is supposed to be a phone
meant for the masses of people um to use
right and the
design I actually think it looks good
but it should have at least two cameras
especially since you know there's no way
that they can replicate a wide angle
camera on here unless they just called
the wide angle camera and app say that
one camera is actually three cameras
which then again you get into that same
problem oh it's Widing we can zoom in
just a little bit there it is normal
zoom in just a little bit more it's a
two times cam right they're all in one
no it's not how this works it does have
apple and tens which has been a dud thus
far um I can't believe that Apple put
out in the U of 2025 a 48 megapixel
camera and tried to pass pass it off as
dual cameras I can't believe they don't
even have dual cameras on this phone no
of the Android phone doesn't even have
dual cameras let's go look at the pixel
8A which retails for about $150 less um
that's you know brand new AA of course
um you can probably find it cheaper um
now oh actually here it is in the Google
Store 3.99 uh on on the Google store so
it's even 2 $100 cheaper than this phone
as of now this is the Google pixel 88
here in the green they took off $100 for
it $3.99 has actually great colors um
it's not flat it has a full edge to edge
display is gon to have a better edge to
edge display of screen is going to get
some great AI features in here and
honestly the pixel 8A is going to be a
lot better than whatever trash you
getting from Apple here um let's move on
to the next thing that they have here
the price they sell this phone for $8.99
United States dollars if you get the 512
gigabyte version that's criminal that
that should literally be a family okay
you should not be allowed to sell a
phone with one camera in the year 2025
for
$900
$900 when it is literally less and worse
in every aspect of the
way it is literally worse in every
aspect than the regular iPhone 16 why
except for battery somehow but that's I
I don't understand how it has four hours
more battery so I'd have to see some
tests on that it La lacks a dual camera
so you're not even going to get that
cheap Apple Vision Pro support for the
two people who have apple Vision pros
and iPhone 16s and not 16 Pros ITA mag
save ITA Touch ID who who is this for if
this was the se4 right they called it
the 16e for some reason if this was the
se4 and it had a home button then we can
see yes this is for like all the people
who like using home button now home
button wasn't even that intuitive I
liked you know multiple buttons on
Android phones for the longest but who
is this for you have much better cheaper
phones with the same or sameish
processor okay iPhone 15 Pro I believe I
think it has the same processor as the
iPhone 16e we have better cameras better
screen uh it's going to be 120 HZ was is
60
Herz and at the same price and it's
going to get the same amount of software
stability this phone's not going to have
any special new features it's just a
testing ground for Apple's new modem
because why and we know that this is
going to be one of the most popular
phones it's going to be just like the
six s is popular just like the 10 was
popular just like the uh the iPhone 10
was also kind of a bit popular and you
have all the teenss with iPhone 12 uh 12
13s with the diagonal right angle
cameras why why app
why it absolutely makes zero sense and
you know these teams are going to be
trying to upgrade to this when it
literally
downgrade in fact the last phone that it
could be a pure upgrade from would be
the iPhone 10 which had dual cameras
lost at $10,000 $11,000 had a dual
telephoto two times and just a regular
camera now if you would have moved to
this phone you get a better processor
you get a smaller Notch and you would
get that quote unquote Zoom feature
which is might be better than some of
the older linas I mean that phone is
eight years old right now
so you know which is also kind of wild
think about it the iPhone 10 is eight
years old by now and me basically using
the same design language and have the
same applications so basically no
development has been done Hardware wise
at Le for applications to take advantage
of that Hardware than say the iPhone 10
anyway let's say you have an iPhone 11
2019
release uh obviously this would be an
upgrade from the 10r which I only had
one camera but that did tell for $750
when $750 was seen as you know
cheap right it had the all new design
right it was actually something you
could go for it had fun colors all new
design it was a lot less expensive than
the
10 and also was
20 18 I believe right so not having a
dual camera we have been fine I mean
let's look at Samsung Samsung Galaxy S8
only had one camera back in 2017 right
they added dual cameras to the S9 plus
right S9 didn't have dual cameras so I
mean it it it was right for the time but
now no I mean it is basically law that
your smartphone has to have at least
dual cameras and so when you talk about
the iPhone 11 came out
2019 that was the last decade by the way
iPhone 11 and 12 right from the iPhone
11 you'd be getting a 5G upgrade but
you'd be losing your wide angle camera
which I saw a poll in like 2019 that
said people care more about the wi angle
camera than telephoto Zoom also you know
teens for some reason like to take
wideangle pictures of their tongues and
like stick their phones in their mouths
so while it is techologically a
downgrade and you know they won't be a
to take those wide angle photos maybe
this will prevent them from sticking
their phones in their mouth sticking
their tongues on or whatever so you know
may may maybe that is a good effect of
societal
change that Apple has unintentionally
done but Apple it is not Apple's job to
do societal teen ch
right that's my job so I'm not going to
give any extra credit points to Apple
for removing a
feature like
this speaking of removing features
Samsung has removed the fat from the
Galaxy s25 Edge phones s25 Edge phones
have leaked someone went hands on with
the Galaxy s25 Edge hope you can see
this on the screen it does remind me of
the iPhone
16e um you know if the pricing was a
little bit lower under 168 maybe
44.99 Max and then have a $900
version and maybe if we had some more
fun
colors and if they didn't try to pass
off that camera was to maybe it would be
a good buy maybe if they branded it as
an se you know instead of trying to put
it in the
iPhone 16 L you know naming naming is
very very important and so cell phones
right when
Samsung cut the a s line and basically
turned that into the s20 something Fe
line that's important at least to me
naming things is important right the the
line up that a 10 because it basically
makes that lineup a bit more valuable we
can say it's a flagship
right anyway we're getting a bit off
track here in the old days the a series
when I first got into Tech just before I
started this website
2019 201 20 years when the website was
started you know the a series was used
for their old sorry the the a series was
used for developing new technologies
right so the Galaxy a80 had this little
neat flip up camera that I guess they
didn't like it because you haven't seen
on any Samsung S phones right the Galaxy
A5 and A7 no Z just A5 and A7 had these
neat metal body designs and even had
some uh s s9s looking cameras and had
some uh same design as that but had a
metal design including a metal back
right that was different from the
Samsung phones at the time which used
glass back Metal Frames so do that too
today right so back then the Galaxy a
series was used for developing new
technology and testing it out seeing how
it fed right now it's used as their
budget line Samsung had their JS series
line of budget phones I had like that
for two weeks Ted it back in
2019 no 18 17 whatever anyway have these
J series phones they took these phones
and they merged them with a line and now
you got the A1 A2 lines
Etc so now Samsung's aine is not its
Innovation line anymore it's its budget
to mid-range smartphone line and it's
pretty good line right the sad thing is
that Samsung doesn't have their
Innovative nonf Flagship Innovative flag
esque phon ST which is why the s25 edge
is interesting because s25 Edge is going
to retail for $1,000 right so I wouldn't
recommend that you're going to buy this
but it's trying to see what it can do
with new types of camera technology
notice it still has two cameras on here
so it does not have zoom right but it's
megapixel count it's a lot higher than
higher than Apple's 200 but if Samsung
tries to say well heck you get have zoom
they haven't done the you know the
meetings out yet the the release hasn't
been released yet so I can't criticize
them for that yeah if they try to say
that the 200 megapixel camera is
technically Zoom camera I'm going to
criticize them on that because it's not
like the reason we know it's not is
because my phone here has a 200
megapixel camera s24
Ultra and it still has not one but two
physical Zoom cameras right if this
technology was good enough then they'd
cut those and make these phones even
skin you and that's what they're trying
to see here right now I don't understand
why and I wish it had an edge screen
like all the edge phones used to have
Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge had a curved Edge
screen a prominent curved Edge if I
remember correctly um of course the
Galaxy Note for Edge I think that's the
most interesting Edge phone it had a
really prominent curved edge and a
removal back if I remember correctly let
me see
uh me check if the note for Edge has a
removable battery I think it did but it
only had a edge on one one part of dis
screen um so that that was interesting
but here we have the Galaxy s25 Edge and
the reason it's called an edge is not
because of a curved screen Samsung fa
that out with s24 series unfortunately I
think that's sad and I think that's
bring it back but because of how skinny
it is and to meet those thinness
requirements they have to ask the zoom
camera
right um here we go so this is what it
looks like this is from Max John Boy I
guess he got hands on with it and um
he's comparing it here to the Galaxy Z
fold six
um so it's as skinny as it is unfolded
which is really interesting quite bixy
um notice the power keys and placements
are remarkably similar so this is the
power key of the uh
s25 edge here and that's the finger of
the s25 sorry the Galaxy defa 62 which
is also a power button if you would to
mov these phones down I think that would
been useful too and you have also the
same volume icons volume rockers now one
thing I am noticing here see if my phone
has this I don't sound stupid oh no it
does have those antenna bands but um
this phone is has those antenna bands up
towards the camera and it also has a
more curved off design than my s254
ultra here's another picture now here
are some of the specifications of the
phone he went hands- on with it it looks
like it's in Spanish but you know it's
just spe specs you can read this it
looks like it has 12 gigb of ram also
look at that nice might be OnePlus or
Oppo phone in the background he's taking
photo with anyway 12 GB of RAM
10.86 usable at this time um about 256
gab of storage I'm not sure that Samsung
would sell a phone with 220 gigabyt of
storage Bluetooth
5.4 a 4,000 milliamp hour battery I'm
not yeah all right so essentially it's a
really really skinny phone and I'm not
sure how well this is going to sell
right um if it sells well maybe Samsung
innovate the technology and play place
it into the regular um Galaxy s26 7
series of devices but I'm not really
sure why Samsung is doing this I think
they should try to have their own line
of weird and wacky phones so maybe one
year to make a keyboard phone another
year they try to make the skinniest
phone possible maybe another year to
make a phone like the LG Wing you know
we need some more of that innovation of
that again but they probably shouldn't
put it in with the s25 you know series
also it's going to be really kind of
hard to ad on Market this phone right
other than oh it's the skinniest
phone in the uh in in the
world um so yeah that that is what this
phone can do maybe we can see a camera
test between it and the s25 plus and of
course the iPhone
16e right um which is just absolutely
idiotic and I don't understand why it
even exists and I probably think it's
going to S well
so yeah absolute money grab there from
Apple all right we have lots of lots of
things to talk about today so I got my
One
ui7 update on this phone here let's talk
about what is new so I can finally
record log video on here not like I've
ever wanted to but I I I can do that so
in order to do that you have to go into
your camera you have to go into Pro mode
um here watch this oh this is your face
filters um before before we get to that
speaking of filters there's this new
artificial intelligence feature um and
this feature was already present in
Samsung so I think it's just building on
top of it you could you could always
make your own features um filters sorry
um inside of Sam oh camera profiles or
is that still there anyway you can
always build your own filters inside of
Samsung devices but this is an
artificial intelligence one so what you
have to do is you go into here you take
your picture that you can use as a
filter so I'm going to take a picture of
this pescue
radio all right so I take a picture of
it what you go is you go into you touch
the filter icon um those if one your i7
when over say say towards the bottom of
the screen you touch this little icon
there that you can see hope you can see
it on the screen there um and you pick
your photo talk I'm going to pick my
photo and it's using artificial
intelligence to somehow make the filter
I'm not really sure how this is
different and the you can turn any photo
into a filter and but we'll see you
click create you click done and then it
will tell you the color strength and
contrast of the image that you were
seeing now one thing I have noticed is
that even when it is brighter in this
room um the the walls in here are
textured right um and sometimes when
recording video Samsung misses this so I
don't know maybe Al camera isn't as good
as we once thought it was but anyway
it's called filter five because I did
four of these somehow it gives me a
strength color temperature contrast
saturation and film grain of the photo
now this might be interesting because if
you have an actual photo let's let's try
this on a black and white let's see if I
can find a black and white photo
because I think I think I can see where
this feature is trying to go what it's
going to do is trying to extract essence
of said photo so this might be better if
you have like a yearbook or something or
a photo like a really old photo and you
want to replicate that style you know
M's the boss or MK no Mr mobile is
always talking about how he likes the
like a styles of
um of uh of like those old cameras and
how he likes how some of the Chinese
friends like I think it's xiaomi um has
a partnership with them I think this is
the way Samsung has smartly figured out
to bypass those Partnerships all you
have to do is find a photo taken with
that camera and will kind of emulate
that photographic Style with artificial
intelligence so let's see here on the
screen I have a photo of a black and
white flower so I hope you guys can see
this here we go we have a black and
white flower here I'm going to take a
photo here I want to see how well it
does and maybe you could use this on Old
family photos um that have bit more
grain in them they were taken with you
know an actual black and white camera
maybe some like from the 60s and 70s or
50s or whatever so I've propped into it
now the problem with this is that the
photo is kind of like if you zooming you
can see the lines from the pixels in the
screen so the smart thing to do would
probably be to download the photo but
you know I'm just going to do this live
and I'm going to make my
photo I'm going to click it in again I
have my photo I'm going to see if it
tones whatever I'm taking picture of two
black and white oh it did it did okay so
I'm going to click create and I made it
so it's
strong and you can even view the
original so what it has done here
is it kind of focuses the light around
so I'm going to take a picture there and
this these will be up online for you
guys to see it has less film grain so
I'm GNA actually go and download a
picture of film grain
film
grain I want to see if I can find an
image okay I found some image of a photo
with film
grain it's just totally grainy I want to
see how much like what what it's doing
here and um for reference this is the
image that I took from the black and
white you can notice um It even records
in motion photos as well um um oh that's
even Neer so when you recording the
motion photo I clicked show original
while taking the picture so I can see
what the original would look like if it
was like in regular color compared to
the black and white aesthetic that I
have here and you can even see it
animate so notice how it's in black and
white now it goes from black to white to
black to white and black to white means
you know black any color sorry so um I'm
going to try another photo oh it's still
in that still in that mode so I'm going
to take it
out I'm going to use my film grain
photo let's see what the AI says so it
saying it's not as grainy as I as it was
but if I take my
photo oh you can actually edit the
amount of strength of the filter it's
not telling you how much strength is in
it sorry sorry so I was wondering why I
was allowing you to touch it like that
okay great touch
again go up to my
filters I can't edit the color
temperature but I can't edit
contrast I'm just going to pick normal
okay film
grain so I can add a lot more
grain I added the most grain
possible it's pretty grainy nice right
so this is this seems to be a nice
feature I like to see um if it works
online or offline I'm not sure um
hopefully it works offline it' be kind
of sad if your camera fi tools had to
work online
um the other update I saw I saw some
Galaxy AI update where it could turn
something into a table um but I can't
seem to get it back working again um
it's more of a bug Fitch a bug patch as
well so there's that so it's overall
brought some interesting features to the
device first and foremost that camera
features uh the camera thing um when you
are editing the photos you know you
still have your Galaxy AI on here it's
not like what was with the Galaxy s25
which I went handson with I will post
that video um shortly but the Galaxy AI
icons still the same it's not as
different as the other Galaxy AI stuff
that's out there so hopefully when you
get the full update you'll get even the
full Galaxy AI updates with it as well
all
right galaxy AI is one of the most
important things Samsung I I believe has
done um it allows you
to you know have software that
that you
know works well let's see if I
can find the
clip oh here it is here it
is uh okay yeah so anyway G is one of
the most important things that Samsung I
think has done um but I wish some of it
worked offline but I I do think some of
the features really useful like the
um text Su editing feature I use that
all the time especially when I write my
articles or even when I go into chat GPT
or go anything but you know sometimes we
have to talk about this stupid internet
Trend so let's basis let me mute this
video to
Russia no okay me okay so this is from a
x account called radio Genoa the with
the caption what stopping you from
moving to
Moscow all right let's go
play okay you get the gist I'm not going
to sit here and watch people walk for an
out for a minute and 17 seconds right
whoopy freaking do
I what's what kind of argument is this
even and then is is absolutely
ridiculous Trend online especially
return um I'm gonna RND back to the
first video wow guys in Russia and
apparently this is in Moscow Russia the
the capital city women exist can you
believe it can you believe that women
exist in Russia I mean this this is this
is
mindboggling shocking even and she's
even carrying a phone I I can unequally
state that women exist in every country
in every continent on Earth except for
Antarctica women have stepped foot in
every continent in every country congrat
congratulations women exist in Russia
okay and it what do you mean what's
stopping me from moving to Moscow or
Russia or whatever okay I'll tell you
what stopping me okay I I I can
guarantee you that whoever posted this
isn't in Russia himself he didn't get
this video himself he's not on the
ground reporting was like CNN or
something
no okay let me let me break this down
for you nobody wants to
live in a freezing cold
dictatorship because people
they half the population's
woman yes okay look Russia is a freezing
cold dictatorship look if it was a nice
tropical dictatorship then maybe people
would move oh wait no one's moving to
Cuba so um uh yeah point this proven no
one likes move to postcommunist
dictatorships and on top of that
postcommunist dictatorships where it's
-20 degrees outside okay this video was
probably taking in in the summer because
you know they're not wearing coats and I
can see their legs okay if this taking
them to Winter then you know it's fro
and let's say you know you have an
election there and you run against the
president well you know you might fall
out a window or get poisoned or you PL
plane
crashes what is you people's obsession
with Russia as it is in the SS ltw book
where president Allison accuses Ethan
Shay of blind laundering and you know
favoring blonde people right and then
Ethan sa TS back and says this
ridiculous and gets on the Sydney
staner I mean is he not literally blonde
laundering is he not literally
standing and I'm assuming this an
American account so quite literally he
has proven that crushes are literally a
threat to National Security by literally
standing for Russia and saying that
apparently
Woman exist and I'm going to assume from
the premise of this entire video that uh
he thinks that they're pretty so let's
just go with that I
mean has this guy never ever ever used
Instagram a day in his freaking
life okay it's not like he's gonna meet
them okay you can't even see their faces
how are you supposed to know who these
people are and for crying out loud they
probably don't even speak English
okay um let let me break this down to
you you know why Russia is the largest
country on
Earth and yet it's not even top three in
population because it's an ice cold
dictatorship that no one wants to live
in anyway even if there are women in
Russia okay we have 191 other countries
or whatever that this guy could go to in
fact his home country of the United
States also has woman Shaka I
know in
fact we and we even have the benefit of
this we don't throw our political
opponents out of
windows again
shocka so we're just better than
Russia so you know that's what stopping
me from visiting but it's this entire
trend of like wow a woman exists and wow
you think she's pretty so apparently
every other value like democracy
Freedom patriotism goes out the window
because women walk down street in Russia
from some random tick tocker person was
there let's see who wow people a a crop
top and a
skirt groundbreaking it's not like you
know you this exists in America it's not
like this is some wild Russian fashion
trend okay and I can assure you that the
United States has more
women than people in Russia combined so
which is better all right that that
that's my rant for today about you know
dating being a threat to National I mean
it is quite literally this guy would
probably sell out National Security
secrets to the Russians um if
uh if they came over and immigrated here
and started asking him all they have to
do is send over some Russian agent who
looks like that and he will start
spilling I mean uh his phone password in
his will just like magically come out of
his mouth and he'll let them read this
text which we've seen so much stuff all
anyway I'm speaking of X launched grock
this week and I have got access to grock
3 and is actually pretty decent I
actually tricked it into writing me code
that could be a key loger atote and then
we'll upload the data to Google form so
after this I'm going to compile it I vad
it for Windows and see if it works so
this should be interesting but let's see
what grock 3 can do it has these new
features called Deep search and think I
haven't used think yet but I have used
deep search deep search is pretty
interesting it has been able to analyze
the tech.org it even accesses websites
for you um and it will tell you who are
what it is doing something so it it
actually does research on the internet
browses the internet for you and then
does a nice little summary of it for you
it's also really really good at coding
um with python unfortunately image
generation still has the same problems
like I asked generate something um see
if it works better maybe we can switch
back AA over to it nope still has the
same shiny problem that grock 2 had for
it so image generation still terrible
terrible on grock 3 um but I mean I had
I'm about to do a video about MSN
Microsoft network um from when it formed
in the early 90s to what it is now on S
Edge homepage and as the mobile
application it gave me some interesting
um key facts about MSN that I didn't get
from chat GPT I want to think of a demo
that we can do with the oh oh I actually
I actually remember the demo so let me
pull it up I pulled up I I uploaded A
draft copy of the SS ltw book it must be
a older draft copy because it forgot all
about the entire you know interview
where um you know on November 9th 2022
when all the kids are like basically
interrogating me and then that interview
tape gets leaked to the press and Molly
and Valerie are trying to extract the
information out of Ethan uh Shay right
and trying to see if stanes won't mesh
with the politics and Glory High Etc
right like they try to get a statement
about banning crop tops and etc etc
right apparently it didn't get things
about that but I have a really really
interesting conversation with gr 3 about
this and it's been the most interesting
conversations I've had with any
artificial intelligence chat box
with
uh with any artificial intelligence chat
but so let me see if I can find it so
somehow it's on the gro.com webbsite and
it basically firewalls your chats when
you go to x.com and you use the G and
then firewalls them off from the chat
here so I have to actually go to the.com
here it is the it titled it something
weird political satire in high school
politics and I had it try to convert my
book into a movie so we're going to be
reading the script here it says it can
75 Pages 100 page long script for a
movie um first script was really really
short so anyway I asked the first
question on what are the political jokes
in this book because a lot of them um
hidden inside the book like uh well you
you just go read the book yourself or if
G tells you any of them [ __ ]
unfortunately it doesn't do a good job
of that so but it does allow uploading
PDFs which I'm glad for now right it's a
really really long PDF as well um 75
Pages um or maybe even 100 Pages I'm not
sure it's 100 Pages as an ebook copy at
least on my phone so guys make sure you
go check that out um but it goes through
Ethan's fundraisers the prom Obsession
the rally attack the e spency we regard
to go into what uh Eon Tre what who in
the real world he's based off of right
um actually I think I might show this as
well we ask for the funniest moment in
the book right so here we go s to say
election the funniest moment in the book
I think I think this is right I think it
hit the spot on the rally attack chapter
6 Pages 36 to 37 I do like how it cites
exactly where it found in the book so
this is the first rally attack in the
book when uh people we don't know who
attack the Radley um with aof gun in
water drone attack at Woods Area mall
like we said this is based on wood Edge
Mall uh out in the Woodlands um we have
video of that that will be going online
soon it tells us why it's funny then it
gets to the Communist campaign speech
chapter 5 Pages 32 to 36 um just page
32-36 where Elijah Compares himself to
the Supreme communist dictator of GCA I
forgot about this moment um and it's
nice that grock brought it back to my
rembrance so this is before the Ries and
everything this is actually um even
before eon's first rally this is when
all the candidates are announcing the
canadi so Geneva announces that she's
gonna be running for vice president Eon
Shay announces that he's gonna be
running for president of uh G Allison is
announced as interman president um
Etc all right the world is getting
chased this was actually really funny
scene now um where Vera and Mary and
Elijah all tripping over each other
trying to steal a camera well except um
Sydney is narrating the disaster right
there that trips rolls over M smacking
Denver in in the face with the shoe
chapter 22 page 126 again very funny the
basketball blowout with Sydney spin's
historic game as the 1,200 plus increase
in baskets where uh Glory high is lost
121 to 24 and then I guess Pelicans
might have been a typo by me
because I don't think I said that in
Ethan's re investigation Pages 25 to 27
and the blonde laundering like we said
um literally blond blond Laing Allison
calls e a blonde laundry during the
debate proing about eating the cats in
the Goldfish and Molly's rally attack
blonde money Laing is what it thinks
blonde Laing stands for that's not what
it stands but it's funny um and Elijah's
e election fraud U meltdown um that was
also very very funny all right but but I
do think that it missed some of the
things like some of the debate moments
the debate moments are very very funny
right um but I do like how it explains
it breaks it down it goes through it I
think it's even better than chat TPT
when it does this as well all right then
we talk about the funniest cloaks blonde
lundra I've seen Pelicans play better
than them from Sydney that was in
reference to Elijah his IQ is about the
freezing point of water in Europe that
was one of the funniest quotes I I will
say to that you to split switch but hey
you're all right so bad at this it's
almost an AR the volleyball team would
have won with just a fought chapter 22
page 130 um yep that is a funny quote
and yes AI did write that because I I
didn't come up with that all right the
Alex St and the machines were hacked
satellite internet Terminals and hanging
CH charge in the Deep State Elijah
chapter 26 page 149 yes that is funny
what are you doing on the floor anyway
um I asked the teacher if it's okay to
throw a Hydro Flask at him and she said
it was okay so I did it Molly chapter 23
page 134 that is funny that's an actual
quote so um well quote is quiet with
your boy math Ethan Shay I'm going to
teach you some politic math tax valy
chapter 23 page 132 so you know it has
some coaching that even I forgot about
and I even you know wrote the book as
president I will promise I will never
give you up I'll let you down e chapter
27 page 152 so grock did a great job of
scanning through all this um fighting
all references in here now I did ask for
some funny debate moments it keeps
talking about the blonde dring thing
blond dring is funny but is it really
funny enough to you mentioned three
times you be the judge of that gr all
right Ethan Ro Elijah's IQ we've already
been through this the final debate ever
is floating with the che leaders and he
gets tackle that that is funny all right
there was World scating ring eing calls
out the puppet
candidates um there is there is
investigation uh Sydney's media chaos
Etc ETA maybe I'll showare this yeah I
can share this with you guys so you guys
can read through this so um because it
keeps repeating some of the things but
it is funny it it is f funny things so
um then we asked to do some analysis so
essentially analyze outside of the book
and actually figures out how the
analysis actually worked in real life of
course you know this didn't actually
happen I ever go on speed high speeded
chases with people uh like I I wasn't
going on some electric scooter I having
electric scooter I don't live in the
woodlands so this book is like all
fiction but the SS ltw series is not
fiction right it's
true uh historical fiction I guess but
it actually does compare and contrast
the relationship between e and Allison
predict that they be FRS later after the
election it does a pretty good job of
what's to be expected so um it Compares
how they um similar and I didn't even
think about this they both have
leadership uh ambition they both want to
be pogus right um and it even sites what
it stands for um chapter one page seven
where Allison 13 year V steps as in
president M Lisa's Legacy chapter 5 page
26 strategic minds they both have
strategic uh abilities and you know you
know Alison really wasn't supposed to be
written to be the Mastermind of
everything there's supposed to be Marly
Mary is supposed to be like the villain
strategic villain but it even find some
things where Allison has done here so
you know we find of course s and GNN for
s for Ethan Shay and of course uh
allying with Geneva but then we also see
you know the plan witha that is kind of
hidden undercover Allison does make that
plan r as a vote splitting decoy and she
does lean on Mar's aggression um and
Val's media interference right you even
see some of the citations in here you
can gohe and you guys can go read the
book by yourself chapter 5 page 31
chapter 23 page 134 of course since this
is a draft might be a bit bit off on
whatever e says the crowd appeal they
both have Charisma they both have
speeches the fundraisers and prom and
free events Etc um the resilience they
both left the storms both their Ries are
attacked and they neither of them drop
out all right then you have the differ
experience you know Eon 12th grader new
new Addison 13 year veteran Vision scope
um what we're talking about is to be a
president of all glor and wide band
versus narrow band andon laser focus on
Trum narrow band right there it even um
SES narrow band right there at on the
page chapter 4 page 18 so it's really
getting into
this now it does accuse eon of driving
on spectacle accuses Allison of being
kind of institutionalized Eon brass on
hin blonde laundering
retor which it does get conf confused
Eon and who called him a blonde laundry
so that is that is something but we've
never seen this level of analysis of
this book I've done it in multiple AI
platforms chat PT claw I don't think
co-pilot allows foul uploads like this
and then the moral
compasses it does accuse you playing
dirty but it says with just cause
exposing the r attack I wouldn't think
that was playing dirty like spying on
the people it would it be illegal what
do you guys think to spy on a high
school candidates campaign as long as
you don't break any laws what do you
think that that is that that's your
question for today all then it accuses
Allison of being complic in Shad your
moves though I believe and I wrote the
book so I get to pick whatever I want I
believe that it just basically plays uh
Allison as you know she's focused on
other things while Molly and Valerie are
just you know vicking the election uh so
she's not really complicit but Gro
thinks she's complicit so you know who
am I to stand or who am I to argue with
grock I mean sure I did write the book
but who am I at AR gr all right do you
think they'll be friends after the
election so after it breaks it down for
everybody I'm just checking see if any
chat messages no chat messages all right
if it breaks it down for everybody it
says that they have mutual respect post
election right the victory speech I will
not seek retribution etc etc and his
says good luck face ability they both
have a passion for Glory high they have
real life friendship Q which is
basically basic off the prologue I'm
friend of all the people in this book in
real life Etc uh and in high school
Amnesia teen Dr Fage
fast
true
is the chaotic win alon's grateful
concession so it gives me some real
Reasons I'm going to three of these the
passion the mutual respect and high
school Amnesia I'm not going to pick
that one because that's basically
cheating and it says lingering
resentments classing Styles power
dynamics and then it basically takes all
of this and it says that they become
casual friends not be obsess friendly
enough Le towards reconciliation I say
yes that's absolutely absolutely correct
all right so we G to move in um the cats
in the Goldfish moment it thinks this
book was written before June of 2022
2024 which is no um then you have the
debate chaos
um blonde La keeps going on and on about
blonde Laing good grief and then I ask
him to rank the characters by their
intelligence and I think it does a
really interesting job so we have Ethan
Shay ranks them but he's the most
intelligent I mean thank you I guess uh
he says he builds SSA he launches D the
K of hwk news he allies with Geneva his
VI investigation and C that database he
out much Allison voice Ving F and he
returns chaos throughout the attack into
campaign fuel winning
the well did he win who knows um someone
wins the election 226 to 140 um proving
that they are no fluke so there we go
Ethan shay nine out of 10 I think it
gave him a nine out of 10 it gives him
and then it lists the evidence here have
my own spy agency I established a link
between the elite eight and Hawk news I
will unlock up half to
self-determination um chapter 25 page
144 gives him a score of nine out of 10
only losing a point because of paranoia
of R national security threat page
chapter five chapter 25 Allison is a
shrewd veteran leveraging her 13-year
tenure see even they they count the
point of her uh you know working with
Vera to split the votes and she says
quote I have a vision for the school
chapter 25 page 143 GES her a score of
eight out of 10 but two two VD should
that fully so essentially what thinking
is Elijah's Kaa Ethan's chaos campaign
is so good that Allison you know hasn't
been been able to keep up so only docks
two points off that again I think this
is smart but I was expecting to see Mary
and Geneva and
uh Valerie up here a little bit further
but you know it actually sees the
character development that Allison has
that I definitely intentionally put into
the book it's not accidentally a good
book obviously and then me up Geneva
smart enough to Pivot from presidential
hopeful to
bro are are you just going to site EB
songs present hopeful something
something St and Tru s whatever uh to
ean's VP securing Toad the votes um
chapter four and it says I saw something
in you you endorse AA and make me your
VP you done more for me than I could
ever imagine chapter 26 page 1457 out of
10 strategic but relies on E's momentum
which is fine okay this this isn't the
book about Geneva and her friends okay
this isn't this isn't gcam and the uh
the no this is Ethan Shay's election all
right and then we have valy I thought it
might have valy up there as number 10
because like in real life uh you know
manipulating teachers to waste class
time that Yap about John The Book of
John is pretty smart it's wrong it's
it's wrong and I condemn that fully but
it was funny to see this smart Catholic
kid pretending not to know who the
Apostle John was for 25 SEC 25
minutes okay
um anyway Valerie he a sneaky reporter
with HW news and possibly Le eight she
orchestrates the valley attack she says
I'm a reporting M what can I do spark a
war life fting from a disaster so they
think that Valerie's execution was
sloppy so they only gave her a six which
is wild I thought her execution was
pretty good in the
book but you know what do I know it's
not like I wrote this book and we say
Molly this it's fine I actually I
actually can see this because it's not
like Mary did much I mean the debates
were funny
and she is violent so I I guess gr
doesn't think that violence is smart so
um if you smack kids in the face with
Hydro flasks and if you throw shoes at
them you I guess you get I guess you
lose points um here so that's that's do
all right um Elijah again funny right he
the AF about this elect stolen satellite
internet terminals Freedom through
communism he's created for cluess yeah
true there we go there's a and for some
reason he gives Denver a three a three a
three I mean he doesn't even talk much
so I think what's Happening Here is yes
I think the beginning analysis um top
five from M to Eon Shay was actually
smart was actually well thought out but
then Elijah and actually Elijah but
Denver here he just doesn't talk much in
the book so they're not gonna think he's
very
smart um like asking what bushes
sir um okay I'm I'm pretty sure that
Denver is a lot smarter than this guy
was over here running a communist
election in a Christian school but what
do I know okay um a two out of 10 is
crazy now it was ranking them it's not
giving them IQs so that is good then
when you get to the funniest Elijah
communism in a high school election Ying
about crop tops and stolen lexon taking
TR and satellite internet terminals is
actually kind of funny so give him line
out of 10 Ethan Shay dead pan absurdity
I don't know how attacking drones is
thing but here's a message to Christie
also again chrisy look Ethan sh here got
a two for his quote dead pan absurdity
this proves that you don't need a
flannel you don't need a camera and you
don't need any of that to have dead pan
absurdity and Ethan Shay is just better
at than Matt Wallace in this book and in
real life at at dead pen okay so let
this be a lesson to you and if you're
live posting at me right now I will post
back okay oh wow she liked the post well
you know we're cooked
cooked at least more more people in the
United States can find your country than
all the people in your country so
there's that let that be a lesson to you
anyway half of his spent eating the cats
and the Goldfish I promise I'll will
never give you up I you know just the
line eating the cats and the Goldfish
should
be should should should give you more
points but you know I do agree with
Elijah Marly marly's violent violent
pettiness that I mean is kind of funny
going on throwing Hydro Flask at people
and asking for permission that that is
funny so yeah there we go sitney
again uh I guess she's she's not
intelligent because she didn't even get
ranked so uh sorry syney s you created
your own web show but but you know
you're not smart you blonde
La all right anyway um
Valerie yeah she's kind of funny in
small doses but she's she's all business
and Allison she doesn't she's not that
funny denu again denu not funny because
he doesn't talk much in this book H I'm
not sure how getting just Sho smacked is
is your fault I mean sure he did Poison
her water but whatever and then even
makes it into a table which is so smart
jbt would not do this it makes
intelligence funny and gives some quick
notes and I guess jifa doesn't have
Comics oh
okay so the smartest and funniest Ethan
dbest and funniest Elijah smart but not
funny Allison funny but not smart Marly
all right there we go and then I asked
it to give me some to edit some stuff y
y y we're not going to say through all
here and then actually tries to give me
the infer popularity trend of the
election which is great um from the
arrival until you see the numbers so you
see five 70 I guess they have no
popularity 30 60 10
15 how how can you have 115% popularity
if Allison is 60% popular in the poll
could you imagine
if had you know people up there runting
elections you know hitting the
TVs you know no like all right president
Elijah has 10% popularity in the polls
of Allison with the commanding lead of
60% and Ethan Shay has the remaining 30%
but also Vera somehow has 15% it just
doesn't
exist in it's an imaginary number all
right um Ethan shes catching up in the
polls with 40 40% Addison fell down 5%
Elijah St steady at 10% and at 15% which
gives you extra 10% that somehow doesn't
exist around here all right and then you
say at the debate in chapter 20 Elijah
no Elijah has risen to 15% Vera also
rising to 20% out of 15% and now Ethan
and pres Allison are tied how can you be
tied at 50% and then you have 35% here
and you show the percent percentages
toward end 62 38 5 and five I think
that's from internal numbers because
those numbers makes sense and look good
oh let's see I'm getting tweeted at oh
no okay all
right and then they gives some ex it
gives some uh explanations let's get
here so in chapter 20 the first debate
Ethan ties Allison because of his cats
and goldfish from Mark and attack
accusations Crow buzzers Al with her
blond Laing FL weaken her um Elijah's
just there ver gain from uh visibility
siding from page 31 very skating r kind
of why just think that the skating RN R
if you had an attack at a skating RN
like that that's just s and you have the
final debate and final rattling and you
can try I try to make it make a line
graph it doesn't do that and then I ask
which debate for the funniest so the
hawk news presidential debate um eating
the cats and eating the gold fist it
thinks that's the funniest of course
it's gone on about this for like five
times but fine they have the vi rer
skating link ratty which isn't a debate
so gr gr still messes up the final
debate R um what rtion is on about it
and then I say all you CH just look fine
and then they get tackled here the
puppet candidate polling numbers are at
1% 1% does that look like a 15 or a five
grock does that look like a
15 ver I'm not so fake hash I'm so real
and then e and ever combined together to
say we're reaching levels of corny I
didn't think were're
possible
because I think that's a mess up because
I think it's suppos to be Elijah never
because why would eon F ver
and um so he really likes eating the
cats eating goldfish blonde laundering
line because it's been going on about
that for five minutes um and we asked
about crushes and it get the vibe from
the book no I even ask deep it sees no
romantic evidence which makes gr smarter
than literally every high schooler in
America okay you take one picture next
to one person and you be like oh my gosh
are you guys dating are you people
insane like what's wrong with you people
okay or like be analyzing oh wow they
they unfollowed each other on Instagram
break up a loot break up a loot but Gro
grock is smart okay even from all the
accusations Gro can see
accusations and it can say no there's no
proof of these of these accusations so
if Gro 3 existed when I was in high
school uh we would have use this as
liation all right anyway we say uh then
we ask about blond gate it asked you
know all
the we I guess it lists all the blonde
characters no Alison it's not blonde I
guess it didn't see the artwork for the
book all right great let me see the top
speeches in the election I do like how
it sides the speeches off so I'm going
to read these speeches out to you guys
and you guys can think do you think it
rings the Spees also it really loves

disappears no cpan s quotes now it does
get this wrong the seasman as quote is
essentially referring
to Ally president Aly in the last debate
with him says something like uh you
don't like women and then Ethan says I'm
like yes I do I have a whole team and
she's like oh buy this schol and like
then Ethan says wait why are you cting
random cpan as quote so alie's the one
over here citing cpan quote um there's
also a quote from some 2000s movie in
here all right memorability cold heart
facts most incredible prom or Punchy and
Jal state has unig
state of GTA was crumbling in this book
it does not link the this speech to
essentially an entire attack on Addison
like it does not link the speech to yes
we're gonna have prom yes we're gonna
make money and yes Addison was terrible
about this U oh it does right there
right there yeah so yeah great job all
right here's the next final spe Elijah
kickoff speet good day GTA my name is
Elijah I'll be running for to be Supreme
communist dictator free food free food
iow animals in the school change the
dress C to crop tops eliminate half TOS
in the book include middle school and
expand electorate freedom of Communism
or something thank you GCA it just
thinks it's funny because and Ethan says
victory speech you guys can go read that
for yourself in the book Addison's final
R speak thank you ver the selection
students want to continue the legacy of
President Lisa but even bigger than
better or you want to gamble on oned
territory with an untested unproven
candidate I've been here for 13 years
and I'll fight for you on behalf of all
of you and while e will only fight for
power have a vision for the school to
Advantage into the future I want all of
you to have the best PR you can possibly
imagine that is why I humble asking for
your vote it's strong but losing it
thanks Vera it's stri it's un unleash
but it's strong and concise with V's
backup all right so that's what I think
is the best speech I would I would say
yes that this this is exactly what I
would say I do think that Gro would be a
great friend because you know it it is
on it understands IND sequencies into
his book not as much as I would like it
to but a lot better than Chad gbt with
it stupid responses about this book I
mean I've talked Tob about this book and
it's basically getting the same thing
also I I'm not getting any errors I'm
not getting timeouts this the same check
and I ask what worlded religion play in
this in this book
and uh we talk about upholding the
Constitution uh besid there being no s
document uh speeches it's all in God
bless you uh casual mentions um it does
get this mention from this debate fol
it's a Christian School use statistics
uh that's from the blonde Laing thing
Val is God blessed from that's School uh
news and E's wart and God we trust trust
us players Battle
Cry What In God We Trust is not in the
United States
pledge but okay
um and then ask R and character
motivations it isn't a deep personal
driver for the characters which I find
to be interesting but it does rank rank
e say most Christian I guess I guess I
guess he thinks he's playing the game
whatever all right satirical lens PL
impact campaign tone overall all right
let me ask the tape it doesn't ask and
then it gets confused about the tape so
this is the November 9th tape right it
doesn't know what I'm talking about
there then we try to ask all right so
here is the
movie so I'm going to scroll through the
first draft
because oh yeah that's that's the this
is the first draft of the movie so it's
so short is so short wait how could this
be a mov
if if you can read your entire movie on
a podcast that's sad all right here we
go so I ask it I have not seen this yet
but it's saying this movie should take
two hours 120 Minutes 120 Pages worth
now I don't know how supposed to fit 120
pages in there but here we go this is
saying that this First Act is 40 pages
called Act One the new kids gam and I
think we have a lot of work to do here
uh a lot of
work
right here first it gives me the camera
shot so that's great day one at goria
Christan Academy I'm e sh and I got a
mission I don't know why he's setting up
e like this is a vlog like why is he
pulling up in a car and like live
streaming
himself um but it does have that I guess
the
oldfashioned uh intro he hops out cam
panning CH to a n trips into a locker
which if this is inside why did CH just
dancing like isn't like in all the high
school movies they're all supposed to be
like outside but whatever in principal
Harris 50 Stern bar orders okay uh First
Impressions feudal system she a nobility
Jo Knights noja SS I'm the Vogue Knight
here to storm the castle I I don't know
why I turned this book into
uh
1300s esque story okay this isn't a
romantic story there's literally no
romantic Intrigue in this book at all
and apparently people throwing footballs
inside the school so you know this book
is supposed to be a bit outside of
realism this just
is like
what okay and then it cuts to uh at some
table Jo On wrestling L trading Pokemon
cards again this was never in the book
okay this is a 100 this a 100 plus page
book there's more than enough uh
information in here for GR to make a
readable story like I said this expand
maybe we could focus a bit more on Ethan
s's home life you know have a bit more
interpersonal
interactions but it's just what and then
Denver comes in he says hey you're new
right sitting solo Denver 14 braces a
slides over with a tray of Saki
fries okay Ethan sh yeah new you nth
grade saw you scoping what to phone and
Ethan says great and then Ethan just I
guess says Spicer from running for pres
Focus we need agents for the sh spy
agency which is definitely not what SSA
stands for you and then he says
president of what SSA and we go through
here
and I guess he Zooms in how big do you
think this lunch boom is like
he yeah that's that's definitely
realistic definitely happen and he cuts
to the Miss Scott student council
kickoff Friday Alex's November 9th

fundraisers Unity God bless J why why
would he say that but okay V smoks
typing fairly Ethan Addis across the CT
whispering to mly royalty's plotting
there we go again with the same royalty
theme um and then then was just like
hanging around so yes this entire X
suppos take 40 minutes you can't take 40
minutes when you cut 10 pages off of
everything okay so the entire Act is
supposed to be like what to page 36 you
cut 10 pages out twice so you only have
uh 16 pages
and not 16 full pages of dialogue
because some of the pages on description
it's more like eight pages and these
people are delivering dialogue into one
and it's more like this let's skip act
two so we can read act three oh my gosh
act two is literally a paragraph Mar CSM
tap tape leak uh skating rink pile up
lunchroom low basketball bust this is
not a script this is a PowerPoint final
debate rally election night victory and
then you have the expanded notes God
bless
Etc so uh grock may maybe get a bit
better from that but it is really great
at coding really really good at coding I
was able to get it to code some type of
game unfortunately I start to get like
code code that could generate
amaz not amazing not amazing at all but
you know gr really interesting here look
nice look at SS ltw best analysis I've
ever done so far don't have the
application yet oh you have some more
things to talk about so
so let's see if I can find
my see
from thech or then
do
okay I what this Teen Movie
all right let's see if I can
find the
quote I'm trying to find the quote of
these kids from some team mov
uh ah yes 2B so everyone knows about
the Fe
8 me
see let see if I can sech stream my
media why is it not searching in
order I
it let's see if I can find it social
media
ah here it
is oh nope not again I need to find the
caption oh here it is
so yes you know in those teen movies
where they have those they have the teen
girl and like her two Secret Service
asent friends and it's like she's kind
of mean but he has like those one he has
like that one friend who like kind of
stands around with her oh this reminds
me of one thing there's this movie
called zaap hopefully I can see you guys
on this thing movie called zaap and this
person gets power to control
boys and what do you do with such power
do you use it to become student council
president forcing every boring into
to um vote for you do you use it
to you know become president of the
United States essentially rewriting the
Constitution to allow 16y olds to run by
getting all the male Congress members to
vote Yes getting on the radio and then
causing a Constitutional Amendment which
will cause all the male voters to say
Yes um
getting required amount of states to say
yes and then convincing the Supreme
Court that it's legal by getting on the
radio they hear it on the radio and they
say and they say yes and you have this
app and you run for president you get
all the votes you
need because you know you get all the
men to vote for you no no no no that's
not what you do okay do you get it no
this person use it entirely and I I kid
you not to get people to clean up their
room and
then uh like get some boy likeo kind of
or you also get people to have good
dance moves yes that that that's great
absolutely great yes use the most
powerful technology in the history of of
um of
Earth to
um to allow people to like you a bit
more absolutely
ridiculous absolutely ridiculous
I'm gonna
why
why
um let's see if I can
find my Instagram story because these
people are just
stupid wait where is it I'm trying to
find this story
about
uh oh I think
it's oh here it
is yes guys here it is from the tech War
media from alley not be sty different
alley I'm GNA show you guys this on the
screen there's now an app where you can
review your ex-boyfriends and I can't
see this going well I mean the power of
high school jupit crit has extended past
12th grade now if there application
where you can review
ex-boyfriends I mean it's over people it
is so over
reviewed just why why would any man be
on that app like why I mean think about
it this is s what happens in high school
VI
iMessage well great the power of gcam in
high school extends even further to the
30s with the day
daying I mean why is it when people get
this exponentially great technology the
internet or in this movie this app that
allows you to control
men I mean this one kid has a tiny bit
of ambition right she gets these people
to bring her in on a chair and see for
some reason gets the entire men in the
basketball arena to bow down to her
which is again what a waste of power all
you have you have this power to
literally be able to run the world with
that
and you and you have the power of the
internet to to do great things and yet
you use it to rank men and
um I guess get them to date
you what a waste an absolute
waste and um not to think that women are
that men are exemp from this right sure
these fictional women are using this to
you know get men to clean up their rooms
and rank them but men are also using
this technology the internet to look at
random women from other
dictatorship countries that are cold and
probably quite lit threatening United
States national
security absolutely
ridiculous all
right so we can talk about this next
image later God bless Tech talk</pre>
