<h1>This a week In TheTechBoy Podcast 617(8)23</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
we are live hello and welcome to the
this week in the tech boy podcast today
we're going to have a special q a stream
we're going to talk about tech news and
the tech boy media and I'm actually
wearing a special shirt I designed a
service to Tech Floyd media
um
that's as high as it goes and then we're
going to react to one video that I tried
to react to over Loom it didn't work so
let's get into your Q and A questions
all right so your first question one of
them was uh how do you manage a school
and uh work
and the answer to that is that actually
was one of my first questions that was
asked on my keys for kids radio
interview and the correct the answer for
that is
I mean I'm just kind of good at school
and I actually listen to you uh it's
your girl saying during a some doing
some school book while managing Tech
work at the same time so yeah yeah
that's one of the ways I manage Tech
work and school at the same time also
you can write articles in between
classes
um
and just generally get research in via
the internet as well
okay the next question comes from
someone over on NTB which is driving for
gas or electric cars and gas and the
reason there's one
um
if
the infrastructure is not there and if
you ever got cyber attacks if I say
China then no more electricity for us no
more cars for us it's over and another
reason is if you're like going up the
hill and you get stuck in front of the
gas right you can go down to the gas
station or you can even bring gas with
you and you just put in put in the car
and you'll be off if you're electric you
can't bring cans of electricity with you
you can't go down to the electricity
charging station and go get electricity
and come back up the hill and get it so
you're also pretty much lost right there
[Music]
um
oh
and one more question over from Barry
Johnson which is actually a very
important question
uh he asked me to Define
he asked me to Define what woke and
based mean so I'll start with the easy
one based it just means uh I think based
in reality fun fact I thought it meant
biased it was the first time someone
called me that so I was like huh of
course it's biased but
um
it just means based in reality or
generally into vernacular oh it's a good
thing good thing and I would say
I would say that woke means like
super for a leftist
simplest terms
I would say it can be used as a verb uh
like something that you can do and it
can also be used to describe someone so
an adjective
and
yeah so if I look and an adjective it
can be used to describe someone and
something that you can do now on to our
Tech topics of today from techboy.org
the tech boy Samsung M8 versus M7 of
course our leading uh post again
but we talked about a lot this week we
did our q a
um just now and we talked about pix kit
which
I think yeah
um oh yeah speaking of 15th
um tomorrow when I'm recording this it
will be Father's Day so happy Father's
Day to all the fathers out there and I
tell them Happy Father's Day for me
um five problems with decks we'll get
right into that first of all YouTube's
not playing edit tabs so if I want to go
to this video and play it I can't go
into decks
I can't read this article I have not put
in the background
um at least in Samsung internet which is
the best blouse of the decks
um as you can see you have this nice tab
layout you got the URL bar at the top
bookmarks everything's laid out properly
it's just super nice
um no inspection in your desktop class
browser as you see I'm trying to inspect
and you cannot do that I know unusual
land has Firefox on it but 2.99 and so I
can't use it because I don't have a
dollar 99 so
if I could I would external camera
support no external camera support look
I'd be doing different stream yards if I
could but I can't that's why I'm using a
screen recorder
um Team streamlabs Zoom if they could
just all get external camera support X
being more viable
you know and virtualization support and
passwords management also should get
improved and speaking of virtualization
I think that if Samsung is included a
desktop version of Chrome or Chrome OS
in here would be much better honestly
what they should do is scrap decks but I
scrap it I mean don't like leave it
behind but use it as an emulation menu
just so you can import all your Android
apps into like Chrome OS and just plug
it in and get Chrome OS on here uh a
desktop Chrome browser better file
system probably and I would be very
productive and you can still use decks
and whatever well if you don't need a
full desktop environment like say for
the inwell or x-rayl ar glasses
um they just plug into your phone and
use
um and then pix kit it's another photo
editor
um I want to show you guys how to do
stuff with it but I think what is an
underrated video editor which I used on
my uh recent what I I like about the
Samsung Galaxy s22 plus video from
yesterday
um featuring the little AR animated
characters
um from Samsung AR was the um
sorry about that it's a video editor
called
inshot I think
no not inside sorry uh
shot cut shot cut let me bring it up on
the screen so you can see it it has
really good transitions
um uh hopefully you can see it on screen
it has good transitions um you can see
those transactions being used in my
video I will put it in the description
below uh make sure to ring that
notification Bell like and uh
make sure to make a notification Bell
like And subscribe to this YouTube
channel of course when you're going down
into those notifications
um
yeah it's underrated I think it has good
transitions there is a watermark on it
but you can watch the 30 second
advertisement to remove it one time and
then I think it's like a subscription
function too most of the funk features
are free but if you want more advanced
features like clonworking which is
screen screening
um you can use it but if I ever need to
Green Screen something just editing
there and green screen over Numa Fusion
because that's free
all right
um
it is a like a minute long YouTube short
show you know I'm actually going to show
it to you guys right now and then we're
going to be reacting to uh Katie Brooke
who's probably about my age it's my
third time reacting to the video but I'm
gonna KD and book on two different
people be reacting to it uh
again
all right here we go
podcast aesthetic um so don't leave a
study going got 17 views on the video
no views like come on guys watch these
shorts and thank you for watching uh
these shorts over 3 000 views
approximately
things I like about the Samsung Galaxy
s22 plus number one camera mode
did you see that transition that it just
came in that was uh
uh from interact so
I think it's a really good transition it
looks very professional what profession
on those lumafusion transitions my
goodness
do we have three camera modes like
portrait video glitch mode and the
three-time zoom mode these are very
amazing and I like them a lot number two
software Samsung includes amazing
features such as secure folder stackable
widgets and direct dial cartridge for
more customization options you can use
good luck another thing I like about my
s22 plus and of course that Graphics
included for free this is included
and I'm recording a Samsung it's the
large 6.6 inch screen now I wish it was
a bit wider but having an expansion
screen makes it great for multitasking
abilities speaking of multitasking
abilities that's another feature I like
about Samsung I like the YouTube picture
in picture split screen mode and the
pop-up merge that Samsung includes and
last but not least I'm going to turn
right on my eyes closed and the fifth
reason I like about this Samsung Galaxy
s22 plus is Samsung Dex I stopped using
my lap and speaking of this image I'm
now uploading pictures to unsplash you
can't really upload screenshots because
the required pixel 3 over 5 megapixels
or more but check me out onto blast I'm
uploading Tech photography so if you
like that kind of things and want to
download them and add them to your own
website feel free
about a week ago and have been
exclusively using Samsung decks it has
its works but the feature is amazing and
I believe every phone should have video
up support I think and yes I do believe
every phone should have video out
support
um there are simply no reason to spend
one thousand dollars on the phone
899 dollars on the phone and not have
video output if I had bought a Google
pixel one when I was planning on
upgrading for my a71 5G but it was
losing uh signal I I almost got a pixel
7 Pro and I was like no no and slight
tangent pixel super pro is kind of
overpr right we're not overpriced like
it's a good phone it's good for the
price but I don't know maybe the pixels
haven't undercut it but like all you're
paying for is a Budget Battery but large
screenshot on it evened out but it's
like probably slightly better battery
life on larger screen 6.7 6.5 and then
the telephoto zoom camera you get the
same software features same chip
same everything and I guess you could
also make the same criticism for the
Samsung Galaxy s23 Ultra and the s23
plus but you do get an additional zoom
camera uh S Pen
same chip but you also get a curved edge
and a larger screen so the only
difference is you get the S Min and a
large screen uh pixel but it is a 300
jump
um I don't think you get any extra
storage options
um correct me if I'm wrong with Samsung
you do you can get up to like 512
gigabytes of different storage and
well I guess the lower model is a bit
more colorful but you know there's that
like red model from the Samsung store
um but I digress like the the pixel 7
pixel 7 Pro OnePlus 11. like those those
phones are probably pretty really fast
the cameras feel really good on the
pixel 7 Pro
um it's probably not as jittery or laggy
or whatever
um and I probably wouldn't have put up
with stock Android instead of one UI no
more Bixby and what like no more secure
folded as an app that can kind of
replicate it for you I would really want
to put up and use it but no no decks no
video out there was actually no video
out on
uh the OnePlus 11 on Pixel 7 Pro unless
you have a Chromecast device or
something like that which is just insane
like even the LTV 40 I think supports
video out can't test it now because I'm
streaming from that
um
and iPhones they support that too but of
course it would infringe on
uh their iOS business iPad OS and Mac OS
they'll never add it
um but certain phones will say like the
uh
like probably some beefos or
even some older onepluses I think they
support video right now they don't have
oh and Sony like they don't have a
proper desktop mode but one banknote has
a video where you where you can convert
those phones into
actual desktop computers like Sam uh if
you're selling at the build those
desktop mode but like Google if they had
added that I might have considered
getting uh pixel 7 that might have
gotten that because I heard the battery
life is good uh pixel and pro rather
because the screen's bigger uh it has
all the split screen features you can
always like download some type of launch
that makes it look like one UI
uh some of Samsung Tabs are still in the
Play Store like Samsung internet and
calendar Etc
I haven't been able to make it work but
no desktop mode I just have to use my
laptop so I'm glad that they got that
and now for the final thing uh which oh
by the way I'm gonna be editing this in
uh shot cut
um we're going to be reacting to KD
reacting to this oh oh before we do that
before we get to our reaction I want to
show you guys
this beautiful post I did
and speaking of post
um speaking of post unfortunately Google
domains is going to be shutting down
within a year they got sold to some
company and that's not good that is not
good for the tech point at all
um
if the tech boy
there we go
oh 13 views on this
sweet
oh that's a nice share menu by the way
um the technical got its domain for
twelve dollars a year and they're going
to honor this for you so we're good
we'll we'll renew of course but if they
up the prices we're gonna have to switch
our domain over to someone else which is
going to be probably being a pain and
hopefully the site does not go down but
that is not good that Google's remains
has shut down but I just wanted to show
that with you guys all right great
here's a great post for you guys
um here we go
so remember to check that out we still
have other websites The Odyssey board is
still up and running the most recent
Adventures in Odyssey uh album is going
to be coming out it's July 13th I I
think so
uh expects to see some reporting from
that and without further Ado let's get
to KD
hello everyone my name is
Kate welcome
back from probably watching a few of my
shorts or some of my YouTube videos then
welcome back so today I'm with my friend
Brooke are you and today we're going to
be reacting to some crazy tick tocks or
woke big talks and I want to see which
we divide earlier in this video because
I already know what mine is first for
some context I think she's 11. going to
sixth grade and she's like 14 15. Maybe
an introduction of Who You Are
I'm Brooke and I am 11 and I and I'm
fifth grade
going into six soon yeah
yeah and I'll ask the tube today
you probably don't care
no I think she uses in shot to edit by
the way
this is
so threatening actually like she sounds
chippy but threatening at the same time
right
guess I'm not a person by the way
breaking breaking
my pronouns are they them and she heard
thank you so much for asking what are
yours okay that face
I have to say dismiss ma'am right she
just said oh I don't like people using
feminine pronouns for me like feminine
words and she said her pronouns are they
then she hurt
also she's like baby talking about all
the grains she's just like
oh I don't feel like a boy or a girl
it's like a person
am I a person are you not a person I'm
not a person apparently
what are your what are these on this
cringe
that's what I'm gonna say how would you
feel if she was your teacher
get out did you try to exchange classes
yes
[Music]
yeah way too excited
good sit down
thank you
my thing is my thought on this right
one I feel bad for that girl
I feel so bad for her like imagine you
someone a ton of people like want you to
be homecoming queen right dude the dude
probably wasn't about to get home from
the King
and also I at homecoming dance
no there's a homecoming King but what if
that homecoming king is dead oh
um
seriously school dances don't waste of
time and money and National Security
um
and she's completely and totally
absolutely right 100 agree with
I don't know
I'm Cody pronounced
um
temporarily mostly able-bodied
neurodivergent obsessive compulsive
chronically ill culturally Jewish
actual Survivor of acute and complex
trauma Millennial and Cat parent in
mental health
um
so you've been great for website like
design and SEO just adding labels and
boosting engagement but I
all those I have no idea but what what
phone just wanted everything under the
umbrella okay
I don't understand why do you understand
why why they wanted everything under the
umbrella so many terms and like listen
Millennials and freaking gems here just
like oh my God I don't want labels
your friends know what gender you're
feeling today gender fluid Edition okay
so that you don't have to do any of
these is it just things that I do
pronoun bracelets you can get different
colors PSA like I'm looking for advice
from someone
with different pronouns and for example
this one says this one says he him and
this one says the colors also they're
selling those scammy pit like my eyes
work
the spin the dollar buy a pin so I can
see it I can read it no I'm not that is
a scam you don't have a piece of water
cost you five cents honestly good
Ingenuity but no one pound feeling so
black usually goes to my black besides
who's gonna look at it he's gonna be
like oh excuse me I can't see ah okay I
see that great
no one um this usually goes with like my
pink female outfits and this usually
goes in the middle one outfit just a way
to let your friends know which one
you're feeling today and how they can
address
exactly that's exactly okay wow
from that thing
so girlypuff was just like um
why would you change every day
interchangeable it's not like you get to
go to your birthday and just be like let
me just change this real fast every day
yeah you can't even change it's dumb
well you can but like get to go through
a lot
my thing is a lot of people just like oh
my gosh
boys I love to like girl colors
girls are only allowed to like pink yet
people always will associate people
really what do I tell you about being
really late I called you three hours ago
is that an iPhone
it's kind of sad
people associate pink with girls look at
that
masculine when I'm feeling
um like a guy and I present more
Ambiguously when I'm feeling like a
non-binary and when I'm feeling like a
girl I usually well as a pig but anyone
can wear anything that they want to it
doesn't necessary to in London and
finally letting your friends know just
tell them
wow
is he kind of like contradicted yourself
within the first second third
first and second point and then the
girlfriend wow they're going to get very
confused very soon
okay
what are your thoughts on it
girl stick to skirts even though I'm not
wearing them in my earlier rooms yes
clothes do have gender if you go to a
store you can look for skirts you have
to look in the wooden section
it makes sense
so if you don't know me I teach middle
school and I get a lot of back and forth
on my 40 page about the generation
that's coming up now but I will say it's
one of the coolest things about this
generation is that they really have
tapped into who they are and what they
believe all the time
so specifically I have one student oh
I've had three but one student today
came up to me and told me that they
wanted me to change their pronouns and
they would prefer if I refer to them as
a different name and I was like yeah of
course like that's just the respectful
thing right no I've been in my mind I
was just like how cool is it to just
know that you feel a certain way and
that you want to be who you are I did
not have that kind of security when I
was in Middle School oh that's good but
like it just makes me really proud
um
no no no no no respectful in Middle
School are so far away from each other
you would need a GPS to find it there is
no way respect for middle school but no
if there's one constant right of out of
human history Middle School was never
ever without a shadow of an help never
ever respectful yeah
the kind of people that they're becoming
because they know what they want and
they know who they are that's really
cool to watch yeah I know
I know subscribers but I'm not gonna
just like
get it and I could edit that if Samsung
10 expect menu I could just type in 100
000.
[Music]
your brain doesn't really develop until
you're like 24 28 25. if you get talked
into something enough you will think
that thing's true to make sure this you
were told you were butterfly a million
times but here they had cancer a million
times even from a butterfly to cancer no
no proof right
if someone gets told that hey you're
trans a million times they're gonna
think that's the truth right there and I
want to start doing it oh by the way
lgbtq getting beats is a trend kids want
to follow Trends they don't know
themselves I don't know myself and I'm
like almost like an older teenager it's
weird
people go and try to find themselves
that will happen until they're like late
20s I hate going to school wearing
colorful things even though I want to
but I mean if I would have walked inside
of like a colorful bag that I may
actually really like they'd be like
proof Middle School's not respect
she's like in the elementary yeah and
stuff
hey everyone I don't think I've done
like a general introduction yet as to
who I am so I thought I would do that
now hi my name is bunny and I use fun
pronouns so who am I
I am a gender fluid trans fem
panromantic great race
