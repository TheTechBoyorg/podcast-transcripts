<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 11125</h1>
<pre>oh guys the Texans won as I predicted
and for the first time in Reddit history
I actually posted something was correct
and people actually liked it so let's
get into that for today and then we'll

today which is what is wrong with the
spy toys of America all right so first
of all let's go to um here we are over
on our Texans and I said hope it we'll
have more pics than uh he has had all

had um four picks he only had three
picks in the entire season so yes I was
right you know I was proven right you

Bowl so you know let's keep let's keep

everything that the tech boy is on
including Snapchat um so yeah make sure
you guys go check out that website there
now let's get into my main topic for
today and also our Tech headlines and
also last week's podcast episode we had
a few uh interruptions but they will be
going back up um soon but um number one
topic of discussion the OnePlus 13 was
released so hopefully you guys can see
this on the screen and we already have
some comments coming in Rolling In oh
you have a 16 Pro Max wow oh wait no I
don't want to block you I want to show
the comment here we go a 16 Pro Max
interesting interesting kind of sad that
you deserted Android but I'm glad you
updated from your what was it Galaxy a13
what about uh your friend does she also
have the uh 16 Pro Max as well oh first
house wow congratulations speaking of
someone buying their first house M who's
the boss um finally finished up his
Studio series spanning nine videos he
lives in England so um let's go yep the
Texans did win and like I was saying my
prediction I predicted over here on
Reddit that hobit would have more picks
than he had all season and and he had
four picks in this game three picks in
this season so yep yep I was right
everyone can um go applaud me I've never
actually been applauded for something um
online before you know it's always bunch
of random people over on r or X always
screeching or yelling at me anyway we
actually made $3 off of AD Revenue so
you guys can you know all clap for me
$369 to be precise it's really sad like
people are like oh my goodness he's a
grifter like I am sitting here getting
yelled at from these random people on
the internet
um yeah yep yep I do remember I do
remember I'm I'm sitting here getting
yelled at from these random people on
the internet and I'm not making any
money off of y'all so um you guys can
sit down and be quiet anyway here is the
OnePlus 13 um released the OnePlus 13
it's priced at $88.99 for the module of
12 gab of RAM and 26 gigabytes of
storage and in the moveie I've never
seen before this could just be the
pre-order thing that the 16 gigabytes of
RAM and the 52 gigabytes of storage
sorry 52 gabes of storage which
obviously you should buy is the same
exact price it's the same price so um if
you
that check it out I mean there's no
reason why you would buy a wor phone for
the same amount of money it's the exact
same amount of money so guys make just
if you want it buy it now this phone is
really interesting because it's it's
powerful all around has the world's most
advanced smartphone chip has a 6,000
Milah hour battery which is um you know
1,000 times bigger than the uh 1,000
Mill hours bigger than the Samsung
Galaxy s24 Ultra that I have
and you know I think the battery life
MKBHD said in the review that it should
last and get this two days two whole
days he said he could not kill it in a
day here my phone is it's dying in like
half a day now I did get um yeah IP 69
and IP 68 you know one plus is stepping
it up really really doing a great job
stepping it up um you know they used to
not have water resistant phones but now
it's 8.99 the only problem with there is
these cameras here and you might say oh
they look good but when we scroll down
into the article right is good for
social media use because as as you guys
know um the problem is that these type
phones have the Snapdragon H gen 3
mobile chip the world's most powerful
efficient chip in in the world for now
uh for phones right um but there's no
applications being made for it we've
gone through this multiple times you
guys can go back into podcast episode
you go into the Play Store right now the
number one app is still Tik Tok which
it's not Tik Tok anymore it's limit 8
which is a Tik tok's uh spin spin-off
app because they're about to get banned
by the uh Supreme Court in the United
States brought of justice so uh unless
it gets saved oh we have a question
coming in from the chat let's see hey
what TV should I buy for my living room
has three big Windows near so manyi LED
or
OED H that's a good question uh which
TVs are you looking at because it
depends on how much light how much light
comes in through the windows and uh
let's see if I can copy this text
in uh let's see the SD I'm sorry this is
the s 90d over just over 1K new so this
this was actually a good segue so um
make sure you guys check out the article
go read it yourself but Mr who's the
boss and you probably won't buy any of
these TVs because they're like thousands
and thousands of pounds but um Mr the
boss was actually buying some new
television for his studio in
his uh in his house over in the UK
Robert so
um you know if you if you have the cash
you know maybe you could check out some
of the TVs that we can show in in the
video if you would like you can put it
in the comment too but all right so the
SD um the s90d is only wow
$1,499 so I don't know whether that
would translated over to in pounds but
that's what it is it's a 65 inch
television I think that's what the size
I was is we have a LG television um
depends on of course you know what kind
of operating system you like you know
you got you know Samsung's tyon OS
versus the you know LG web OS versus you
know whatever stick you want to plug
into but here's the TV and this is my
local best bu here so um prices might be
different over in the United Kingdom
um let's see what we have so it's 4K
ultra high definition you know found on
most modern TV 65 inch TV uh
um which I I think that's plenty well
enough um we do have a window with r TV
but it's covered by blinds so I'm not
really sure how much light does come in
but light does come in through or would
come in through if we didn't C in and it
has L LED so it has high color accuracy
perfect contrast and it is a smart
television so that's good and it has uh
Alexa and Bixby uh I might have
triggered it over there oh and I
triggered both of them all right um so
it depends what are you gonna be doing
on this TV so it looks like a perfectly
good TV I mean I'd buy it if you know I
had $1,400 and I didn't already have
television but when we tap into the full
specs you know L 4K I mean that's
perfectly good enough I'm you know I'm
sitting here watching television shows I
mean it's it's amazing I can actually do
this watching television shows on my
cell phone with Prime video so I mean my
cell phone is kind of 4K
almost
um you know so let's see do you have any
comment oh let's see oh let's do a
comparison so you said the LG G4 oh
Samsung student just giving you 15% off
oh nice that's nice so let's see what
the LG G4 is because that's also a cell
phone so let's compare let's compare
with these televisions can do so I'm
going to go full screen here and I'm
going to keep the tab open it's at the
LG G4
gg4
TV all right this is also a 65 inch
television as well oh this is way more
expensive it's showing from Best Buy at
least
$99 here in the United States um so that
that there might be a thing that you
have to you know account for Hope here
is on the screen now LG's webest is kind
of slow on the TV like I said we have a
LG um television but this is what the
user interface looks like um it's it's
decent you know um some of these are
kind of kind of get boring but we mostly
split in between Netflix Prime and then
cable satellite television so it's not
like we're going to be on this OS most
of the time now if you are all in on the
smart TV Os or streaming OS you know you
might find it being laggy to be you know
different uh or more hindrance but
because we only use Netflix and Prime
video like Prime video right now is um
being used for the Steelers and Ravens
game to stream right it's fine because
you mostly use you know satellite TV
normal like cable television shows here
it looks like it's the same exact specs
or like same let's see what the full
specs are here 65 inches 4K um you know
120 refers refresher which is only
useful if you need to to to game yeah
yeah LG web is kind of slow I haven't
spent much time on handr of Samsung TV
so it's like I can't just go into a
store and use them but you know I know
people have them it looked it looked and
felt a bit faster to me but it depends
on what you want but for now I'd
recommend the Samsung television because
it's it I mean it's $1,000 off unless
you can get it you know cheaper over in
United Kingdom and it looks like it does
the same stuff 65 in and Samsung
software might be better if you want to
use the
full um Smart TV features all right so
he says he can get for 169 U the G4 and
1K at Cs and all these TVs just got
updated oh that's great it's great that
CS just got just happened because since
CS just has happened you know you can
wait until maybe February March because
then all these TVs are on start hitting
the stores it's going to start hitting
Best Buy and all the Tex stores here in
the United States and then all these
other TVs you can get them at discount
on on eBay or that site that you were
showing me last year on
um I forgot what the site was but it was
some website that you could use to buy
Electronics um in the UK now speaking of
electronics you know I've been looking
I've been looking into um um technology
technology that has been with us since
the 1940s technology like the humble
walkie-talkie would no Dolby Vision be
an issue I mean I can't really tell the
difference between Dolby vision and no
Dolby Dolby Vision I mean we switched
from televisions from like a non-smart
television like just off the shelf at
Walmart to some LG television that's a
smart television has you know the
features of this television I think this
one might even be it I'm not sure um I
have to see what the stand is but you
know if you're just a casual viewer I I
I wouldn't notice the difference um you
know
it's it really depends on what you're
doing on the TV are you going to be
using it for gaming um
I I don't game so I wouldn't know but I
mean the TVs look fine to me the only
thing I'm noticing is of course
different software so we don't have to
use a fire stick anymore because we use
the native LG webos and also you know
it's bigger like two times bigger
which would be different in your case
all right moving on to the
walkie-talkies um so this is a simple
walkie-talkie right you can talk to them
if there were batteries in it and also
if these worked I did give these bad
reviews I also gave this one a bad
review and I gave this one a good review
but it's not charged right now anyway
these are simple walkie talkies I see
you talking to it they come out um
speech comes out right but in the5 in
2005 right there was this company um
owned by hillsb called um Tiger
Electronics apparently that famous for
making like handheld video games in the
90s um but they were like one player
game so it's like one game so like you
want football it's one football game you
don't get to so they were kind of like
consoles and only had one game in it for
$30 like cheap electronic handheld
portable games so in 2005 they released
the
chat the chat now phone right and it's
not a phone it was a walkie-talkie that
looked like a cell phone um and you can
see this on the screen here they are
actually on eBay let me make sure it's
not going to show my address because
that wouldn't be good I don't want
random people here who want my great
knowledge too of great knowledge of
Texans and football and of course being
right all the time coming over to my
house and begging begging um for for for
my wisdom anyway
um here it is on the screen this is the
chat now communicators they look like
cell phones so there was one version
that kind of like flipped out here
someone called it like a blade like the
keypad SLS out and there was another
vers that flipped open like a flip phone
because that was popular back in 2005
and these are just simple walkie-talkies
right they look like that on the surface
we talking about
$79.95 back then they retail for about
$30 OR7 7 no $70 and it came in a pack
like this so about $30 each um and what
but what you can see here is the
interesting thing is remember 2005 not
the talking but the text messaging each
walkie-talkie actually had its own
10-digit quote buddy number and these
buddy numbers would allow you to call
people within a two mile radius range
now someone did do a test
um all right thank you hope you guys can
catch the replay and hope you find a
good TV that you
anyway um and thanks for coming in
anyway um back to the chat nouns like
you can see here it says no fees no
bills because it had two M alleged range
now someone did do a test it didn't go
that far but that was back in like 2020
so maybe you know the batteries degraded
maybe you know 15 years in the future
anyway you could actually send text
messages text messages over radio I
think it used the family Family Radio
Service FS so no licenses nothing
special right um you could send text
messages you could even take pictures
and animate them on on a small black and
white camera right you might be thinking
okay that's nice now what fast forward
back to two thou towards 2011 so six
years into the future um we get the I
spy links now ice spy is known for um
like this era is probably known for spy
you know had night Vis and goles Nerf
guns things like that coming out
um and this also allowed you to chat and
video call over radio waves is
completely a kids story you didn't need
licenses to sign up and maybe because of
the
um what's it called maybe because of its
by dual functions right you know the
video call with night vision which is
just a camera with infrared and you
could text and you could call you know
they had to cut down on the Range a
little bit so it's only 500 feet instead
of two mouse but you know it's heftier
has a more chunky antenna it kind of
looks like the Blackberry of its day and
this is the ice links live video
walkie-talkies surveillance technology
you could talk into it it had a headset
and you could chat into it look it has a
full quy keyboard any might you're
thinking okay that's nice that's nice
now we fast forward to like 2015 2016 we
have the Spy
um spy GE video walkie-talkies now these
only have 140 foot range but they are
much much smaller and they also double
as spy cameras right
and come on come on it's loading here
they are you could even buy these I saw
these in Target like six years ago it's
2025 so maybe seven years ago right I
saw them in like 2018 so this is the um
spyer walkie talkies here oh yeah 160
foot range communication no texting but
you did have video calling abilities but
you try to look for that now you won't
see anything like nothing right it it's
it's it's it's insane that toys like
this have not been made in 2005 we had
two mile capability to talk text and
take pictures 2011 we got talk text and
video chat and in 2015 16 we had video
chatting abilities um very small
portable you can hide them um they could
also be you know spy cameras as well
what's happened right and people say
that the rise of the smartphone caused
people to um you know not not have to
need this anymore like you could know
people kids if they want to play Spike
and video call on their smartphone well
that's fine that's fine I did my own
research I did my own investigation
right I went in I tried to find FCC IDs
of all of these toys I tried to find out
how they worked what kind of frequencies
that they use because think about it
they were able to sell these to kids for
$70 on TV right these were in stores
this would have been toys OS Target
Amazon back in 2005 they were able to
sell these two kids right this and in
2011 I went back and looked at their old
website and in 201 uh 16 I mean I
actually saw it in person in 2018 if
they were able to sell these and Market
these two
kids I mean we should be able to make
them now right like ice spy also
released a camera based on the same
technology um it had a
um uh it had a camera the ice spy
um that works on the same Principle as
the it's it's like a baby monitor that
doesn't work over Wi-Fi right so here's
the I spy camera
um I'm going to show what the camera toy
looks like here it is the ice spy spider
cam this came out at the same time as
the walkie-talkies hopefully you can see
this on the
screen then you have your module here
that shows the video data and then you
have your um camera here and they also
released a drone so they did all these
things based off of radio frequencies
right you would think that would be so
much EAS to make this today but
apparently if you want to go make a baby
monitor that works no
Wi-fi the instructions are hard to find
like I I typed it in let's say let's say
like go to instructables or something
like that like
make if you want to make a radio control
baby monitor right I was trying to think
okay we can do this and I want to send
text
over um how to
send texts over
over radio frequency right you if you
want to do this and you can just search
through um here's here's Google here let
me minimize it so here here's my Google
Search right the only things you're
getting here is some application where
you can I've showed this on the screen
before where you put up you type in your
text from your phone and then you um
type it in and it will translate that
text into sounds and then you'll send
the sounds over here and then someone on
the other end will record it with their
phone and they can decode right we've
done that with images right but I mean
at that at that point I mean you might
as well just talk into the radio right
if I wanted to make a small toy like
this right just take this take take this
take a
keyboard and and do that apparently
instructions are impossible to make if I
wanted to make my own baby monitor
that's not connected to Wi-Fi that's not
centrally like you don't need to
connected to Internet or anything or you
don't need to have a Wi-Fi Wi-Fi router
you just want peer to peer radio to
radio communic
apparently that doesn't exist like is
this technology patented or secret or
something is baby or baby monitor
companies threatened by people that that
can do this I mean is this is simple
technology I mean they were're putting
it in kids toys to crying out loud in
2005 I mean this technology has been
around for a long time and it would be
it would be so much better if we I don't
know looked into this apparently
untapped tech technology that we could
be harnessing for the greater good of
humankind think about it we could have
cell phone cases now I mean the
technology has to have improved now
think about it cell phone cases and a
special app maybe links via Bluetooth
where you type in and you can send
messages to anyone via radio signs and
radio Wes right and people are pointing
me towards this thing called Lova which
is low frequency radio and there there's
this one handheld Gadget thingy that
exist but it's like you have to code it
and it's it's not for kids right you
want to be able to you know if I wanted
to make these things maybe Market them
like like they did in 2005 right now you
have to have a kind of different
marketing thing maybe I could even go
for the whole oh you don't want your
kids on your phone marketing blah blah
blah thing right but you know you have
slight different marketing and these
things would sell these things would
sell and I think we could even put these
into high level Enterprise level
technology as well but no one seems to
have the want for it right we know that
Radio based video calling is Tech
technically possible I me we see it
every Dayan we see people calling in Via
satellites um to the news let's say you
have someone here and they're standing
here on ABC 13 standing at the scene of
a flood and they call in and it goes up
to the news truck and down links back we
we've been seen this since the 80s like
those man on the street reporters and
the little ear pieces that they have
right if if there's anything that has to
do with radio it's so hard to find like
little radio earpieces where you can
talk to someone they can talk back to
you we know those exist
we we know that we have the technology
to make them where is it radio video
calling would be insane think about it
you just plug a little dongle into your
computer you um then you get on the
right frequency as someone else and now
you can video call with them maybe
interface with some type of special
software it would be so much more useful
than have the um fiddle of Zoom
especially if you're like the same
vicinity as someone right I'm not saying
that you this this be really good for
internal stuff like people down the
street let's say you have a walkie
talkie like maybe you don't want to
bring your phone or maybe you just want
to keep keep it in your pocket or
something like that right you can take
your little um I spy um or chat now
Communicator go chat down the street you
can even video call back I mean it was
in kids toys from 2011 that means this
technology has to be improved on but you
cannot find anything um like it now
everything's like I guess has to be
connected via Wi-Fi and that's that's a
big problem like they to fix that and
that I I think we're seeing a lack of
innovation over in technology for
offline things like if you try it hard
enough you could have radio access to
another
computer like Microsoft Remote Desktop
without you know having the required
internet and maybe it could be even more
secure
or at least cheaper because you know you
have to pay for your ISP fee right and
speaking of Samsung and Innovation they
did try something Innovative it's
Samsung Smart select so as you guys know
oneui 6 and now persisting over to oneui
um seven um hopefully you guys can see
this on the screen um Samsung um changed
over the smart selects uh sorry not when
six when 6.1.1 I believe they changed it
to an AI Power Smart select so instead
of just a square and a circle and you
know we can record gifts or gifs or
whatever um on
it you can now it can now automatically
tack stuff but the problem is that when
you try to run it you try to take a
screenshot or something has text it
keeps trying to try to detect the text
that's on the screen and copy it and
paste and copy it and paste and copy and
paste it instead of try to take your
screenshot and it's also for some reason
more laggy and this is over on the s24
ultra which is Samsung's um well I mean
for a few more days latest and most
powerful phone that they have other than
like the zold six special edition but
the most powerful here in the United
States that's not a special edition
right so hopefully Samsung can get this
fixed in one your i7 beta this is not
just the beta problem it's a one your I
six uh problem as well oh Bixby Hood
what I saying hopefully Bixby is okay
anyway um it because it it it persists
on other phones as well so hopefully
they can fix this issue and it would be
great I'd also like to see maybe the old
one come back with circles with with the
circle because you know taking Circle
screenshots is fun but you know you can
always crop it down in post you know I
I'm a believer that once you put a
feature into a phone or into like a
product line you should not um remove it
like you know Samsung phones used to be
able to via
NFC tap your phone to someone else's
phone here via NFC and transfer files
back in 2012 now apple is doing this
with name drop and people were like wow
I mean Samsung should should have kept
that feature right I mean maybe people
didn't use it but it's not like it was
it's not like would cost the money to
keep the feature in their software you
know Samsung and Android as a whole used
to have Android Beam where you could you
know boom do the same thing and now it's
gone Samsung used to have you know some
features in Tyson you know like um eye
control you control your phone via eye
or hover not not just for the Spen but
keep your f finger over the screen and
it would hover and you could get more
information or keep the screen on when
you you know look at it um also you know
eye control um you know offline voice
control you know it's kind of hard to
get you kind of have to get one of those
applications now but back then because
the internet was slower you know it was
more Forefront you know sports mode in
cameras that was like on the Samsung
Galaxy S5 uh camera I think it's in this
drawer here so if you want I can
probably do a video about it um spch
mode on camera um obviously that's not
there anymore you know some other
features
like there's some other camera features
are over on the S7 and S7 Edge that are
missing now um like I think it was like
virtual kind of like do a 3D style image
speaking of 3D you know 3D cameras also
gone 3D screens also gone um and I'm a
firm believer that features once you add
them to a device right should not be
taken away especially software features
now I can see like maybe 3D cameras 3D
um screen that cost money for things
people weren't using but software
features like NFC file share or uh
looking at the screens to keep it on and
control it or hovering your finger over
the screen to get more um context
information or this is a big one having
Linux on deck on Samsung tablets and
then just removing that in Android 10
update for some dumb reason
or um special camera features in modes
um like sports mode it just like you can
change the UI but you probably should be
removing those features and speaking of
removing features there's a rumor going
around this is this is very very bad
that the Samsung gxy s25 Ultra Samsung's
most expensive slab phone um 20 the s25
ultra will come with an s pin but it may
not have bluetooth enabled on it it may
um according to the teor quietly dis
this spin feature which why would you do
this I mean you've had this feature
since you know BL embedding Bluetooth in
the s pin you've had this feature for a
quite a quite a while air drers which I
would use if my S Pen wasn't broken um
you know you
have uh take the remote shutter which is
probably the most useful feature that
that's on uh Samsung you know you take
the pen out you hold it you click it
boom remote shutter um you
have you know Bluetooth control and and
tracking and if they do this and people
don't rise up and Revolt and say no or
if it's I guess maybe an extra $30 if
you want one of the Bluetooth enabled
spins maybe they will moove the spin
from the s26 ultra um alog together and
then you will not have stylist this on
phones anymore and except for the budget
uh cell phones like the Motorola Stylo
that you can find like Best Buy or
places like that for um budget prices
which is which is which is not good like
we want to have premium stylist phones I
mean obviously Samsung wants you to pay
extra money for your slus but I don't
want have to carry around the slus I
want to carry it in my phone makes an
ultra and Ultra and a note a note and
hopefully Samsung does not keep removing
features like like I say removing
features like the SD card slot and
the
um wait wait the S the SD card slack and
the
camera and and and those camera features
and maybe even removable batteries in
some way shape or form
and uh what's that oh and and the
headphone jack I can't believe I forgot
about the headphone jack
um you know Samsung should not be
removing these uh features and maybe
next week we can talk more about that
and um things of that nature let's get
over to YouTube We Will We I have you
know some important things to say about
something else but maybe we could talk
about that in another episode maybe over
on the other channel May make sure you
guys go like And subscribe I I mean I
did predict the Texans were going to win
the Super Bowl and they they are on
their way
to I'm doing that let's check in with
the Steelers score zero to zero okay
anyway um over on YouTube um we're going
to be reacting to Mr who's the
boss and you guys can tell me if you are
really interested in the OnePlus 1 I'm
not going to pay $8.99 I don't have $899
to pay for a phone but maybe OnePlus
will finally send it to me maybe I can
actually be profitable from this
business like last week I me yesterday I
was I was going through the statistics
and congratulations we've had you know
lots of traffic coming to the website
but the ad statistics are terrible
absolutely terrible and I'm so yeah like
trash
$369 I'm sorry the domain for this
website cost $12 so we're under $9 not
technically because we have sponsors
sometimes and
um they have we made $100 off of one
sponsor which would pay for the
website seven times over but
$369 in like six months at at that rate
I might as well this this website I
would make more doing a minimum wage job
in eight hours in one day so that'd be
about
$56 at this point this website would
make it in um o
six I want to get the number right so so
I make about $6 in a year maybe even
seven I I make the same in eight hours
doing a minimum wage job that I would
make in eight years running this website
um at
$369 uh per six months so guys please
click on the ads and please click on the
affiliate links no clicks on the
affiliate links we did get one person
who brought maybe one or two people who
brought the books but that's not enough
to
have drafted digital you know B to
release my money to me it's only $1.79
so make sure you guys go um check out
the books as well also when our new
website media tech.org fines so it's
propagating from the old media. the
tech.org which is just old old looking
and built on Google sites and we're
migrating it to a link tree um and it
will show all our links so all the
YouTube links all the tech word or links
oh we need to put on buy me a coffee
link that that's important and we also
need like I think I need to have more
money inside of buy me a coffee to get
my money out I have to have at least $10
in De so if you guys want to buy me your
coffee um I'll put the link down in the
description below so um before we go
check out Mr who's the boss and his
dream Studio that cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars I'm not kidding
like those cameras cost um lots of stuff
of course we have SSA the classified SSA
ltw um the rise of Summer has created
interesting events um within the
narrative um because you know a lot of
things are happening I can say that
story about you know getting chased
behind the words is one maybe two
stories away anyway s news summer
briefing this is when um e Shay um
briefs uh the Press about what Sumer is
doing here and uh disappoint in gcam and
right now I am writing I'm not going to
show I am writing a story about um
Ethan and summer will first interact um
finally and he and K A K I think that's
how you would pronounce the name that I
made up for myself he and K are going to
create a business for themselves and
finally become profitable because you
know SSA did need to become profitable
back then and just just like the tech
reader needs to become profitable on now
so hopefully we can make I let's say
$200 in 2025 $200 um speaking of we
selling a phone for $200 uh I'm going to
have to update the listing anyway on the
road to
profitability that's a good episode
title um m is the boss who is certainly
more profitable than us for now um but
we will we we will come back we will
strike back um he did build build the
dream studio and I I always wonder like
you know of all this technology right we
have some of the most boring website
some of the most like useless useless
search and stuff like are we reaching a
plateau Plateau um I mean is
it I mean is it is it over because like
in the 2000s people really enthused like
early 2000 by technology and new comput
computation advancements and I'm
thinking well I mean what's next like
what are we're going to do next but you
know M's the boss he he is certainly
excited and he's showing how technology
can be still used at least in the
background um for more interesting
things and hopefully he become or stays
profitable because he invested quite a a
lot of money um in this studio
so hopefully you can see this on the
screen here we have M the boss who um
built his dream
Studio more of we've been filming with
one of these much smaller much less good
Sony A7 s the time has come to build the
future of the Mr who the boss Studio we
have one key goal with this something
that's going to allow us to make more
videos than we've ever made and also he
looks like a tech presento like not a
not a tech review but someone who's
going out there and presenting a new
product that they have released
hopefully he's going to be releasing new
video radio walkie-talkies not not those
Wi-Fi walkie talkies that we reviewed
they had like a range of 50 feet and
they had ad hoc Wi-Fi on them but video
um radio walkie-talkies at least a range
of 500 Fe come on come on guys you have
to at least match 2011 technology better
videos than we've ever made so we've
actually got two studios in this new
house we've got Studio A which is what
we're sitting in right now I want this
to be a really similar style of room to
what we used to film in you know camera
then desk and then a really cool
background just you know very much
upgraded from what we had and then I I
do need to upload those pictures those
GN pictures too as they L like as
pictures or something uh will be a
special page from the app that did save
uh design home 3D Studio B which is the
outbuilding that is where we can go
absolutely crazy and just and would it
be nice especially this is you know
concrete building so radio waves from
your phone to the tower back down to the
phone like if he wants to send a message
someone they might not get through so
wouldn't it be nice if he had you know
something type of case or even a
standalone piece of technology that
could I don't know show a live Fe the
video or walkie-talkie through the walls
and you could even see what was going on
through do I mean come on it has to be
at least something like this and I did
find one thing again you did have to
build it build the room of fantasies so
let's talk cameras previously we used to
use a really high-end Sony fx6 camera
for our main Studio but then anytime
that we film in any other room which
over time we have started to do a lot
more of we've been filming with one of
these much smaller much less good Sony
A7 S3 campas so I think the goal here
should be and this you know just kind of
remind me what he said to Mr Beast about
talking about how
people um expect tech review content to
be good and if my computer was good then
I have this in um 4K but you're not
getting 4K um so I expect the the tech
review content the cameras the quality
continue continually to film every
single video taken in this entire home
on an fx6 which means we are going to
have to get three of them one two
three $221,000 just on the camera
$21,000 which would take us at this
current rate um let's see um let's see
21 / by
3.69 it would take me 5,691 years to
make that add Revenue actually not years
months no not months I have to divide it
by two because that's what I made in six
months so let's divide that by two oh it
only take me 2,845 views and a half to
make that guys so um don't worry we'll
be here in 4,000 um
4,845 and I'll I'll be able to afford
those cameras Oh my God I mean I have
already somewhat come to terms with the
fact that we are investing a large part
of what we've earned so far to make our
videos better in the future but still
seeing figures like this in your basket
is it's not an everyday occurrence so
then the also interesting how in the UK
they called it the basket and here we
called it the cart also interesting how
he's able to animate I've always wanted
to know how he did this how we animated
his entire screen like you can still see
it as a Mac you have the buttons there
you have the weird looking browser but
it's animated it's not screen recording
anymore the microphone we've been using
for a really long time actually is the
Sennheiser it's already a really good
mic and it's actually such a good mic
that you probably have noticed the
difference in past videos anytime I move
from filming in the studio to filming
out and about where I'm having to wear
one of these little lav mics those sound
terrible compared to the main Sennheiser
one but the cool thing we can do here
because we're building this from the
ground up is a get an even better mic
and then B make sure that each of those
mics is pre-rigged up to each of those
Sony fx6 cameras that we're getting
which means that any video we film in
this house we can have Prime audio
quality okay so let's see if there's
anything better there's the MK 600 the
MK 418
mk30 what is up with these names part of
the oh speaking of names they all
finally changed they're names of the
computers oplex and X360 maybe it's HP
one of the companies change their names
to um pro pro and pro Max um so you know
sure your laptops will sound like
iPhones but you will have better
names of the reason that the microphone
Market is so convoluted is that
sometimes there isn't just a better and
a worse different microphones are
designed with different pickup patterns
so some will collect all the sound in a
one Eng others will be super narrow and
focused on exactly what's in front of
them and that's kind of what we want
because we want be able to hear me
really clearly and then nothing else
none of the Planes Trains cars that are
happening around me and this looks like
the absolute highest tiar implementation
of that let's do it oh my God we need to
get three okay this is where it gets fun
now we get to decide what actually goes
behind me when I'm filming videos you
know like right now we have two TV
screens and then one smaller screen in
the middle and we kind of put together
these cool little backdrops themed based
on the video we're filming how can we
take that to a whole other level we
could get like three massive TVs SP and
this was these were the TVs I was
talking about now this will be 98 in 98
in which is 2 Ines smaller than the
television that cohort uses in uh kids
Corners speaking of kids Corners kid
corner has an election and um Liz loses
76 to three which is
just sad couldn't happy me span the wall
but then you'd kind of lose out on some
ceiling height what's the biggest TV you
can buy so it seems like it's 98 in
34,000 I mean if this was our entire
4,000 they couldn't even make it 100
inches like it's two extra inches come
on people come on I mean who want who
wants to advertise 98 advertise 100
background then fine but even three of
those isn't going to come close to
covering this wall oh this is
interesting Let's ignore the price for
now so this is a digital signage panel
it's like a TV but it's more designed
for advertising and billboards I see oh
my God which makes sense and also you
probably have to get your own computer
to run it off of they're not going to
have any of that smart um computer
technology smart TV technology and there
kind of like you know cheap stuff well
at least maybe a few years ago cheap
stuff would be dumb and the kind of
mid-range consumer stuff wo would be
smart and then the really expensive
stuff would be like really oh my God
wait I'm just thinking to myself right
now imagine if we're filming videos and
the entire background behind me is
screen and we can just swap it out at
any moment for anything is there such
thing mean he's doing a pretty good job
just green screening it and editing it
like that I've always wondered you know
how how they get it to do like a video
backdrop for filming virtual production
so essentially massive screens designed
with exactly this in mind I mean this is
the kind of thing that like TV shows use
nowadays you know like the Mandalorian
that was filmed using a massive
wraparound immersive display there's one
here called Vu your creative technology
partner for Next Generation content oh
my goodness so they basically have a
massive library of virtual environments
that you wonder if you can make your own
votal environment like you take a
picture hey guys here's my cat upload it
and there's your own customize yourself
and they appear across your entire wall
we might be able to do something here
that no YouTuber has ever done before we
could I think YouTube done in all of
these places and because this is some of
those places look fake AI generated but
you know what would be nice to film
there all anyway this isn't like a green
screen where you use an editing program
afterwards to cut the person out this is
going to look real this is actually shot
using a virtual Production Studio the
transitions the transitions we can do I
don't think I've ever been as
immediately sold on something as I am
right now I mean that's that's really
really good especially if you know you
can get the keying right and everything
you know look great it actually look
better in there than what it actually
looks like in $91,000 already spent
$91,000 I see it oh sorry
$176,000 this is the obvious next step
in the mysteries of our studio oh yeah
this is also where we can fully optimize
all our other stuff like like you know
like tripods we spend so much time
fiddling with each individual leg of
tripod to make sure our camera is
completely before we shoot automated an
entire iPad just for a tele oh my God
wait this is everything I've been
looking for it actually just does it on
its own so we could just pre-program a
bunch of different heights that we tend
to use and never ever touch the legs
again it even works on uneven ground
that is so ridiculously impressive so
let's get three in terms of desks we
actually found some really good ones
when we were shopping for the office
video the only thing I'm thinking is you
know when we film I put a lot of heavy
objects on this table that could end up
scratching or breaking it oh they
actually have an even higher end one the
E7 Q Max mode is 300 kg I feel like this
is the way to go we'll get one of these
for this studio a I feel like Studio Be
is going to need something even more
extravagant oh also for that office we
bought the steel case gesture chairs
they're actually awesome I think we'll
just get the same room true oh yeah ligh
we us to have one light from this
company aperture and $192,000
he's gonna get these lights that kind of
you know do do stuff so let's let's fast
forward through and let's uh like do you
really want to see him buy stuff let
let's see him install it and um I think
the max the number
price so he's spending hundred of
thousands of dollars on the studio and
he'll probably make it from maybe one or
two
sponsorships individual CH this is too
cool Studio he's installing the
Everything Has Changed we created a
brand new floor that allowed us to hide
sockets everywhere we created a new
ceiling using this layer of tracking
that allowed us to mount acoustic fabric
on top to improve the sound we added air
conditioning in the middle of it and
lighting we spent I'm Li though you know
it is England so SP four months rigging
this room up with an industrial Quality
Lighting setup all finished off with
translucent Stone panels with you guess
it the Mr whoos logo B in the middle
started start with Studio away now this
used to be the gadge which is about the
worst room in the house you know maybe
may may maybe he should just stayed on
the floor and filmed like people still
liked his videos when he was on the
floor you could film him cuz right in
front of us we had this thin metal door
that lets every bit of outside noise in
and bounces every bit of inside noise
back at you so you get tons of echo so
we haven't actually removed it we've
just buried the thing with about 20 cm
of rock hoil which is incredibly good
for absorbing sound cuz it's really
fibrous there's a board on top of that
and then even more acoustic paneling on
top as as well as on every other inch of
the room the lighting is an even bigger
upgrade though because we've now got
about three times as much space compared
to the old setup to work with we've got
two massive dome lights instead of the
one that we used to have these are way
brighter than smaller lights but it's
not just about brightness the other
benefit of having larger light sources
like this is that they spread the light
so it looks softer on your face and I
actually look pretty for but it's all
relative we've got four light bars for
side lighting compared to the one that
we used to you might have not on some
old videos this very subtle outline
around me that is from the sidelight I
thought I thought was going to say at
this moment that his entire Studio was
green screen and those TVs didn't exist
but it's actually from a special type of
it's been really good for separating me
from the background so just as an
example if we turn all the room lights
off now so you see this light on my
cheeks and on the side of my face that's
because of these guys it creates so much
more shape there's a tiny little hairl
light up here this is like the cream on
the cake for lighting it just means that
you can see the entire outline of my
face and the top half doesn't disappear
into the background and then it's all
finished off with the dome lights which
are the cake itself and then this is
where we keep all of our spare tube
lights these are basically the easiest
quickest way to light up any room so
anytime that we're filming in a room
that's not a studio that already has all
the lights kind of baked into it we can
take two tubes from here we plop them so
I don't know why they have to do that in
the room we're filming in and we are
good to go and then the second we're
done we put them back in this case and
they are all automatically charging such
a good system the
[Music]
desk at so this desk is the flexis spot
e7q and this thing has been an absolute
godsend the main difference from my old
desk just being the fact that this is
Rock Solid and it does look very like
deep that is fake but it does I cannot
actually move the thing an inch which is
so great compared to the like rickety
this this is closer to being the 10
million Studio that cof Zilla has than
the one that cof Zilla pie cardboard
that we used to use to film our old
videos on plus the fact that we've
managed to go for a way bigger surface
than before means that we no longer have
to cram everything together when we're
testing a bunch of products we've got
the same steel case gesture whoa I I I
need like speed ramps around stop me
doing say wait wait about to go we got
the same Steelcase gesture chairs that
we have in the office but since room is
like the Mr who the boss Command Center
we got a custom Mr who the boss version
of it but let's not kid I wonder if you
could live stream like tons of cameras
and just look at them like a like a SP
right just before we get to Studio B
this is really the hero feature of
Studio A this is the Vu one which is a
combination of a massive screen specific
line for filming so it's very bright
very customizable and absorbs pretty
much all reflections with a powerful
computer sits in this rack here which
allows you to make the most of that
screen wonder what kind of operating
system a computer it's running let's
actually check it out let's check it out
Vu
one I wonder how much this thing cost
probably at least
$100,000 um so um we will not be testing
this out unless they have any Demos in
Houston this is the Vu one oh this is a
small one is it on wheals no maybe let's
see you have a Content Library you can
put on your iPad which is kind of a sad
use from iPad oh guys you can push a
button um they changed the iPad too but
okay um let's see what kind of operating
system the media server is
running 33 by 50 oh feet not inches feet
wow that's that's whoa he spent $249,000
on this because he doesn't have the mini
he has he has the real one that's crazy
$249,000 is
insane um then you have the Vu Studio
you better not you better not pay a
subscription for this that would be
that'd be
wrong is that saying what kind
of it's not saying what it what it uses
well we'll we'll check it out um later
we can go more in
depth so this is the new studio Studio
I'm of course kidding this is the new
studio it's actually our old Studio
that's actually so cool that we can
perfectly recreate that here and now I'm
outside well I mean the
TV which makes a change I'm in someone
else's house in a desert I can literally
be
anywhere that an
antelope and this right here is an
antelope in its natural habitat was that
bad I liked it okay as long she's happy
so at its base level this is the vew
Studio software it's a web page not an
app because they're changing things far
too often for it to be worth getting
approval from Apple every time they want
to do something so we scroll through the
list bad though I mean I am on Team web
page most of the time but
like
$249,000 and you couldn't even B make
probably tens of thousands of
backgrounds you pick one and that is
displayed all across this display here
and unlike filming in front of let's say
a green screen this is real this is
actually happening in the room that
we're filming in and that matters
because let's say we change the scene to
something with much more obvious pink
sunset lighting that light is actually
look smarter like I always say you do
look smarter when you just hold a tablet
like you hold down the tablet walk down
know I sometimes have my laptop the old
one and I walk down to school walk down
you know catch up to
denu and you know you'd always look
smart you're like what your bag was stol
let me pull on my laptop to me the desk
and everything on the desk which
wouldn't happen if the environment was
just edited in afterwards plus things
like the refle yeah look at that light
when you zoom in like on his face and on
his shirt like you can even see the
white hoodie is turnings on products or
objects that have any kind of
transparency though this might get
phased out by AI maybe not now but five
years in the future like you know like
we have R tracing on video games now
maybe we can have green screen R tracing
of course you know have green screen AI
I watched it Coan and compy video about
um how rotoscoping was getting adapted
to maybe 10 5 10 years in the
future they might sell as many units as
they can because they might still have
to start having to sell software these
are things that would previously killed
the green screen illusion but here they
just further immerse you in it it's kind
of like if you ever watch Star Wars the
Force awakens yes Star Wars movie don't
kill me even though the lightsabers in
that film obviously they weren't real
they filmed that movie the actors would
actually hold prop Sabers that still
emitted that light because seeing that
light bounce onto things is the best way
to make your effect convincing plus
something that you would very much
struggle to do with a green screen here
you can get a second camera and actually
get a real second angle of the same
scene and with every background there's
a whole load of settings things like
exposure things like color saturation
blur which is particularly handy because
let's say I want to make this background
seem like need an iPad for that though
like he did buy that it's it's $2,000
just to watch Netflix and some movies
when he has that huge TV things like
episode three in his bedroom like give a
phone further away from me than it
actually is like I mean they're building
any apps of phones nowadays like
everyone oh we need apps we need apps
they're building any apps phones
nowadays and at least use what you have
on you spend $2,000 for ta ridiculous
done I can scale up and down the
background I can rotate oh my goodness
that looks terrible welcome to the new
studio guys this is where it all comes
together together so this is pretty cool
right nice little fire in the back yeah
but I mean look at them you can even see
the Lin still like what it looks like
when we trying to send an image over but
it's not as convincing as it could be
for that reference that's when I heit
the sound and it
sent you can go check it out on the
website and for Love of All it's good
click on and add maybe I'll make four
four because if there was a fire that
big that close to me then you would
expect there to be not just a little bit
of flicker on the table over here but
the entire scene would be flickering
right so one and those are now orange so
they're bleeding that Fire's color onto
my sides another tap and the hairlight
will now match that same orange you but
even these massive domes each one can
display every single color so I can even
have it on my face and it's not even
just flat colors there are literally
programmable special effects with this
lighting for example this is a fire mode
and and I mean it's just concerningly
good really isn't it
beautiful some may say there's one more
thing one little sprinkle of magic so if
I click here this is V's Ai and the idea
is that you can use this AI to do
everything you could want to on this
screen let me upload the original
Windows XP War I wonder I wonder if we
could um you know just he like who's
this the year of the tech paper and then
let's just ask it to turn it into a
seamlessly Lo video so this isn't
something we're going to get right on
first go there's a lot to learn now he
looks like a some type of a what do I
call
him video
essayist commentary YouTube I like those
commentary YouTubers like Sunny V2 and
King of Nothing they need to be more
commentary YouTubers I do it but I don't
know I don't understand what's going on
my God like these random Tik tokers like
first I've ever heard of you is when I
watch this video about how you got
arrested I've never heard of you Dam my
life before but now he looks like one of
those nostalg more like a Nostalgia
Channel like hey guys today we're going
to be going back to 2001 when your
computer was plugged in directly to the
internet in any way could hack into it
speaking of hacking tutorials is so hard
to find now like you want to find a
Windows hacking tutoral oh good luck
good luck with that you're G to get a
whole bunch of antivirus and VPN
ads it's a pretty damn good start I'm so
excited and then the thing shooting all
of this content is one of the the fx6
cameras that we bought now you might be
wondering at this point why did we buy
three of them well one is here the
second is over here this is the rig that
we're planning on shooting just I wonder
what it's like to edit just about every
video around the house with and I won't
lie to you this is one of my proudest
achievements this one rig is everything
that you need to shoot a YouTube video
all stuck together into one well I mean
everything you need is right you but I
do wish I had a triod on Contraption so
it's this very high in cin camera which
we have made Wireless thanks to this
chunk of a battery on the back which
gives the whole system 3 and 1/2 hours
of runtime and notably charges with USBC
that's the best microphone that we could
find permanently connected to the rig
and always powered on by it and this is
a special kind of awesome because we've
pred decided what is the optimal
distance for me to stand from this
camera based on the lens that we're
using and this mic is set up so that it
will sound its best when I'm back I mean
if it wasn't for this
like than you I mean this this actually
looks legitimate like you could actually
believe if wasn't so perfect that he was
standing out there in the fields of
Colorado or something now the sunlight
here does look real but that mean at
first look this does look good standing
in that optimal position we've got
cushioned Wheels which means it's not
just easy to move around but you can ALS
those wheels cost you know those Apple
computer wheels cost like
$1,000 so film while moving it around to
get these beautiful sleeping style shots
and then the whole thing is carried by
this self-leveling tripod that we bought
which fixes pretty final remaining issue
of well messing around with tripod legs
if you've been there you'll know you
just set it to the height you want and
then it will correct its own angle and
it's not been wrong once and then the
third fx6 camera is sitting in Studio B
and it's finally time to go see it so
the reason that we even have two Studios
at all is that while Studio A is
insanely cool and it's going to make our
videos easier and better that studio is
specifically designed for presenting but
there are also of times when we're
filming when you want to plug something
into a computer test something on a TV
or just run around generally and
interact with products and be dumb and
that is the
essence of Studio B come on in so I mean
this studio it is nice looking did they
get the same TV though I mean if you
think about it you can you can put you
can draw monitor into Studio B or a and
you can get this look you can L get this
look take a picture upload it on to
Studio
one so I mean really why do you need
it like if you want that look you can
just take the picture and then put it on
to the fix
[Music]
screen so there are three things that
make this room particularly special to
film videos in one is the lighting so on
first glance you might look around this
room and think oh cool you went and
bought some Phillips Hue Lights
nuh don't get me wrong Philips H is
fantastic for adding some Ambience to
your living room but to actually create
a Next Generation professional studio
we've decided to go for something called
DMX lighting it has meant that the
lighting we've been able to put into
this room is the same lighting that you
see across like the biggest buildings in
the world exhibitions and concert
stadiums because the first problem it
solves is brightness hum
me side note Phillip how have we ended
up in a situation where we have more
cable than light strip anyway let's plug
you into there the point I wanted to
make is a Philips H light strip will
emit about 500 lumens of light per meter
a cheap light strip that you get on
Amazon probably closer to 300 the light
strips that we fitted you know I got
into this room emit
1,100 lumens and there are 180 of them
before we put these Stone panels on top
we had to make absolutely sure that the
lighting behind the stone was bright
enough that you could still see actually
I thought it I didn't watch this video
beforehand I I thought that was a screen
um on upon second watch which is just
the lights coming through the Rocks so
you know slim rocks but
also uh get even through it but also
even enough that you can't see the
individual LEDs when you're looking at
the panel this is really cool we
actually tested this using a
miniaturized version of this full wall
which even has the exact same kinds of
cutouts on the back to make these waved
shaped Parts brighter than the rest of
the wall and long story short we figured
out out that 180 strips allowed us to
have that Perfect final result there's
another benefit though with a typical
household lighting solution like Philips
hu you'll also reach a limit in terms of
the number of different lights you can
add suming between 30 to 50 and above
and problems will ensue but here every
single one of I thought was going to be
like oh and then you have to subscribe
for more but maybe it's the electrical
those 180 light strips and the 20 lamps
in the ceiling and the furniture all of
these things are based on the DMX
protocol which means each of them is
individually addressable every single
one can be its own different color but
also every single one can sync together
for room wide animations which is going
to make be really funny if someone
hacked his house and like turn off all
the lights from amazing backgrounds for
b-roll shots and we've hidden away
controllers and drivers which is the
stuff that takes in what we're asking
this thing to do and converts into the
result that are very highend so that the
lighting responds immediately to what
you do and animates in a way that is
more fluid and dynamic than I think I
have ever seen
before it's just surreal isn't it but
the biggest I wonder if he'll vent this
out like he could vent this out someone
could literally record a talk show
though maybe change that in the logo and
post or whatever like here we
are reason that a lot of Industry
chooses to use DMX is that you can do
absolutely anything with it the
interface is not as pretty as you but
let's say for one video we wanted to
make it look like it's blue and icy on
this side of the room and it's red and
fiery and there's a real flickering
flame racing towards that ice and eating
it up during the video we could do that
there's one more Finishing Touch we can
add to the lighting it's lepro our
sponsor and the crazy thing about these
things is that they have an AI lepro
maybe they paid for the entire video
like all of it just so we'd make it
insane lighting design assistant and you
just basically tell it what you want red
and
green some
reason and then look instantly every
single one of these lights will change
once to mimic those colors and if you
look at this you can even choose how
they display those colors but because
this is AI you don't have to be as rigid
with your commands so Christmas
party you know what's really funny how
we said red and green and then you said
Christmas party and it's back to red and
green and I guess white oh I wonder what
would happen if you said like United
States maybe we get some red R and blue
red R it's got the green it's got the
white it's got the yellow the red that
is exactly what I associate with
Christmas that's the single coolest
thing for me has to be the music syncing
so you can get music syncing on
basically all smart lights but they all
work in the same way they use their
microphone to basically just reflect the
intensity of the music whereas these use
lipo's light Beats technology to
simulate human hearing and actually make
them dance the way that you think they
should link in the description
how does that
work
like below now the second key pillar of
this room is sound we wanted it to feel
like you're walking into a bubble when
you come in here this separate world
where all we need to think about is
filming doesn't matter if the neighbors
are gardening doesn't matter if there
are planes flying over in our old place
we would have to stop filming probably
on average once every 20 minutes cuz of
something or another and I was very
aware when planning out this room that
this was our one chance to make sure
that doesn't happen again so we got
blackout blinds over here which is
useful both to give us full control over
lighting but also these things have an
extra layer of material inside of them
to cut the sound traveling through them
by about 50% the entire ceiling is
fitted with sound absorbing fabric we've
got fabric on the walls with actually
some pretty dense sound absorbing foam
directly behind that fabric and then
finally this long Runner rug which just
helps to take out a little bit of that
echo in the space and that leads me to
the final pillar of the room room the
gear itself and while we're on the
subject of audio we finally have a way
to test audio this right here is a very
high-end binaural microphone they
finally got one of those things that
allows you to put your like headphones
in you can test it without you know
having to sayell going designed to mimic
How Sound is picked up by the human ear
so you know all those times where I've
tested audio products in the past and I
can hear them perfectly cuz I'm with
them but it's been really hard for you
to appreciate them on your end well this
or should I say this is going to go a
long way towards fixing that I'm really
sorry if I freaked you out with that the
camera in this room is identical to the
second rig you saw which is perfect for
this space because this is the room
where we don't want any trailing wires
because all we want to do is grab the
camera wheel it into the position we
want and hit record and that is also why
I wanted to make absolute sure that the
central chair can also swivel because
just moving this camera around this room
following this chair that alone will
give us like 20 different filming angles
this lgtv is definitely the largest
highest picture quality TV that I have
ever owned and the
benefit I wonder if it's like the uh you
know the
TV uh that he tuned his phone into that
that his phone tuned into one biggest
smartphone to that is let's say we're
testing a new games console if there's
any imperfections then with a screen
like this we're going to be able to see
them so it makes this a really good
reference area specifically for testing
he won't be testing any new game
consoles until at least 2026 and
that's also I really appreciate how
instead of having a wire dangling out
the back of the TV the TV plugs into its
stand first which then plugs into the
mains which allows you to make every
cable disappear this is good product
design then we've got the desk setup so
any keyboards mice computer accessories
all of that kind of stuff we can test
here and and that's nice and let's see
we have</pre>
