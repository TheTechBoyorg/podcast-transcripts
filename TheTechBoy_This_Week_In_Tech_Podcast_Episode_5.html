<h1>TheTechBoy This Week In Tech Podcast Episode 5</h1>
<pre>we are going to be starting in three
two
one
hello and welcome to the tech boy this
week in tech podcast
[Music]
well that's a nice intro
as you can see the lights behind me are
flashing because they are the new or not
new but the lights we just received and
they're responding to the sound of my
voice because they were in music mode
right now i'm about to change these led
lights to blue
alright
and i hope you can see the led lights in
the
background they're the ones flashing
right now thank you to front for sending
me
the devices and full reviews should be
coming out shortly
okay so this might be a short episode so
let's get right into the podcast i'm
going to change the color of the led
lights to red and tell me if you can see
it
oh i can see it right there in the
background very nice pack alright
as you can see on our screen right now
we have done another tech redesign
um
that was because the of the layout
wouldn't allow us to
customize the site the way that we
wanted to so this layout is a default
not default but built-in block spot
uh
template so this should allow us to do
it
and i hope you like the studio redesign
with the new background and led lights
okay
so getting into what happened check boy
today this week
um
let's get into the first post
okay so we have the how to open portals
to other lands
with your just your phone
post
okay so this post
basically tells you how to
use google phone
to see what's underneath you and it will
you do that in
augmented reality or ar for short
it's using your
camera
your gps sensors and
oh
and yeah gps and camera
to
pull up the google earth image which on
the other side of the world
underneath you so in my backyard i was
underneath the indian ocean and was
finding things like australia
and
iron engineer australia that was very
interesting
all right and then we got into the our
life camera
that was a good review i hope you
enjoyed it let's see if i still have
okay
i can show you some our life accessories
right now this is the our life tripod
okay and for the people who are just
listening on mp3 it's just three legs
that kind of extend back and have a
twisty top
and then there's the hour life scooter
holder i was talking about
and the
our life lanyard
nice
and the our life usb flash drive um tell
me if you want to know more about this
flash drive it's not really a flash
drive it's just a sd card reader that
functions as a flash drive
okay
and what's coming up in the tech boy we
have vaughn lights i'm glad that we got
them
and
let's see
yay
it's responding to the sound of my voice
right now
and i'm using the control panel i really
like these lights
uh
the review is almost written it's very
good they are very good lights so let me
turn this back on to normal
there we go back to the blue here and if
you like this new camera quality
that is thanks to the
new led light bulb i moved from the top
to the front
and the
camera is a logitech which has the
same quality a little bit but it has
better audio quality so i hope you're
enjoying this all right and
right now live streaming isn't available
but that just means i can edit these
better but i probably won't
um
and our special guest couldn't come on
today but he might be able to come on
next week
okay
now on to uh very special announcement
indiegogo all right
this is the check boy and we are
starting an indiegogo camp game on
to get devices
if you want to see
a z fold uh
z flip
s 22 o to a
pixel 6a
motorola razer 2022
um
nothing phone
in any other devices
please contribute to this camp game
um
if you're able to get enough money
i will be able to test
more devices
and this will allow me to humanize tech
reviews anyone who contributes will
basically become part of an exclusive
community
who will get access to the tech boy
reviews a few days earlier or maybe a
day earlier and they can have their own
input onto a view this means that they
can
let's say i'm reviewing the a715g
okay
and
i write the review but i
don't mention what bands are 5g it has
and
someone who contributes gets access to
this special community and they say what
5g bands does this phone have and i'll
either send them a message or put it
into the review the best questions will
get that personalized touched and if you
contribute 12 or more there will be
exclusive giveaways from all the devices
that are coming in like default
and
z flip motorola laser 2022
if they release in the usn if you have
an interest in this device
so basically
if
there's a device that you want to see on
the tech boy contribute to this campaign
tell me and if i
can get the money and lots of people
want that device then i'll test it for
you and you'll have your own
personalized ish
humanized tech review that is very
exciting and i don't think it's ever
been done in the history of tech reviews
so
that is a very exciting development
okay
lots of big things are coming up in the
tech boy we just need to finish range
testing the
lativis
walkie-talkies okay
these have been some interesting
walkie-talkies we need to finish range
testing them
uh
we got to point one of mile but the
company wants us to re-range test it
so we'll do it and please tell me
if you want to see a test on this i
actually got this as a birthday present

indiegogo camp game and actually let's
watch the tech boy ad for the video

the galaxy notes

when i started the checkboard but it
seemed pretty big
but
i did it
it's written it just needs to get edited
and it will be out
and
let's talk about mc converter mc
converter that is a great file converter
okay
actually this podcast episode if you're
listening on mp3 right now
i take the video file
upload as mc converter and download it
that's how easy it is
but
