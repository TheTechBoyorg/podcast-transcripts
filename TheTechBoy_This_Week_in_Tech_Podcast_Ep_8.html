<h1>TheTechBoy This Week in Tech Podcast Ep 8</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
hi guys this is the tech boy from the
checkboy.org and welcome to this week in
the tech boy podcast okay so we reviewed
default lights we told you a new spy
trick that you can do with your phone
and I showed how we can block ads on
Chrome all right so let's get into it
all right so the first story of this
week is the blocking Edge on Chrome oh
wait no it's the last week never mind uh
okay so let's get to the front light
all right these are the lights that are
in the background right there these are
different lights uh there's a picture of
the room it's darkened in the room
editing uh I need to fix the tracker
um
it came in this box I obviously staged
it
um you can set these off offline and I
have some screen touch of the lights
so it's a very detailed review please go
read it
um I go into the lights the price but
here's a quick summary of two of you the
lights are good they have a good price
um they're very feature Rich but there's
some features that just
it could be better
like uh the light sometimes on display
colors as accurately as I would like all
right the next article of this week is
the hidden spy trick of your Android
phone okay so this this article talks
about the Spy trick in your Android
phone and I'm going to show you a short
video all right this one's better
as you see here I'm opening it in
picture and picture and on a pop-up View
and then I decrease the opacity of the
camera so you can barely see it and as
you can see you can see the Articles
through the camera lens like it's trans
slightly transparent and you see here
that you can get photo and video modes
and that is the me resizing it and
closing it really quickly just
demonstrating how you can use it as a
Sprite tool okay so the laptop from that
video was a Samsung Galaxy book Flex
flexbook Alpha 13.3 inches The Selective
I'm recording on right now
um not the webcam of course but this is
just a short video showing you how you
can use this feature
um this feature could be really useful
um if you're taking pictures stealth
delay and you want to look like you're
scrolling through your phone or
something like that
um it's so it's opacity it can be
lowered as you start in the video so
it's just a nice story article that you
can read
um please watch the video and also
please read the article all right
so those are the only two articles for
today I mean this week
um
I published that let's see
a couple days ago and this one was
published today all right and I need to
do our detector checkerboards
okay
as you see there's nothing here yet
um the contest ended the 10th so I'll
put stuff in these categories soon
okay now on to Indigo Girl
all right remember to contribute to our
campaign so you can get devices all
right so you only need about
twelve thousand four hundred eighty
eight more dollars I mean two thousand
four four hundred eighty eight more
dollars to reach our goal and we have 32
days left so come on
it's not that much money uh I mean it's
not much money come on we can do it
we can get to we could do that
all right and please tell me which
articles you like a lot
uh don't forget about our scam article
and we are selling some achievous or
um video walkie-talkies so
man the sound effects good
Anyway video walkie-talkies all right we
are selling these on eBay so here we go
it's only 35 dollars and seven dollars
for shipping
so
and they will come to you with the
original accessories and in the box so
please consider buying these video
walkie-talkies to support the tech boy
they're in good condition this was
missing mom but they both perfectly
worked the screens are good the
microphones are great the cameras are
good
and please read this article to review
and the uh sit down that we're done with
the font rights I'm glad to announce
that we have some other goodies coming
uh Bluetooth headphones not headphones
but a headset and uh yeah so like uh
headphone-ish but it's more for business
and
um some smart plugs that were supposed
to arrive today the tracking set arrived
today so I have to check to see if they
came in okay and this is some of our
popular articles we have the Samsung
Galaxy M8 for M7 and the Niagara
launcher Moleskine
the tech scam skip mail and I'm sorry we
can't sell your statistics today because
it seems like either the cookie blocker
has been blocked and got cooking this uh
tracker that tells us how many people
are here which is not good or we have
been breaking site records and because
of this
um
it it just didn't work
like that movie you have to pay to find
how many people coming so we weren't
going to do that okay and all right so
let's talk about the tech news this week
um so as you know Apple I'm very off the
newest devices and the review and
Broncos got lifted so the reviewers were
reviewing the devices at the iPhone 14
the iPhone 14 pro and the iPhone 14 pro
Max the uh
iPhone 14 Max or iPhone 14 plus yeah
that's what it's called wasn't that
reviewed as it has not been released yet
oh and of course the Apple watch Ultra
and yellow I've watched series was
probably reviewed too
um
music to be fine on there when you are
not getting one because
expensive and I'm an Android fan
but they're not that much in Tech this
week
um Google is requiring that people use
Fitbit as a Google account so for any
fitbits which is okay I mean hopefully
you don't get the Google account hacked
from your Fitbit
um before 2023
um
and that's basically all it's not that
much of a podcast episode today
um thank you for listening and Tech talk
to you later
