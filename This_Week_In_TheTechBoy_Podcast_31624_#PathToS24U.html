<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 31624 #PathToS24U</h1>
<pre>[Music]
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
this weekend the tech boy podcast I know
you guys are wondering about today's
podcast episode title called path to s24
you which stands for path to s24 Ultra
and you will find out what that is okay
so two
days okay on Wednesday okay um I went
Hands-On with the Galaxy s24 Ultra at a
T-Mobile store in the mall okay I didn't
really get to test that when have the
features but I did get a picture of me
holding it and I was like yes I'm going
to get this okay and I am determined to
get that phone okay and that this is how
we're going to be using tools to get
that phone right now so our first change
to our website
is no longer adree and unbiased but
still presenting the Christian message
we have enabled advertising to our site
as part of our path to s24
ultra uh
campaign
behold yeah which are probably being
blocked by my ad blocker right now let
me uh turn that off see
let's see uh oh there we go
behold it's not too many yet it's just
one D and
one uh wait I add Block it's probably
blocking it too let's
see oh there go undetectable
block
I'm going to whitelist my website and I
understand if you guys don't want okay
whatever I'll just turn this off there
go and
reload there we go Christian adnet has
placed Adge on our website it's just
only going to be right here
and right there and it's just like
Christian movies uh which looks like
Christian Hallmark or whatever and we
have made a grand total okay this is
gonna really hit you right there of two
cents at least as the last time I
checked um let me check um again got we
might have got hit to three we might
have hit
three uh also um everyone let's meet
what you go let us all meet your new
friend and
influencer Ava Harper oh yeah um
hopefully you can see this is my AI
influencer quote hi my name is AA har
which is an AI generated name I'm a
20-year-old digital influencer who lives
in Houston Texas DM me for details in
snap at theu which uh Snapchat I that
app is I I do not get it you cannot
upload images it seems has a weird chat
thingy I yeah forget it okay um just
forget it so all of you guys would
should follow this person because this
way this it's going to work we've
utilized AI tools
um we've Ed AI tools to create this
person and then I'm generate other
people or find other people um we can
actually go through here okay so we're
offering sponsor post by her and of
course on the tech boy Spong supped to
be more like her holding a can of water
or something like that
and
saying and then of course on the tech
booy we're offering sponsor post $100 so
the price is negotiable
um yes so
sponsored uh post or 100 USD okay um to
get sponsor post on our website we've
sent out emails to more including
Christian companies and
in tech companies and then non tech
companies that are Christian um probably
not going to like do spons post for them
like say if they make like Christian
t-shirts or something like that uh we're
not going to article about chrisan
t-shirts but we will say uh go go
through some articles and say maybe like
five so $20 an article and say okay this
tic sponsored by christian.net at the
bottom of the page or at the top of the
page for extra money okay so that's
another way that we're doing it we're
doing Spong post based by our AI
influencer so actually I'm going to go
in depth in talking about how we
generated this so this is our first
image yeah I generated her Leonardo
image and as you can see here it was
obviously screen screenshotted but then
we ran out of credit and then those
images started looking badly um I think
this the face MJ I actually like this
one a lot uh and I applied the B and W
filter to it this was generated using a
free program called
uh oh AI person you have to make sure
you type in AI person generator it's
using a free program called po change
generator it's is why it's kind of like
that that's also a filter um this is a
real person who then got face cloned on
it so we changed the faces and all the
images of course okay this is from
co-pilot and we changed the faces on it
from from our original face so that's
her original face over here and then we
just CL the face onto the person that
copil generated for us same thing there
same thing there notice it said supposed
to be an Android phone so it got the uh
like we camera BMP but it has the Apple
logo but backwards so the caption
generated was I'm the inverse Apple uh
yeah and then another one there just
just wearing a dress I don't remember oh
shoot you can tell it's a screenshot
that's my Edge screen right there okay
and then I clicked off and then that's
it 10 post seven followers and 10
following uh yeah so this try to get the
number up to 20 okay and then when she
hits like say 100 a thousand something
like that then people will come to us
and they will pay us money they will pay
us good money to um for to generate
images for us so boom AI model and
speaking of Instagram and AI model
models uh the tech booy did some
investigative research for women's
history M okay not really but you know
it's just kind of interesting at dispell
in this Mon and our investigative
research proved 15% of Instagram
comments on a girls post related to
appearance I proved it AI tools on a
mobile device all of this information
was uh garnered from a uh from my phone
okay and believe me it is increasingly
boring to school Instagram copy paste of
pictures of 100 people F them into an
Excel spreadsheet and copy them in so
that all the comments downloaded it was
over 3,000 comments 3,000 comments on
over 100 100 people uh which is kind of
weird uh large uh that's like 30
comments per person though I did do some
high people so like bre Cooper probably
got and then I just got some like random
people that I know with
like no amount of follows comparativ so
that made sure it was like Fair like and
then I just picked like random people
you can read through how we did the data
here and but then I used this tool this
AI tool called Julius AI chat that was
able to analyze the data and it told me
about 14 something per of it were
comments relating to appearance but then
I realized that some of the comments
were in Arabic yeah so we went
multinational I tried to mix it all the
comments like most of them were in
English but then I had it translated and
it worked out to about 15.6 so over 15%
of comments on a girl's Instagram are
all about appearance I thought is
actually going to be higher my guess is
97% for a headline uh but yeah it's
pretty high I mean that's 15% so that
means like if you get 100 comments 15 of
them will be related to
appearance BR interesting uh data there
do with that what you will I'm not going
to make a big deal about it uh I was
thinking about doing it for boys but
doesn't seem like to use the platform
that much but tell me if you want need
to do it then I did my text review of
GEOS by AI which you have talked about
on the show a lot so uh go back listen
to up search or read this article if you
want to know about CH by AI just know
that uh it's a really great tool for
oent you search an image it'll give you
the location unfortunately and the bad
news for oent search. Rox head is gone
down if you guys don't know what that is
it's the site that allows you to like SE
license flate numbers IP addresses phone
numbers Etc um fourth we using like two
terabytes of dat oh my goodness let's
see what we have here C of data thank
you my loyal
visitors we have generated with the two
ads on our website and then like one
that's underneath the post with have 33
Impressions three
cents so um path to s22
ultra Let's see we can't even pay the
tax yet but I mean that's that's kind of
high uh we can't even pay the tax yet so
we got to hit
$1,200 by the end of this month okay we
got 15 days to do it I believe and us I
believe we got three cents from ads okay
aa's going to generate some money too
and then of course our spons post all we
need is 12 sponsor posts for $100 that's
all we need 12 spons posts all we can
just do Rec coing spons segment so like

uh well you might get good Christian
movies out of this so there's that as
well speaking of Christianity and
Christianity in general
uh we got to talk about the new well not
new but the episodes that came out today
on Keys kid stream which has an updated
website uh Keys kids radio which you
guys know I was interviewed
on
um
they I have a new designed website but
whatever okay so we were listening to
the radio today and it is this episode
from down Gill L now guys remember from
last week when we were talking about how
DGL down G Lane uh basically was like a
waste of an episode like imagine waking
up in 2002 um and they don't have it on
streaming and you hear this episode but
right before you guys to get the big
piece of
information Brook conscience well early
in today's episode uh Brooke is writing
in her journal saying I'm glad my
conscience gotten away but I kind of
wish it didn't I wish we H was about to
be big and it kind of feels like the
episode's about to Kil trip you into
feeling bad about like wanting to do it
cuz like in like as The Listener you are
Brook you're sing Everything through
Brook's eyes you're wanting to hear what
the parents are trying to say so it's
kind of like oh yes I I I feel guilty
for spying on the [ __ ] parents hello
Kate
develin I feel guilty for spying on the
moan parents it's like you didn't
Inspire them you just listening to them
on the radio and then you like he will
do a punishment it's like yeah whatever
and then there's this other episode from
Kids Corner great Audio Drama even like
third graders I I could say uh which was
saying
the
um oh yes this this this person in here
who is an undercover secret agent really
good episode you to go check it out it's
called Blue PR or something like that
all right Kate what would you like to
talk about today um on today's podcast I
just finished talking about our new
AI digital influencer in fact I I guess
I should sh on X
okay our new AI digital
influencer um we can talk about how we
made her if you want oh you can't even
see her there we go
AVU which it's just an AI name it kind
of sounds like two first names whatever
um maybe I should make more who what do
you think guys um we can talk about how
we make these we can talk about what is
new on YouTube and my computer's been
running really slow but whatever um o we
should talk about
the these two new well neish AI products
that we've talked about the rabbit R1
which is I mean that's kind of like a
piece of
junk uh I mean I kind of like it but I
mean conceptually it's kind of scam like
everything that it does you can put into
an app or whatever it's a $200 app and
then the phone
thing
that uh not that's not a phone it
projects what's it called Humane AI pin
which basically has its own cell phone
plan price to go with the
subscription uh let's find out what
they're
hiding there are two of these AI
assistant devices that are shipping
really soon there's the rabbit R1 so I
kind of like this one look you got a
camera here an actual screen which is
good you know screens are good on
devices okay unless you're setting them
kids and working them as screenless but
then screen are still good and then you
got a scroll wheel so you know you got a
mix of tech from 2006 blackberries and
2019 iPhones and then there's the Humane
AI pin and both okay you got a camera
here you got a holographic projector
like it's from a movie which is fine but
the holographic projector is not that
good and also has a subscription prices
like it's 2007 yeah like now but like
it's for what it is it's very expensive
like there's no full screen oros both of
these companies have made some very
impressive but questionable claims as to
what these products are capable of
examples of you know these devices where
you can just talk to them have two or
three voice commands and it's booking an
entire trip for your family to Europe
it's wild and they also have examples
where they're like you know showing kind
of useful but I'm wondering if it's
using uh data from Partners um that it
oh what's it say why does the ladies
website for my disability trans Transit
work in Chrome but not brave vice versa
Facebook what's your website what's the
website uh it's probably uh because
Brave is like a privacy browser so it
could be blacking cookies in your
browser not sure why why Facebook
wouldn't work in Chrome though um Chrome
is more of like a normal browser so most
most websites are coded to work with
chrome and it's G to work with most
devices so if you to load them in Brave
which is based on the chromium engine
which is open source project it probably
will work like most websites will work
but Brave browsers built up on privacy
so it blocks cookies so your disability
website may need those cookies to
function make sure that you're like
logged in uh
correct the device uh a handful of
almonds and it's able able to calculate
calories or the amount of protein that's
in it and you don't need your phone
there's no well I mean yes but that's
not half a cup of or half a cup would be
more like maybe two
handfuls launching of apps the idea is
that these devices will make your life
easier like you can use AI to assist you
with some repairs uh you can do o that
looks
terrible it should go 6040 and get rid
of these icons to so you can actually
read more of the not like you're trying
to read a text like live translation
they allude to the idea that you could
replace your phone with one of the
hopefully live translation Works without
you're having to enable it these devices
down the line now as we get closer to
these ship dates I couldn't help but
just look more into these companies like
why is it that these things are weeks
away from shipping and no one has
handled one of these things yet right
it's kind of weird so I went in and
having done a little bit of research I
feel like we might be getting fleeced
okay I'm going to start off with the
rabbit R1 so this is the more popular of
I'm not sure if the rabbit R1 I mean
didn't teenage engineering make a fake
phone let me
see I'm pretty sure that might come I'm
not so sure about the Humane AI pin uh
but teenage engineering actually mix
projects no they never made a fake phone
okay the two this thing is a $200 device
cute looking Hardware it's got some
teenage engineering design language
going on has a small screen a camera a
analog scroll wheel a speaker a button
it's got very simple harder and at the
time of shooting this video they've
supposedly sold over 100,000 units on
pre-order this thing is popped off and
then the other device the I wonder if
it's the next flip of zero like it's a
nice handheld Gadget know fun to play
with has this tiny screen maybe has it's
open to developers Humane AI pin this is
by contrast a
$700 device and it also needs a $25
monthly subscription but this is also an
a assistant but instead of a screen this
uses a projector that projects the image
of the UI onto your hand it's a you know
full while that guy is using an iPhone
15 Pro Max when he's not demonstrating
his like terrible screen NE party trick
maybe a little gimmicky but this device
is not handheld it's a pin that can
attach to your clothing now they hav
that would be great if you worked in the
security industry and you're we got
break people breaking in over here
revealed sales figures or anything but
it seems just by looking online that
this product hasn't had as successful as
a launch as a rabbit R1 H I wonder why I
I I really wonder why probably because
of its $700 price tag with its monthly
subscription now the the first question
you might have having seen these two
things is what do they even do and
that's a really important question right
but every single time I've seen these
companies answer that question they they
skirt around it they they talk about
these like AI buzzword they talk about
you know Contex that's like all the AI
companies these days
well Computing I I think the reason why
they don't like answering this question
is because it's an uncomfortable answer
the answer I think of what do these
things even do is that right now these
products they basically do what your
phone does but they're just not as good
at doing it your phone's better at it
that means you can use it however you
want what what tell me something you
would use that for so you use it for
just about anything like uh sending
texts or checking up on any
notifications that you've got in Stu why
is the technology on this in this
Newsroom why do
these why do they have one two three
four five six seven eight nine eight or
nine laptops for three people who are on
the show and they all outdated that you
do just all the time how would I know
without seeing a screen that somebody
was texting me and I'm your phone is
more versatile it's more powerful it's
more private because these AI assistant
devices lean on voice interaction to be
able to do what they do you can't really
watch videos on these things or
play why would you watch a video oh we
got a third visitor hello games on them
and because you still have to carry your
phone around with you you now have two
devices you have to manage but these AI
assistent devices are rooted in AI like
they're built from the ground up with
operating systems that are entirely
based on AI and because of that you have
the ability to be to talk to these
devices with voice commands and they can
carry out a task when is the next
eclipse where is the best place to see
it the next total solar eclipse will
occur on April 8th 2024 I mean you could
just do have with Google assistant or
Bixby or Gemini one of the best places
to see it is we got a question we got a
question I got a Galaxy a3s last week my
Galaxy a uh 13 I guess was lost oh no um
did you try to use Google find my
device or your Samsung account to trace
Ito it can give you answers it can
perform a sequence of tasks that would
normally take like five to maybe even 10
clicks on a phone so there is Val
wouldn't take that many clicks I don't
Val to that right you can you can
download jet GPT on a phone it's really
good talk to something with your natural
language and this device will just do
stuff however the followup question is
okay if that's what this thing can do
why is it not an app like why is this a
piece of Hardware that you have to buy
why isn't it just something you can
download from the app store or the Play
Store because they wouldn't get that
much money let's say that they pric it
at $3.99 a month okay $4 but
$48 per user and then that's it that's
all they get but if they price it too
high say 15 a month and maybe they'll
get about 180 per user but they won't
get that many
users and for $48 month plan uh it
wouldn't be that
much no because I looked it where and
was probably taken well you can trace
your phone using Google uh using a
Google account or your Samsung account
and also make sure and I'm pretty sure
carer has this information to report
that IIA uh number as stallen the IMI
number it's like a 15-digit number on
the back of the phone you just have to
log in to T-Mobile at mmobile whatever
you use and they'll tell you which IMEI
number was and you can Market as
stolen uh with the carrier and with the
police so if the guy Tes to sell it uh
he won't be able to do it uh legally
anymore
um and you can always like run a check
online and also if you like Mar with a
police report then they can potentially
go back and get it or if not you can use
those same tools Google find my device a
Samsung find my device to reset your
phone okay this is a very important
question and every time they've been
asked this question these companies
again they Dodge it I feel like they're
just they won't just admit the the
simple reason as to why it's a piece of
Hardware well there's a few reasons
number one in order for an app to exist
that has the type of capabilities that
we're talking about here this app would
need elevated access to the operating
system like you would need access to
like passwords credit card info that
makes sense that makes sense though I
mean you could obviously save that on
stove for somewhere not saying that's a
good idea I'm saying like if you want it
to to make it
easier on
yourself
it would need access to like the
microphone the camera the GPS like all
of that stuff off of a single tap of a
button and those things are locked out
from developers rightfully so right
Apple and Google there's no way they're
giving developers that type of access on
one click certainly not right now but
the other reason is that even if in the
future if apple and or Google decide hey
you know we're going to allow app
developers to have access to this off a
single click Apple and Google are
actively working on their own versions
of these things and when they do come
out like it'll have awesome Hardware
integration and integration with
partners and stuff their in-house app
would absolutely destroy any kind of
third party app so makes sense and I
almost forgot to talk about this but
Asus launched a new phone and it's big
but it does have ai functionality built
into it and I mean maybe we might have
to reame this thing path to the s20 uh
to to the Asus of 11 phone Ultra cuz it
it looks pretty good good now design
Wise It's e statically awful okay it is
it is it is an atrocity of a design okay
but I mean it's a phone okay whatever um
I'm I'm gonna buy it and use it well not
right now I'm saying like if I was gonna
buy I was gonna use it right okay it is
a phone and it's a good phone apparently
and it has AI built into it so I'm going
to do a comparison right now oh not
right now but after this video ends
which is in it's kind of long right you
don't want to touch apps but the third
reason and the main reason is for
attention because if this was an app no
one would care I wouldn't have been
having this conversation with you if
they had an app that did exactly what
the rabbit I mean apps apps can go big
like Strat PT co-pilot and a Super Bowl
commercial uh
chbt uh you know when they launched the
app it was it was news but I understand
what this is besides you can't really
show that off all right I think that's
all we're going to talk about for right
now um intain to this video I downloaded
the
olama AI app and it has an uncensored
version so that's great so all you have
to do is um go to download it from the
website AMA download the windows version
and then type in search for your model
on the oama website so I'm gonna show it
to
you it's O and llama.com so o ma.com you
search for your
model
and you search for uncensored and then
you'll say
install what you do is when you install
AMA you'll go to your terminal and type
that in boom you get an uned AI model
now it is kind of slow right and it's
CLI only and you can't delete stuff I'll
show you okay so
terminal
uh maybe it's
Sam oh yes you'll copy that command and
oh you can't see it okay you'll copy
this command um to run it and to install
it you do the
command
install I think it's it's on here
somewhere um and then you go to your
terminal paste that
in and it's going to generate and you'll
get uncensured AI that's kind of me on
features so there we go right there
uncensured AI
model okay I'm going to ask it like I
asked the regular version how to trace
the St and it wouldn't tell me it kind
of tell me let's see how to tr a phone
with ss7 ss7 is a vulnerability and
network that allows you to trace and
stuff all right and while it's
generating it takes a long time and
these models are big like three four
gigabytes um large so makes you have
enough storage um here it wouldn't even
install until I had to free up some
space on my computer and this is a 500
computer almost okay let's see what else
we have out there in the tech World
um oh yes what were we talking about the
Asus phone so uh they're kind of they're
kind of getting bigger now like a lot
bigger I think it's a 6.8 inches so
that's a full inch larger than the other
phone Zen phone 10 but they're still
selling it as small and mighty so I'm
thinking they might
they might uh leave this as the Mini
version of it because it's still pretty
good phone here we go the Zin phone 11
Ultra they might do like small phone big
phone small phone big phone small phone
big phone which be kind of smart
honestly because you'll get good specs
in each of them and you won't run out of
money all right so this big phone is
$899.99 so this puts it in line with
about the
s24 plus okay but this is their Flagship
so people would compare it to the s24
for but first of all that design looks
terrible it's absolutely
horrendous okay their uh flip up camera
design was better I don't know who
approved this design but it's awful but
it doesn't really matter because like
who looks at the back the phone other
than the other person who used to work
here what's his name myo yes him okay
um I mean these colors I mean at least
they have black that's good black I blue
black white or silver and then orange
call orang or whatever and here's the
screen of the phone you know fairly
typical kind of looks like a pixeled up
front just get this out of my face like
really no okay there you go uh power
button and volume markers on this side
um fun fact I bought a drone and
the the uh phone hold is not on the top
like most of it's on the bottom which is
kind of weird but it's curved at the
bottom so it doesn't touch the power
buttons but since my buttons on this
side and their stupid app only rotates
to go up this site I have to flip it
like this so I don't activate the button
of course and then I have to download
another app to flip my uh landscape mode
from the everything pointing the wrong
way so it's kind of annoying like that
well anyway that's a weird tangent okay
um design which fire designers
please okay uh but anyway we got the
monogram embodying Aus DNA ifus DNA is
uh really boring and bl I guess that's
it it does have headphone jack Jack
which is good is that two USBC ports I
mean forget the design two USBC ports
that's amazing is that
three three USBC ports it's
crazy I got have to look at the specs on
that but that that could be a game
changer I could have like two audio
streams no actually three audio streams
and charged the phone I could charge
other people's phones while charging my
phone I
could I could put like I mean I even mix
up the lack of expandable St put in your
little SD card reader and dongle in
there put in your charger right there
and you could even put like a power bank
in there that's amazing if that's
actually true maybe that's a mistake all
right Pro level camera Flagship level
camera cutting Ed AI algorithm capturing
moments effortlessly now we've been
talking about AI C for 28 since 2018 so
whatever okay uh but and then
lond any other comments no
okay so it is water resistant I hope
okay um a new design which means it's
one bigger than the last
phone uh new design oh okay that's
it A is for AE are they trying to pull
push this phone off like it's like a
nothing phone because it's not pulling
that off nope that's is not Aesthetics
okay aesthetic B glossy and matte
finishes combined reflecting
Elegance the Chinese symbol of people
what who writs these things people oh is
that what the a thing is for you're
calling this your design anant that is
literally a piece of metal boom okay uh
colors from the Earth's canvas uh sure I
guess you know blue like the sky what'
you get black though it's not that much
black in the's canvas it's calling
nighttime black whatever okay uh Eternal
Black the Deep polar Knights of
Iceland it's nowhere near China Missy
gray San
Francisco that's gray I thought it was
yellow but what or silver okay so the
uh this phone represents San Francisco's
fog yeah their designers uh had way too
much time on their hand or no time and
they just made stuff up desert sand
representing of course this the famous
sand dunes of Japan could have that
Egypt or Lally any uh country in Africa
no no no no no no Japan okay and blue
where's it getting blue from
Sweden so you got the Chinese alphabets
on the back of your phone and depending
on the color you get your phone is
either
Swedish I uh
Icelandic
American or
Japanese okay um O's conscious design
that step is particular cracked from
100% recycled aluminum which um I I
could care less I don't care where your
aluminum came
from okay uh if you could get me that
phone 22% off without using my cyle
aluminum I'd be happy or without using
my cyle good ass okay uh eco friendly
packaging again I don't buy the phone to
look at the Box you could s it to me in
a plastic bag as long as I get a charger
in the Box uh let's see flat paper wraps
with phone and cable yeah paper used be
bad it's good whatever okay
um here we go three linges which is a
staple on literally every phone okay
here we go 50 megapixel main camera only
MX uh 890 okay okay 6X is hybrid gimbal
stabilizer so hope that means
it's both like regular
and optically stabilized okay and two
times L of Zoom which means taking
pixels at 20 megapixels I guess bending
them down there uh 32 megapixel
telephoto which I'm glad to see that
increase but only three times whatever
it's pretty good though and then a 13
megapix Ultra wide camera which is kind
of weird because like 13 megapixels is
like a weird number it's like 14
whatever okay one megapixel height and
12 uh depends on how big the L size is
though that's probably the main that's
probably Al right so it's probably not
going to that much light perfect for
portrait portrait video use AI ALG
natural dep Field Effect identifies
local points in real time that's good
and recognize faces even your
pets
okay that's good no more shakes okay the
gamble stabilization was really good on
the tin so I expect it to go to the
ultra uh 11
Ultra the software looks a bit like
maybe they could stop trying to design
the back of the phone and um link it to
Iceland Sweden uh United States and
Japan and Chinese characters and
actually designed their software just a
just a thought okay zoom's already in 30
times so okay I compare it to the s24
zoom Vis the Brilliance it recognizes
objects yes recognizes objects just like
the uh what was that phone the A90 from
2018 uh something like that a80 some
mid-range Samsung phone with four
cameras and all of them sucks okay um AI
object s
so okay it looks like it has a wideangle
selfie camera so that's good it can
expand its field of vision for 90
degrees pi over two for p day L out
there okay uh 32 megapixel red green
black white okay great I'm glad to take
color
pixels okay let's see semantic show
can search for event Time locations and
photos it's pretty good I'm wondering
though if it's using them from exif data
on the or need AI noise
cancellation it's good it's good um I
have to test and see if it works but
that is a good feature Ai call
translator it translates your phone so
no longer Samsung exclusive looks like
it's really using that uh qualm Snap
Dragon
transcript has been able to do that for
a long time but I'm glad it's on device
and local in real time and AI wallpaper
that's good so kind of light on the AI
features compared to the s24 series uh
no word on if Circle search is on here
okay that's whatever but it does have
the AI chip 30% faster and 25% faster
than previous ging phone which is pretty
good upgrade I have to do some video
editing on here I get up to 12 gabt of
RAM and up to 256 gigabyt of
storage it's not good but for the price
eh it's fine okay um smooth Dynamic
non-stop one to 120 Hoots display good
uh that's a staple for me now I actually
like my 120 H display I was using an
iPhone was like why is it so slow but
whatever um okay
um display 94% screen to body ratio
which okay that's great if it has three
USBC fors please tell me that's an
important feature okay uh even in the
sun 2,500 nits great don't know how big
the battery is is though so I'm not sure
about that uh is this using ausus own
gallery of Google
pixel Google photos Val 5,500 milliamp
hour yes 65 watt hypercharge yes
so first impressions look great on this
thing and compared to the say s24 Al s24
better AI features this may have a
better battery better screen no I'm not
sure about color accuracy and all that
it's bigger and brighter screen I think
just slightly but it depends on how
bright you are going outside may have
more ports has a headphone jack um but
Samsung does have Samsung exclusive
features will get longer software
updates it does have wi is charging so
that's great faster charging on this one
though I'd have to do a speed test to
see which one is really faster like
because I know they slow down but at
least is equal to 50 just smoke the 24
plus okay
uh the 24 plus of course does have deck
this has phone link which is nothing
like Dex and qualcom seamless technology
which is qualcomm's version of this
Glide X here you go share photos and
videos to devices share turn your phone
into webcam that's a good feature but I
mean this
is like that's not really that's not
really productivity on another device
fil link that's the same thing and
qualum SE this
technology uh see if your phone has a
Snapdragon chip you have a Snapdragon
computer and they'll sync with each
other which is kind of like that's like
one person a one person with an Android
phone and a Windows on ARM
device but whatever okay got g victus 2
so that's good ip68 this is
great
um that's it okay let's go to the tech
spec because I saw I saw three ports
they need to tell me if it has three
phone charging ports let's see
here okay it's running Android 14
Snapdragon agent uh three so it got the
best chips best memory decent storage
6.78 uh inches so 08 inches no not 08
inches 08 inches bigger than the Samsung
okay it's using a Samsung display so
it's probably as good as the other one
144 HZ for gaming only which can
you decide if something's a game like G
like Samsung game mode you can import
any application you want so if I just
put something in it go up to 144 HS HDR
supported that's
good supports glove touch okay I'm s say
Samsung's cameras would probably be
better but I mean the cameras look
decent
um I like the test Samsung's Main and
the ultra wide against the ultra
wide 8K video okay okay um no 120 frames
per second video recording which is
unfortunate has a time lapse time slow
motion photo take still photo while
recording video only works in all modes
except for 8K okay um supports 2.45 gz
and six gz Wi-Fi supports Bluetooth
Wi-Fi Direct NFC and maybe Wi-Fi 7
depending on where you live okay dual
SIM capability it's great and works with
the 5G Network okay and then got in
display you do face recenter Compass
General scope proximity okay the main
sens is 5,500 Milli battery that is a
great feature um wired and wireless
charging no charger in the Box still not
telling me how many points it has but so
I'm going to say that's a uh that was a
glitch that was a mess up by
Asus okay it's great let's see how many
followers AA has now you guys should
follow you guys should follow him right
it's gonna bring us
money seven okay whatever
um okay I'm gonna I'm gonna go ask pman
if they would
like President
Biden
[Music]
okay great let's see what they say all
right
um
having a live at the AR cter that's nice
okay let's see what other phones they
have here lord of the Wings which is
Christian I think I'm not sure uh I know
that talk about it like we're working
yes yes we're working uh didn't compare
Jesus to it or something like that it's
popular amongst the the the the people
who write water
very popular to to really talk about the
world and Lord of the Rings and don't be
depressed or something like that but
whatever this phone has
it what I thought we were talking about
a phone oh okay
whatever oh okay there we go there
F oh cover ring on the most watches
that's the ability of actually changing
the ring or the actual cover ring on the
actual watch to change lock screen
options changing straps so the
customization pretty useful levels that
we get in here are definitely very
unique also to top that off I mean it's
a great way for sh me to make money it
actually has the ability of going all
the way up to 15 days with basically a
single charge which is very very two
weeks wow okay it makes us give us the
ability of actually customizing it I can
change the ring here or the bezel on the
actually lock in the space there's no
chance for it to fall off uh this is the
original band that comes with it again
you can buy your own uh the actual
bezels themselves are stainless steel
and of course it's covered with corn and
Goa glass so this is the frame I
mentioned you guys that's the little
Offset you put it on once you have it on
correctly put on you lock it in there's
a little bit of a click and it actually
sits on very nicely the bands very
straight these are going to be one
obviously saying designed by sh speaking
of smart watches I like how this one
Circle um news is coming out that
Samsung's going to go back to square
watch I really hope they don't because
unless add a camera to it I me add a
camera to watch I'd be happy um
hopefully they don't go back to SC
watches because then people going think
you have an Apple Watch you know want
people think that would you imagine
people think you have an
iPhone I think it says that on the other
side so right there so designed by
xiaomi sitting in there the sensors on
the bottom the charging pins and of
course everything on the bottom is
pretty straightforward and I hopefully
you can guys see that there's basically
the speaker sitting in there as well as
the microphone so we have the ability of
picking up phone calls from this as well
uh the actual complications are as far
as widges are pretty much standard
swiping from the left takes you to
basically media player events and alarm
one more to accessing Alexa that's one
of the nice ones now you'll notice that
it's responding to me back in French and
I'll explain to you that once we get
into the application but uh okay let's
go the battery life the the battery that
we have here is a 486 milliamp if pretty
much cell phone battery of from years
ago you decide to keep the always on
display off which is what I've had
myself and I've been using it basically
with the raise to aake which works
absolutely fantastic uh but again if
you're using it with an iOS device it's
going to be about 14 and a half days
with mixed usage if you're using it with
an Android device it's going to get you
up to 15 days interesting does Android
app use less battery keep in mind that
Android needs to be Android 8.0 and of
course iOS 12 and higher as far as
managing this and of course pairing it
to your smartphone you just need to
download the Mi fitness app and it's
pretty much a straightforward experience
you connect it you connect it directly
into the actual device and you're able
to customize different options from app
notific ation incoming calls background
permissions alarms sync events calendars
weather information you can also
customize the weather between Celsius
and Fahrenheit world clock if you want
to add additional W heart additional
ones of course heart rate sleep uh blood
oxygen level of course stress standing
reminder stats normal watch features
using it with an s24 ultra which makes
it very nice and that means I'm actually
able to jump in from one device to the
other and I'm still able to get all my
information exactly as it's supposed to
the one thing I did want to share you
guys real quick when we go down here to
Alexa if this is using when you set up
your Mi account here and you set it to
be in the US Alexa unfortunately is not
available in that market if you set it
up into the European markets let's say
UK or Paris it actually runs very nicely
so for me I I Happ to UK speaking I did
switch my account directly to show it
being in Paris and that's the reason why
whenever I'm interacting with Alexa
although it listens to me in English it
responds back to me in French but I
understand French so that works nicely
there was one update that I did apply
directly into the account you can
obviously change the different
information in here uh you can also go
in they're customized the way your
notifications kind of come through uh
seems like a pretty nice watch uh all
things
considered a pro jacku
phone my Capital One team made it easy
to redeem your credit card rewards in
stores like REI we built an API that is
serous scalable and reusable really want
to test the waters well the whole King
thing is still in Alpha that's
technology at Capital One do you really
have to sacrifice safety to have such a
Lush Lawn well no with Sunday you so I
might be biting off a little bit more
than I it's huge and even they have a
better design than Theus sometimes you
just got to play with something
outlandish you could Thro at it someone
Folks at Uni Herz sent over the new
88849 tank do you know how many times
have emailed these people to send me
something three Pro for me to take on a
test drive and share some thoughts and I
have a lot of thoughts just gonna get
some a huge power brick for a phone
stuff out of the box here for this video
so I love rug look at the fingerprints
on that thing good phones and computers
o has an IR blaster right there nice
night vision I really wish we sold more
industrial protected gadgets directly to
Consumers I'm also formerly an eagle
scout and that motto be prepared sticks
with you as you get older the tank 3 Pro
kind of tests some of my previous
comments on rugged gadgets this thing
really is a Swiss army knife
Communications device like it's not
really a phone in any modern pratice I
wish they had the walkie-talkie
functionality on it that would be nice
sense first this thing is massive whoa
it's like an inch I know we make jokes
about other devices like oh it's a beast
of a phone it's a Kaiju of a phone but
now that we've overused those other
adjectives none of them can really
Express how big the tank is compared to
normal pocketable computers I guess this
is what it takes to include nearly every
conceivable technology is that usba a
we've ever put into a phone in the past
into one shell I don't know I'll throw
some specs over good to see to see 6179
in so just a little bit bigger than
Theus uh 1080p kind of whatever
HZ dimensity
820 80 sorry 18 gigabytes of RAM that
that is inflated that is obviously
inflated in the accounting some of the
storage with whatever 52 G of storage
that's nice headphone jack and micro
thing okay uh 23 800 Milli hours so it's
just going to last a really long time 10
wild RSE cable charging infrared night
vision camping lb police lights DP
projector uh active cooling INF red
Blaster man it's not missing anything I
mean the only thing that's missing is
like literally usba and the Linux
distribution run c on it here on the
screen just so you can see what's going
on here there's a core Android device
here that should be immediately familiar
to most consumers okay it's like you
know budget $300 pick up at Home Depot
phone software whatever it's just
surrounded by so much other stuff a lot
of these things I like you know like
like uh nice clicky buttons and a power
button fingerprint sensor you just kind
of do this a bit and see the phone
screen turn off and
on Flipping to the other side we've got
a pair of buttons here is the volume
rocker and then also another pair of
customizable buttons next great I like
customizable buttons our SIM card I mean
excuse me dual SIM and SD card tray here
on the side back of the tank has three
regular cameras an IR camera a regular
LED flash a when most of the cameras
just work and then they start IR light
that's how my life car work mive l Turn
Style flashlight and IR lights for the
IR camera bottom of the phone has the
USBC and the 3.5mm headphone jack under
a nice rugged port cover that should
help keep water out of there the top has
an IR blaster to use the tank as a
universal remote the projector and the
fan exhaust port and in the Shell is it
stick it in my laptop
23,000 800
milliamp support for 120 WT charging
I've been disappointed by a lot of
rugged devices in the past phones that
are expensive and durable built for
demanding conditions but they're also
pretty low power compute gadgets here
we're not attacking the premium tier of
devices but the dimensity 8200 on tap
this is a great chip and the RAM and
storage back it up nicely I'm spending
time with the 18 gigabytes of RAM model
with 500 in oh so they made an actual 18
gigs
model but in the chip be able to handle
all those abs and the running them gig
of storage all that RAM and storage and
we can still pop in two SIM cards and an
SD card just to really back up what we
can uh carry with us out in how good is
the camera there that's important the
screen is a decently bright IPS LCD with
support for 60 HZ I'd expect it to get
really bright since you're going to be
using it outside half the time 120 htz
and adaptive refresh rates and we've
recently seen an arms race in OLED
brightness and this feels feels a bit
more traditional work phone if a little
less vibrant it's eminently practical
easily read outdoors and respectable
image quality when you're inside
watching maybe your favorite animated
Spider-Man feature the size the density
of this whole package is just kind of
funny for
whoa how we normally review phones like
you want to talk about the haptic motor
well the haptic motor has to make its
way through a shell that has
significantly more mass it's got one of
those sort of fuzzier haptic Motors on
another you'd probably feel that a
little bit more readily but here it's
vibrating and transmitting through a lot
more stuff and the cameras are okay
another area we often have to deal with
more significant compromises on rugged
phones these aren't going to win any
photography awards for the year but oh
yeah but for Stills they're not terrible
we get some Punchy colors a good zoom
range we can even capture raw files this
this is an okay system pretty nice yeah
I really like phones with with flat
sides that you can really hold on to
like there a proper camera but but this
is so big you have to be careful
handling it I was crouching to take a
shot and I dropped it on my foot and it
hurt this hurt my foot you guys don't
know the things I have to do to make
these video reviews for you but talking
about the cameras the video is not great
at least not in terms of stabilization
it's super jittery in 4k it's got a bit
of that lower bit rate feel to it the
camera is really the only time I think
this phone feels slow or laggy like when
switching modes or tapping to focus my
phone is not the snappiest but then
there's also this other sensor an
infrared camera is an interesting hook
giving us night vision and it's
hilarious how the phone overexposes most
shots at night because of the IR lamps
you regularly need to turn down the
exposure but it's a unique feature to
add to a f speaking of unique features
this has a projector on it nice could
you imagine just walking into a room and
being like o ooh I think Joy have better
battery say week on a charge well I mean
this phone would give you a week on a
charge could you imagine oh uh final
question I got into my Facebook uh but
not Facebook Messenger it wants to log
in code but I don't
care what do you mean by login code it's
probably sending it to email could you
imagine walking into a spy presentation
be like so we captured these photos at
night we get the newest Rock You just
like
there's a little DLP setup that gets
Punchy and bright but it requires active
cooling so we've got a little intake
there and a little exhaust fan there
once you get this turned on once you get
it fired up it basically just sort of
screen mirrors what's ever on your
display and then you've got some extra
uh settings that's pretty nice I wonder
if you could play the
game in the projector mode to lock
orientation I never get to play with the
tank 2 Pro but I've heard some
complaints especially uh looking at the
spec sheet here for the tank 3 Pro that
this projector is a lower resolution uh
projector than what was on the tank 2
this is firmly standard definition fair
and you can kind of see that I Think
It's tricky because at the banding but
that could just be only for the Camas I
mean this is kind of like reviewing
earbuds or headphones where you're most
likely to use aggressive noise
cancelling technology is also where
you're least likely to try and reproduce
an audio file grade listening experience
so where you're most to use a tiny
portable projector you're probably
dealing with other situations that make
it unlikely you're going to replicate a
proper home theater experience as I show
you a video of this projector perfectly
focused from my camera the screen door
effect is very clear but as you're
watching content it's really not this
bad IRL I you can clearly see it but as
images are moving it's up to you how
distracting that might be I think it's
funny is if you perfectly focus and then
ever so slightly misfocus it's kind of
like bad anti-aliasing I mean it sort of
Smooths out the hard digital lines and
blockiness and a few odd choices like
there's this dial on the side with kind
of these like spiky ridges to focus the
image there's no digital or motorized
Focus but there is auto Keystone
adjustment uh to correct for the angle
of the phone when you project it against
a wall or a screen oh oh I thought I
meant Focus for the like for taking
pictures like wait doesn't have
autofocus for how big and how chunky
this thing is this speakers are kind of
on the thin or the hollow side now I'm
going to leave this running with the fan
because I feel like if you were going to
use the projector and you didn't want to
cart around extra speakers this is kind
of the audio experience you'd be in
for dang this isn't
[Music]
good
what
happened I think the projector is fun I
think it's a it's an interesting add-on
to have to sort of a portable compute
device like this but with the fan being
so audible you'd probably want to
connect this to some kind of Bluetooth
speaker or I mean plug headphones
directly into the headphone jack it's
the advantage of having a massive power
bank that even with a fan running you
can watch for a really long time
projecting I mean this could probably
last longer than say your TV well Che
but like a tablet hour a video I only
saw the battery drop roughly 10%
software on tap 1 hour video dropped
10% is Android 13 no fancy skin that I
can detect but lots of custom code to
run all of these additional Hardware
features there's a cute little tool boox
that gives users some practical tools to
play with like Compass a level a
flashlights tool to get water dirt out
of the ports on the phone uh using that
those vibration Motors I mean it's just
a Hallmark of rugged phones that there's
always an app or a collection of little
mini apps that has rugged guy outdoor
things to do by these are kind of fun
they are helpful and it's the kind of
stuff I would have freaked out about
when I was a kid when I was a boy scout
if you like gaming phones uh gaming
laptops uh building your own PC or if
you like the nothing phone in that glyph
interface I mean sure you have some
pretty lights on the back of your phone
but can your phone really brightly
recreate the experience of having police
lights in a
siren let me turn I I I didn't even know
that that had audio associated with it I
I only tried this with the speakers
muted before but hello fellow officer I
too am police guy you can imagine like
walking up to a crime scene with your
phone imagine turning that mode on and
then you see a criminal and just throw
it at his head he KN gets knocked out in
full Hazard mode and it is stuff like
this I'm not sure I completely get
because having hazard lights on a phone
that could actually be kind of kind of a
good idea like I'm the kind of nerd who
still keeps an emergency kit with road
flares in there but if we were trying to
caution people wouldn't those lights be
yellow not red and blue one of the
Hallmark features of this is obviously
the ginormous battery it is hum oh I
could charge my laptop with that humous
you have almost five times the capacity
of a premium phone ooh o powis
responded
[Music]
okay
[Music]
so runtime as a phone is really long
it's the difference between other phones
saying you get a full day of runtime but
they really mean kind of like a 12-h
hour day of mixed use and I mean no one
uses their phone for 24 hours a day
keeping the screen off for a good
portion of that time here we can measure
specific activities uner says you can
run it for 48 hours of watching video on
the screen whoa two whole days I could
fly to Japan
download Netflix movies and I would
still be at 50% in my short tests that
sounds about right I couldn't take two
days just to run the battery down for
one specific you usage test 98 hours of
listening to
music okay okay that means I could
literally take vce n say is about 4 and
hours with the
content I could listen
to about a fourth of the
episodes okay that's about 250
episodes or if you're talking about the
old
times about 20
albums you know what sure I'm just give
you that I I that sounds good let's go
with that and normally when they
couldn't make it to 100 though kind of
sad we talk about fast charging it's so
amazing you can fully charge a phone in
30 minutes but that's not what's
happening here it takes about two hours
to fully charge this from empty to full
it is so hard running tests like that
because it took days to run this phone
down plugging in to occasionally top off
is definitely the better way to go I
currently have 20% on this batter right
now and I'm not worried about it running
out in the next day or three and while
we can certainly joke and this capacity
is Extreme it makes sense in a lifestyle
where you'd also want this handy to top
off for other smaller portable G it
would be nice if this like went down and
then it filled up as your battery went
up if it was a screenit we've got 10
watt reverse charging through the USBC
unfortunately that's not enough juice to
trickle charge a small laptop but for
but it's decent for accessories or if
you o need to keep a tablet Juiced out
in the field we kind of mentioned
performance I wonder if it can charge
cameras but I do want to kind of circle
back to this kind of cover this here our
rugged phones are built to be practical
but we really haven't had fun options
since the old Galaxy Active days and it
still kills me how Samsung discontinued
that line of phones my last Kera review
that phone had a Snapdragon 480
definitely not a screamer this bad boy
running that Dimension chip it puts it
in another tier of performance I
recently just showed
same chip in the vi the vi v30 and it's
a killer option for heavier CPU bound
tasks and it's a respectable solution
for gaming so what do we do with this
thing it's easy to point out how absurd
this thing is it's it's not like regular
phones what will the average consumers
say about it but that's kind of the
point and unihertz is one of the few
companies left still pushing more
extreme alternative form fact
there is absolutely no world where I
would hold up my pixel 8 Pro next to a
tank 3 Pro and as he's holding it up
right now earnestly recommend the same
device to the same consumer for the same
needs focus on the traditional form
factor you're just reviewing what this
thing is not instead of reviewing what
this thing is and let's be frank given
the track record from unihertz I would
not expect a ton of software support for
this I'm pulling it up on AliExpress
it's whoa that's a lot of money it's a
bit pricey so this is really more of a
tech Appliance if you're worried Tech
Appliance so weird to about the
smartphone stuff it's probably not going
to be a good solution for you but again
kind of hilariously it makes an argument
for a different kind of Weekender phone
I mean use your fancy nice phone during
the week and get your work done and and
usually I recommend people keep some old
little beater phone or a cheaper
mid-ranger to take out to the beach or
when you want to go on a hike or a camp
out but the opposite approach would be
something like this spending a little
more on a tech appliance that can also
fulfill some of your phone communication
needs you're going to buy it in this
state you know what it can do in this
state immediately out of the box is
probably going to stay relatively close
to this state but we should be able to
think of a few people in our Circles of
family and friends who I mean this might
fit the bill by Design This is a
solution I mean I I don't know anyone
who would need that it's a much smaller
potential demographic of consumers so
ultimately I have to score it well based
on the claims the manufacturer makes
this does the things that unah Herz
claims it can do and it does them rather
well it's the laziest no-brainer kind of
review fodder to trot this out and go
well it's not going to be for everybody
yeah that's obvious whether or not it's
the right fit for your needs is a very
specific accounting of personal
preferences all right seems like a
pretty good phone uh in my opinion would
I buy it probably not but I mean it's
decent and um if anyone has any
questions uh say them now if not let me
check to see if we have anything
else and remember guys to go follow Ava
harer a haror
uh let's see anything else in Tech
no God bless and Tech talk to you
later</pre>
