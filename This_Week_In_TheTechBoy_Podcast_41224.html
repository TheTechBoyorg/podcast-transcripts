<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 41224</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to the this
week in the Tech booy podcast hello and
welcome to the tech boy This Week in
Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
our first special Friday episode
and I have special um news for um you I
believe I
found I have found the
sanest teenager on the
internet and also I probably found some
of the dumbest ones uh but kind of funny
on all
Natures so first let's get to say is
teenager on the internet
um and honestly it's kind of a shock I
found this posted on a vlogging
Channel about
fashion who who talks about their day at
school I mean that's it's next
level saying here we
go we've got brand new merchandise up hi
guys all right we're not watching the
whole thing obviously but but here we go
let's get to the same part i' have to
comment on here somewhere all right 4:42
get as special as it
should I believe the question is oh yeah
it's supposed to put
nice uh what's it called time stamps
down here so here we go 4:30 first kiss
is what is my first kiss story I've
never actually had my first kiss I feel
like
congratulations J is saved you know I
was once called on NTV the uh or maybe
some live stream somewhere The Last Hope
for Jin Z I believe that we um found my
backup most people by my age have had
multiple kisses I don't know I just feel
like I just feel like kissing that
people like don't make it as special as
it should be I don't want to just like
kiss someone to kiss someone you know
like I gotta
say I think America might be saved but
then then we got uh we got more we got
more um Clips
here um 7:46 let's
go such a hard question from oh the
question was what's your favorite book
in the Bible cut off the answer because
I really love so many books of the Bible
obviously but hav CH that reminds me of
a music movie clip um from this musical
that uh it's going to get ripped what's
it called
[Music]
here we go yes you should see it on the
screen here from Netflix now first week
um first glance this may not look like a
Christian musical but it actually it
actually is it's very Christian super
Christian is um so the kids are asking
this boy here what I know the image is
terrible my gosh this um the kids are
asking this boy here what his favorite
book of the Bible is and they're like uh
it's all of them but he he doesn't know
what the books of the
cuz he um right before he got sent to
that camp he was stealing a
car back to I'd probably pick Proverbs
but she can actually name b of the Bible
there we go let's go next question I got
all right and then down to the
um
ah question 814 you have a boyfriend I
do not oh my gosh it's me we have we
didn't see is saved people moment have a
boyfriend I don't know if you could tell
by my answer of first kiss I don't have
a boyfriend along with that question
comes have you ever had a boyfriend I've
had what I would say to be near
boyfriend experiences okay then then we
get into that in nbe sounds like
something that I would come up with ah
yes we got a kidex over here she
experien an nbe of kid y according to my
calculations D yeah um
no nbes okay it's a pretty useful term
probably gon to use it no one's going to
know what I'm talking about but it's a
useful ter in the past obviously I've
had like Middle School relationships
where it's like like you guys both like
have crushes on each other you date for
like two months and then you break up
and it's just like no one cares but well
that's true but you know there's also
the net uh as aspect of it especially
now like she's a I mean super super
duper famous YouTuber a lot more famous
than me almost has uh oh yeah there we
go over 200,000 subscribers right and um
using my powerful ENT skills I can
probably figure out what schools he goes
to attend face and all of
that right
so I mean she'd have to be even more
careful you know make sure she doesn't
like provide too much information to
some random boy who pretends to try to
date so you can hack into a YouTube
account yeah it's the same thing like
you know as you guys know as she said on
this channel multiple times you're
talking about
detectives um and how it would wouldn't
be good for detectives because they goow
them off the case and they can use crush
the to like manipulate them and get to
do stuff that they want to do but you
know right we've gone over it lots of
times like but I mean for even even for
her that could be potentially dangerous
because they could like try to extort
have her password for her YouTube videos
and then like steal all the money
because she has brands on Instagram so
um you know be careful and I'm glad to
see seems
sane that's a high compliment these days
sanity um speaking of
Sanity let's talk about this movie here
uh week
away now let me give you the plot this
kid um here okay is uh he's he's a
Criminal kid who's about to get sent to
juvie cuz he doesn't have any parents
and he was just uh he just stole the
police car but just just in time some
new foster parents come in and
um they it's either he goes to this Camp
of his new foster parents um because
they run it and they have this boy who's
like 13 around his age and uh or he goes
to ding So eventually he decides to go
to the camp and they go to the they go
to the
um what's it called
camp Camp house I guess cabin of him and
his new brother
um at at the edge of the woods right um
this is like the creepy cabin that has
spiders and well not spiders but like
what do you call them dead stuffed
animals yes and it it's creepy and no
one really likes it and um so this guy
asked his friend uh brother hey why why
do you stay in this cabin then till he
looks out the window and he sees that
it's closest to the girl's cabin where
this boy is trying to date this girl
named Presley something something
something um so now he can I guess more
effectively
surveil
um and then this kid sees this kid and
he's
like right so and then that movie
follows the that whole plot and then
this this kid who uncovers what uh this
kid has done in his past life like
stealing cars getting kicked out of
foster homes and everything like that
um and he's trying to um get rid of him
because he's a competitor to him like
they're on different teams so he's like
on the green teams he's on the red team
and the other kid was on The Blue Team
um so basically there's three main story
lines here okay uh the new kid is trying
to I mean the boys are trying to you
know date the girls
um the kid on the blue team is trying to
get um this new kid kicked out by
investigating him and his crimes against
humanity I guess and um also he's trying
to you know learn more about Jesus and
has more conflict there and I have to
tell you this plot of this movie is a
atosis first of
all
um literally this kid gets off the bus
and then he starts dancing with this
girl as soon as he gets off the bus like
really come on and then and
then they just you know start like kind
of sort of dating I mean literally they
are dancing on a bridge right
here after she takes him into the forest
now I don't know about you but if some
random girl Tri to take me into the
forest I I don't think I'd go you know I
I'm smarter than that you know what if
she try to like I don't know kill me or
something like that like hey come to the
forest with me alone this doesn't really
sound
smart Okay
um second of all
uh is this girl I mean apart from the
you know dating this random kid for it's
kind of a lot like me right she's like
super competitive and everything like
that I mean to the point that even when
they team up on paintball even on the
different teams she shoots them back
which is kind of smart but not that very
nice not that very Christian but then
she's kind of like really excited for
him when he wins but I mean her entire
thing is that he's competitive and he
stays at the camp and you know I'd be
competitive like if my friend was on
another on another team you think I'd be
running around ching with him
uh and then just I mean this kid he
should be in jail he should be like oh
well you know he stole the police car so
you need to go to summer camp or you go
to
juvie and he doesn't even do anything
while he's there 17.6 miles away from
calization as I say like I mean he could
be like scamming the other campus and
everything it's just just kind of weird
all right now let's get down to the uh R
teenagers subreddit and I have collected
the most appropriate I think I'm not
expert on that because I'm not plugged
in you know um
um alleged pickup lines that they have
on here and as an obvious exper on these
things I'm going to um review them like
someone was going on waiting them and
these have got to be the
most just the
saddest all right here we go
all right so let me pull it up on the
screen hopefully you can see this on a
state of one to America how fre are you
tonight I mean
points for patriotism but that's just
sad
okay wa what is this is it true that you
can't get over Minecraft V can you not
get over mine not not
man and I'm I'm seriously hoping that a
boy would did a girl well okay is your
last name Kennedy because I'll blow your
mind just oh my God
go just
just tell me your Dad is working at
Google because I found everything I'm
looking for in you that doesn't really
make sense like what who dad has nothing
to do with this but okay the sky is
beautiful today I mean no one really
says the sky is beautiful today you
think I'm running around you know hey
guys look the sky is so beautiful today
uh no too bad I can't enjoy it cuz I
rather to look at you how long are you
looking at
[Music]
people oh my gosh are you cing because I
want to pick
you so sad so
sad are you an attractive large body of
w that is surrounded and part partly
surround and Legion into an ocean
because you're a cute
sea how much time do these people have
on their
minds you know these people are
literally sitting here I'm sitting here
calculating on how to you know war game
to score these people are sitting here
talking about this uh please tell me how
this is going to help contribute to the
last small defense but okay are you're a
magnet because you're doing a great job
at attracting me which would also mean
that you are the opposite of the person
that is attracting
you so um also magnets don't
discriminate against other magnets so
again work on your science are you Kim
because I can't say anything bad about
you I'm not a dating expert but uh
comparing people to communist dictators
as a pickup line is probably a bad idea
quote of the year right there um here's
another North Korea one are you are you
North Korea because I can't leave you no
matter how hard I
try again comparing people to communist
dictatorships uh in in a state of a what
do they call
this
uh not
accomplishment compliment it it's just
you know kind of weird is not something
that you do all the time you know you
know I think I call my oh it's just like
China I can't you know you're a great
looking CIT like huh no
anyway Samsung Samsung your favorite
South Korean and
actual benevolent
democracy
uh is revealing the AI features to the
galxy s22 and S21 series as well as the
accom Z4 flip series um to the phones
via 1 UI 6.1 beta on my phone uh right
now galxy s22 plus but mark my words in
10 days I will have the s24 ultra in
fact I'm gonna have it tomorrow that's
right I'm gonna have it tomorrow I'm
gonna do an unboxing video of this and
then sell this piece of junk anyway on
my phone uh s22 plus is going to um
get all the AI features promised on the
Samsung Galaxy s24 series except
except the
um
Galaxy slow motion which is kind of sad
it'd be nice to do some slow-mo on my
phone anyway here we go the following
devices will get this to of AI with the
G s23 Fe level of
AI s22 s22 plus s24 Ultra fold four flip
4 S8 uh tab S8 tab S8 plus and tab S8
Ultra
and the
um one's coming to 2021 says that the
S21 and the foldables launched out in 21
2021 um will support Circle to search
and Magic rewrite which these people
think that's General edit I think magic
rewrite is the um typing thing
uh so what are the features that the s33
F you will
get all right let me check let's check
here okay okay here we go so here's the
2023 Series so this is probably what the
s24 is uh two it's going to get so go to
search Chat assist interpreter live
translate notic assist transcript assist
browsing assist generative edit edit
suggestion not instant slow-mo and then
generative wallpaper now if you look
into all of these so good to se I mean
you could end probably add that to like
a any phone so it's just been gate cap
um chist again that's in what's it no T
might actually be a lot a a little bit
harder a live
translate
um that actually might take some
processing power because I don't think
the thing look calls to and bringing
them back to translate so it's probably
doing it all on device note assist and
transcript assist pretty useful there
because that's to summarize large amount
of data um and also voice data browsing
assist it's basically the same thing but
you know on online on a browser so it
can probably send it there easier edit
suggestion I mean sure a instant slow-mo
that's a processing thing so that's not
really going to come and in general
wallpapers that's a Google thing that
Samsung for himself for you know
advertising or something like that so
yeah congratulations to Samsung
for adding that I'm G add that my phone
will be getting it for the next person
who has it because I will have an s24
ultra um
tomorrow mark my words
okay never seen that before
um also the a the find my
network has um been
extended this time it's the um Google
find my network
um it is is a
tool that lets you find your phone and
devices um it's rolling out kind of like
the image Network so it's going to like
pick it back off the connections of
other devices here we go five ways to
use the new find my device on
Android interesting oh that's a remote
not a flip phone
okay so you can locate your offline
devices um
because they'll be able to connect the
other devices be able to connect them to
other Bluetooth tags so I'm glad about
that also glad that other companies
getting into it like U mola because my
Samsung tag they're not doing well I
lost mine and it's it's not there
anymore I have like a flash drive
connector it's so sad way back in
November so I didn't even get to finish
the review of it because I got in
October
um you're going locate nearby things and
find stuff at your house using n
devices um if you have
to though I mean that's not that useful
like Housey lasting living room speaker
like that just gives you like one room I
guess unless you have like multiple
speakers and then you can share stuff
with your friends and family so that's
great glad that you can finally do that
those does mean you know make sure you
have a strong Google account password
because it's going to be know easier to
find youo even if you go offline or turn
off your
phone all
right appears that the ambo to the pin
the what's it
called Humane AI pin
launched
and it did not do well Mr the boss and
Mr
mobile um roasted
it let's put it up here on the screen
there's a lot of
notifications let me just put it up
here mr's boss actually got to go with
the CEO are you single maybe you're
divorced or new in town it's time to
meet your match with Events and
Adventures whether you're here you go
this is the Humane AI pin it's been
blowing up the internet over the last
few months with the combined
intelligence of sophisticated AI plus
the entire internet all being brought to
you in a way that you can still be
completely present in a moment and not
bogged down by the hassle of working
around intrusive addictive phone
application again the idea of selling a
device selling like paying money for a
device that says hey we're not a phone
we um we actually don't want you to use
the phone and actually selling people
for money that is
wild like never in human history has
someone been able to effectively start
an entire business I mean they got
investors okay
obviously by saying hey look people are
addicted to their phones so I'm gonna
make a device not to get them to stop
them from getting a I'm gonna make a new
device either a worst version of that
device like that new phone with the
keyboard with e display that's a worst
version of a smartphone right OB going
to make a totally new version of the
device I guess basically a smart watch
with the projector screen is that that's
what it is and I'm sell it to people at
the same price as their normal thing
because and then say hey this going to
get you off your phone so actually is a
device that we don't want you to use the
less you use it the better you are right
but the problem is the way most you know
internet services work right the more
you use it more data they collect the
more ads they can sell right that's the
way things work so if if you telling
people to use less of a device then
you're not going to get developers
you're not going to get apps not going
to get um people to come on board right
who are going to pay you so then you got
to bre in these exorb fees for a trash
device I mean never before in human
history have you been able to Market
trash and get people to buy
it like honestly
I mean I like
capitalism I mean I guess that's the
benefit of it you can sell trash on the
internet and people actually buy it I
mean it's not my fault if people are
stupid okay here we go and I just went
hands- on with it I spent about four
hours using it oh yes o a laser
projector looks like a prop from a movie
from 2007 that's great I mean the one
thing I can see someone thinking about
this is he maybe you can like cheat on a
test or something it's for the thing
when you're using the laser projector
according to Mr mobile overheats in 9
minutes 9 minutes now maybe if they um
marketed this as a phone assistant right
not a phone like replacement or
something or try to get you off your
phone L which it's kind of like in
between that
thing maybe sold it for $300 like a
smartwatch and you could just be like
and you could swipe through
notifications see text messages maybe as
the voice assistant do like basic things
and try of making this all encompassing
hey tell me uh get book me appointment
at the fery under the Brooklyn
Bridge yeah because you'll see why I'm
talking to the CEO Imran and I don't
think I've ever wanted to love a piece
of technology so much and yet still be
unable to who's Mr who's the boss from
[Music]
YouTube finding YouTube video I mean
this
voice it's bad but I mean you can always
change that like I mean nowadays if AI
technology you can take a 5sec sample of
someone's voice and clone it right so
you don't need to sit down there and
piece it together to make it say
anything else so they can obviously fix
the words but the it's so
slow like it's like kind of slow and
bixy AR also known Asos is a popular
YouTuber with a focus onology
so here's how it works it Clips onto
clothing it stays there on standby most
of the time and then only when you
decide that you want to engage with it
do you place your finger on this
touchpad and you speak for example when
do you think humans will settle on the
moon humans are expected to return to
the Moon in 2024 uh that's blatantly V
unless Humane has
um intelligence about um NASA that I
don't know maybe it's Prov it a
government secrets or
something so get stuff wrong all the
time you get like fact jacket or
anything there's no screen
so is it good well I'm really sorry to
say this because Imran the CEO he was so
nice in person and he was a great host
to us but no I don't think so this is a
really interesting category and I have
ideas for this could be something that
Best in Class pretty great but as of
right now the Humane pin is an
incredibly poor proposition just before
I get into that though I do want to give
credit where credit's due there are a
few things about this that are spot on
and they do make you realize the
potential oh hey with Z you could stream
free local TV from all over the country
Z speaks for itself it really doesn't
need a the starters I think they have
absolutely nailed the hardware so long
as you decide that you're okay with
wearing a chest pin then you probably
won't find a better one it's way smaller
me true though the camera angle it's
kind of weird because it's angling
downwards so
to swipe up and increase your volume or
double tap to take a photo or hold down
with two fingers to ENT that led thing
so unfortunately you can't use like a
body gam SPID though you could probably
put some tape over it interpreter mode
which I'll get to in a bit but the best
part of it is it means there are no wake
words you're not having to start each
interaction with hey Humane and that's
really really great and there realiz if
you had the options set that though the
battery life is awful so having to have
it always on might actually contribute
down to that so I don't think it's like
a oh privacy thing it's proba like
battery thing but then they can't say
our batter is weak so we didn't include
a wake words so they probably just mark
it were moments with it where I honestly
honestly they could say like the low
battery life is to um increase your
experience with the real world's better
I mean I could take some random trash
budget Android phone and say hey look
the screen is bad the um the cameras are
awful and the battery is
small but the screen is bad because we
don't want to
um well I say the screen is at a low
resolution to prevent you from hurting
your eyes the battery is small on
purpose to um allow you to interact with
the world real world more and the
cameras will never be as good as your
eyes so yeah know we didn't want
to ruin it or something like we didn't
want to ruin the experience of memories
for
you um let put that all in the marketing
demo sell it for $1,000 and people would
actually buy
it and then maybe put some like stupid
you
know
minimalist Home Launcher on
it put it in there for free so maybe
like the Home Launcher you can put on
your regular phone for $999 just bundle
it for free then you go on podcast and
talk about how great your phone is and
how it keeps you off your phone and
stops you from Doom scrolling and the
weak processor is actually a benefit
because I don't want to use it it's like
that's a phone that I don't want to use
what it could be I asked it what's this
tree in front of me and it told me it's
a Japanese maple and there was something
incredibly uniquely satisfying about
gaining that Insight without needing to
be interrupted from the moment with my
phone it felt like a g code because
let's face it as soon as your phone gets
involved that becomes your attention
anytime you take a photo on your phone
you are entirely focused on getting the
framing just right anytime you want to
look something up you're actually
looking down at your hand instead of
experiencing or another
example I mean you can voice search on a
phone too we've been able to do that
since like 2010 was the one time that we
used The Interpreter translation feature
and it actually worked well namaste
hello Imron it is a pleasure to meet you
the point is I see it I see the vision
and I see small twinges of something
magical but when you actually boil it
down to the practicality of using this
and wearing this every single day I
can't see a single angle from which it
makes sense I mean the first thing is
the price this is a $700 break down this
price I think he does a really good job
and $700 is a one off his
maybe just about digestible and you do
get I mean when you look at this yeah
you can probably get s24 Plus for $700
of eBay so either full smartphone or
maybe $800 right or this right $700
that's s23 territory s23 Fe maybe an
iPhone 14 so we're talking about you
know last year maybe this year's
flagships right little bit above upper
midrank FRS you need to use it they also
throw in you get a laptop for $700 you
know so it's not like I mean for the
size of the thing like it's basically
buying airpods PO for
$700 the battery boosters in the box
which between them is enough battery for
full day of use and to be fair other
other phone companions like say smart
watches about $300 less even if you want
less features or smaller screen maybe
220 and then even like $50 for the scam
ones
um airpods you know airpods 25 to say
you know or it can go up from there but
you know mainstream two25 to $200 right
and then AR goggles where you can plug
them in like use your phone screen and
see everything here and see all your
notifications and stuff $400 right
so this is about 300 to $500 more
expensive than most phone accessories
right so it should be $300 to $500 more
you know value whats but here's the
problem very little of the AI processing
is being done on the device so it needs
an internet connection and so because it
like you know SmartWatches they need
those connect to your phone right so if
it just you know piggy backed off say
the Bluetooth connection of your phone
I'd be fine with that like that'd be
completely
fine it's an internet connection it's
not just that it basically does nothing
when you're out in the middle of nowhere
but also it needs its own entirely
separate data plan so it's a $700 pin
plus a $24 a month subscription on top
of that and that's the problem that's
the problem you can't share data with
your phone because you know AI the the
pin needs the connection to you know
keep ping for the large language models
and everything like that they're
probably paying for API calls to open Ai
and stuff the problem with this is
the pin is useless without an internet
connection the contrary to popular
belief you can do a lot on a phone
without internet connection right you
can take pictures you can write
documents right now of course you might
have to download external apps to do
this but you can still do that I mean
there Leela the AI companion application
you install out on the phone you can run
it completely
offline um you can do some
coding um video editing
um note
taking video games as long as you
download them Ono you can play um
texting right um if you just have a
regular plan calling again if you just
have a regular plan GPS right provided
you download the maps
[Music]
um you can do
plenty on here mean maybe you could take
a picture but you can't even see it plus
taxes and fees and yeah that $24 does
also include unlimited AI requests on
top of that data wonder if it's possible
that someone will like hack that thing
like buy it and
then create their own chatbot using that
will P pass through
the Humane pin and thenell
it let me think about this there's $24 a
month for $700 in this investment right
and let's say they sell this Jet B with
unlimited queries um for 100 not1 $10 a
month
right they would
need about three
users to pay to pay for
itself that's it three users I mean PR
possible $24 a month is I mean that's
two times what I'm paying for my phone
contract if you want to go abroad and
carry on using the pin which is a big
part of its appeal because of this whole
translation feature there's an extra fee
on top of that and the worst part no
sense like you're going to carry your
phone a few right as for Ultra you know
translation capabilities you can buy
your own like dedicated transl if you
want it to
$22.99 um Andy translating applications
in in the store in the Play Store where
you can actually use a phone and you can
actually see stuff because I
specifically asked about this the minute
that you stop paying that monthly fee
the device stops functioning so let's
say that again on a phone let's say you
start paying for your internet in phone
plan sure you won't be able to make
calls at emergency sure you won't be
able to connect to devices but you have
an Android phone right go to the library
um you can download lots of apps
whenever you're there use them right you
can still use it it's a piece of junk
without internet I mean it's act
literally an internet paper weight it's
more useless than a Chromebook without
internet like even on a Chromebook you
can you do some documents Google Docs
Google Sheets um some you know look at
photos and stuff it's more useless than
a Chromebook don't be more useless than
a Chromebook without internet I used
this for two years where I've paid $700
for the device $600 for the subscription
$200 in extra taxes another $100 for
roaming fees and just to finish it all
off another $100 for the clip and the
latch as they don't come with it even
after $1,700 of investment into this
[Music]
$1700 for context that would be a Galaxy
Z4 5
about that's
crazy because you know you buy gc45 you
can use it as long as you want all the
apps all the data completely for free
right go to library get a hot spot
product as soon as I stop paying my
subscription because I mean would you
plan to pay it for the rest of your life
yeah you want to use this use let uh
let's see that is no it's 24 *
12 time
10 almost
$3,000 um probably about $3,000 with all
the taxes and fees and maybe you go
abroad to Costa once and roaming fees
that's crazy so $3,000 for context
Disney plus uh is$
13.99 you can watch TV on it right
something you probably do every
day
right
and yeah so that so in the same time
period you probably playay
about for Disney plus we can get new
movies and
stuff 1560
foros and they could you know go down up
I don't think human is GNA be able to go
down they probably will have to go up
probably not but at that point Humane is
basically saying that's your PIN
besides you start playing for Disney
plus now like Disney is going to be like
e the TV is useless
now a paper weight so fine it's very
expensive but if it's capability matches
that then maybe it's justifiable well
what Imran the again it's not bringing a
specific special AI model it's just
using some jet GPT stuff or some you
know in-house whatever I can use
co-pilot take pixel tree what is this
boom uh Google l boom founder was saying
to me is that the pin has the ability to
run not just one but many of the top
current AI models so like gp4 for
example which is a very powerful AI that
does usually require its own paid
subscription for you to use it has that
on the go all the time which is
definitely not to be sniffed at so one
of the things that he was saying he used
it for is when he's driving his phone
will be in his pocket his Focus will be
on the road but he has access to the
entire internet of knowledge so he'll
just decide I want to learn something
about sleep habits today for example and
this pin can bring that knowledge in
again pretty sure
and summarize it and speak it to you and
this is actually the first moment where
I thought oh that's interesting when
drisha my fiance does any kind of long
drive she often spends a good half an
hour beforehand trying to find a good
podcast to listen to during it and even
then they'll often Veer off topic or not
be exactly what she was hoping for but
this the world's information curated
exactly based on what you're asking to
hear in any given moment that could
solve it plus again useful but I'm
pretty sure you can automate something
you just hey chat TBT I mean heck they
even put in Volkswagen cars so I
mean the AI pin does understand the flow
of a conversation this isn't like old
school Siri where you're just
reintroducing the topic every single
time you bark a new command at
it you can talk in a very human
conversation ational way and it talks
back so my head started spinning with
the possibilities this idea of a
personal teacher wherever you want them
but then I tried it hey I'm really
struggling with sleep recently uh I'm
only getting 5 hours and I keep waking
up in the night what should I try and
[Music]
do analyzing sleep
[Music]
advice to improve Sleep Quality proba
come over own dialup sounds at this
point you can try the following be
consistent with your sleep schedule
ensure your bedroom is quiet your stock
advice look the at
Google conversational piece we're
looking at um opening up the microphone
for um follow on questions like that
yeah so the bubble burst pretty quickly
not only is it much harder to understand
than real person the AI doesn't have
that natural intonation and it's only
without that that you realize how
important that it is but it also just
takes ages and this was not a one-off
everything on the PIN seems to take time
call
Aaron I me honestly this isn't going to
get me to use my phone less it's going
to get me to use my phone more in your
PIN less probably like cancel my
subscription like even though voice
assistance on this SL
[Music]
is it oh there you go it's only having
experienced that myself that long to
call someone my goodness that I realize
why in the company's promotional
material they're filling in all the
silences by talking make it sounds like
jenzy and what's cool is you can make it
more formal or casual or even do fun
things how's it going because if they
didn't tell in those silences it would
be awkward as hell now it's tough to say
at this point why everything takes so
long like even simple things like
sending a text or a call those should be
instant offline responses but they're
far from it so either this is just a
really slow device or the voice
processing itself also needs to be done
online or this is just the device
checking in online each time you ask it
something just to make supposed if it's
true that checking in online for just
check in like once a month make sure
that you're still paying the monthly fee
whatever the reason it is a big source
of FR could you give me a synonym for
the word great and a sub to the channel
would be
finding
synonyms synonyms for the word great
include fantastic marvelous talented
tremendous and wonderful we'll go for
marvelous if human intonation and all
right now let's see what the next thing
is oh yes here we go box it said without
a hint of caution the box contains fried
chicken nuggets there are 14 chicken
nuggets in the box now as you can see
here it's 20 but he using the camera and
it counted them and only
14
interesting well I think it's because it
can only see 14 yeah so how on Earth
will you ever be able to trust a
device's nutritional recommendations if
it doesn't even know how much of that
food there is I mean I talked to Iman
about this and he said well it's not a
medical device and the feature is kind
of in beta and that's all fair enough
but then what it is is an advertised
feature either it needs to get much much
better very quickly which I don't think
is going to happen because of the
natural limitations of what this thing
can see or it needs to make you more
aware of its limitations so that you
know you shouldn't be taking what it
says at face value the idea in theory of
let's say liking the look of this chair
and for the PIN to be able to not just
tell you what it is problem is that
because you don't have a
screen just Che just Che just Che just
Che some random chair that we can't see
on camera also save that answer to your
notes is appealing but when you actually
try and do that you realize what the Li
itations of this form factor are like
you can't see exactly what it's seeing
so I asked this exact question to it
about the chair and if we could do this
with ar goles you know you got the
screen your eyes you know with the
camera gave me a recommendation but then
I later realized that the recommendation
it gave me was a different chair in the
room and that's because when it gives
you an answer you have no way of
affirming that it's the correct oh I
almost forgot taking videos from the pin
15 seconds 15 unlike when you do the
same thing using Google lens on your
phone where you can make sure that
you're capturing the right chair and
then you can physically check that it
has identified correctly one thing that
Imran talked about was the incoming
ability to buy things using this but
given that there's no real scen want to
buy things off that just like pointing a
random body Cam and going like I want
that I want that yeah would you want to
buy things on this like what if I meant
to order two of something but the AI pin
mishears me and takes that as 20 what if
it misunderstands the size or the color
of what you want wanting and actually
orders an alternative variant there is
so much that could go wrong that you
really all right let's see what's the
next criticism or post a tweet that says
this but it can't do that when you
message someone it's not a WhatsApp it's
not an iMessage it's just a straight SMS
message when you take a photo oh oh yeah
yeah isn't it is you know I was saying
that when you move your hand back it
gives you this option to share that
photo yeah well since there's no apple
airdrop and there's no Android Quick
Share the only way to actually share it
is to SMS that person a link to be able
to download it like imagine after a
party you know people say oh can you
send us the photos you took and then you
actually send them an SMS link for them
to be able to download that's not that
bad but people people are Weir those
photos one photo at a time at the Humane
web Center they're going to think of
some sort of time traveler and not in a
good way oh yeah so the Humane web
Center this is where all the stuff on
your AI pin gets backed up to every
great but I mean hackers I mean turn
that it's docked and it's on Wi-Fi and
in a way this is kind of cool the
company saying that you get unlimited
storage as part of your subscription
card which again someone could
try Hack That and use it as cloud
storage $24 a month for unlimited cloud
storage pretty so you could like figure
out how to get all like your phone
photos on there and stuff and this web
Center is one place where all of your
photos your videos your notes all the
requests that you've asked it for it all
comes together but does that also defeat
the entire purpose like okay if the goal
of the pin is for you to rely Less on
apps but at the same time they're
telling you that it's not designed to
replace your phone then you're still
going to be using all your phone apps
your Google Drives your otes and you're
still going to need to keep paying those
subscriptions but now you have a whole
extra Suite of Humane apps that your
stuff is further scattered across if
this pin came out before the first
smartphone then who knows maybe it could
have set yeah
Noah back then everything was email
email email you want people send an
email to Mary saying that um I need my
Excel spreadsheet on my desk by nine and
of course I want to read the Excel
spreadsheet that the precedent for a new
type of computer with a new way of
working but we are in a world now that
is built imag read an Excel spreadsheet
and like a LCD blue on your hand are you
crazy the smartphone and given that I do
not see a world where a smart device
that doesn't actually connect in with
any of your existing smart devices is
useful as it I mean look at it it's cool
but not really useful I guess we're
going to end off today God bless Tech
talk to you later</pre>
