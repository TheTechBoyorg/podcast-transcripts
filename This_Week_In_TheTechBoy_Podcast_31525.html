<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 31525</h1>
<pre>welcome back to this weekend The Tech
booy podcast hopefully you guys can hear
me this time unfortunately the stupid
microphone button on my computer was uh
tapped it really should have a bit more
of an alert for that especially when
you're going live or streaming glad we
caught that um before that so let's just
get back into our Tech headlines for
today we have so much to bring to you
today we ALS we have um we're doing
something new we're going to be doing a
tier ranking thing we're going to be
doing a uh we're going to be talking
about some new
um Tech things also this is all first
time ever in at least eight months that
we're streaming live over on Twitch so
we are not U multistreaming but we are
try streaming today I'm going to be
reading the comments and watching the
comments over here on my phone um I
haven't seen anything via YouTube but I
have seen things on the other two
channels that we're doing including
twitch so that is good right so um we're
not going to be doing ouro just yet it's
going to take a bit of time in the
podcast and I really want it to be you
know good and funnies but let's talk
about Affinity so
um if you guys haven't noticed we've
done a new logo redesign I've been doing
some new designs um as well in fact I'm
going to see if I can bring up the logo
on the screen but anyway Affinity is
this Suite of software that instead of
having to pay for
um subscription based like Adobe um you
can pay for your software via you just
pay for it once right I'm using the free
trial anyway with affinity um it has uh
graphic design software like uh whatever
Adobe thing it's called I forgot and of
course its own thing called Affinity
photo which is a replacement for Adobe
Photoshop unfortunately there's no video
editor I think I would actually like an
affinity video I to do so um developers
get in on that as well um there's also
Affinity uh publisher or something like
that which is like a replacement for
Microsoft Publisher which is
unfortunately dying in 2026 I don't know
why they would do that um also you know
Affinity um has great features um I I
actually really like the features
however there are a few problems so
first of all um it's selection tools
compared to even selection tools on a
phone um the AI selection tools and the
just regular selection tools like when
you tap the screen you p hold it down
you have your image or you um have your
second thing like
uh I forgot what it's called but you you
you have your second thing
um where you tap the screen
and uh and like draw around it or even
your generative field technology that
Samsung and even Google and even Apple
which is terrible but they still have it
but that Apple has I mean it it it's not
that good um compared to even what you
can get on the phone you know for free
so hopefully you know they they get that
a lot a lot better
um so I'm going to show you what the Lo
new logo looks like this is one of the
rough drafts but I have lots of fun you
know playing with this with offline
software as you guys know I'm an
advocate for offline software in fact I
was playing around with Ina today
incarta still looks pretty good in fact
I learn some fun facts today now this is
probably wrong it's from 20 years ago um
but you know it's still useful you can
still you know learn something um I'm
going to change this layout there we got
one and two
um for fun fact in 2005 the country of
Israel had about
1,200 phones for every 1,000 person so
1.2 phones for every one person so
apparently just they they were at least
one of the top countries that had cell
phones um at at that time because even
in the United States you know the
country that invented the cell phone we
were about 600 almost 700 cell phones
per person which I found really
interesting um not 700 cell phones per
1,000 person not 700 C phones Po and
that would be ridiculous um but I I
found that to be interesting you know an
interesting uh statistic that you you we
can learn from incarta and I think that
incarta you know it's still a pretty
good software like it still holds up um
in my opinion like it it it it does a
really really good job all right now
this is the logo that was designed um
this is the color logo we also did a
black logo the black logo is what you'll
probably be seeing on uh online uh like
for for the website this is this is uh
the new logo so oops swing myself back
in so yeah this is this is the new logo
now as you can see we do have some uh we
have to do a full episode about this but
we do have some Easter eggs hidden in
here you see and we have the American
flag over in the circle and the Texas
flag in the second T and the TCH boy um
but there are tons of Easter eggs I
forgot how many are in here um but I'm
just going to give some Clues there's
one in that Circle there's one in the
radio waves there's one in the alphabets
and there's also one in the B of the the
mezel of the device oh and there's also
some inside the color inside the orange
or black color depending on the one that
you look at so um that is our new logo
redesign thank you to affinity for that
hopefully they can get their magic F or
magic selection technology to be a
little bit better because you know I was
in
the I I I was in the I was editing the
think um
I want to see my stream on Twitch I'm
just G to you
checking all go it is there is audio all
anyway um I was trying to edit this
person right um from you know fatter or
skinnier right the problem with that is
that you know when you edit them down
the background which was like a couchs
whatever is you know going to be missing
there going to be some missing input so
you could do it the old fashioned way
and try to clone or like copy and Pace
but the thing is the select Tools in
Affinity are just really really I mean
they're garbage you have to hold down
shift you have to do this it's easier to
delete the selection this the copy and
paste the selection is just really
really bad especially the magnetic
glasso tool in my opinion when anyway I
was able to do that but you know it
didn't really look that well if I wanted
to make someone you know smaller in you
know
Samsung gallery application you all you
have to do is hold them down you copy
paste them maybe can you can even insert
things into the own Gallery you do that
if you miss some information Samsung's
Galaxy AI will intelligently be able to
fill it out and this is a phone you know
it's doing it all Ser side well offly
you know this computer you know not to
brag here but this is an HP uh Envy X360
laptop in fact that's what the sticker
says we got an Intel Core i7 processor
in here we also have 32 GB of RAM I'm
pretty sure you mean actually able to
run local AI models on my phone
including image generation and text
generation and they're not that good but
there's only 12 GB of RAM in here that's
about so we got about three times more
RAM in here of course we have a much
better processor not really sure how it
would um hold hold up right I
mean it should be able to generate a
little bit more information it's not
that big of a couch right it's not that
big of a background it's mostly the same
as well like it's spe have a little bit
more intelligent gener to feel you know
Photoshop has that come on ainy we
needed to do this as well of course you
know I'm not a paining customer cuz I'm
using the free trial but you know they
they should still listen to me cuz I'm a
tech blogger and what I have to say
matters all
right so that that was one of the topics
that we have to talk about today now the
next topic that we're going to be
talking about is perplexity as you guys
know I have said I have stated on
multiple occasions that if Google would
become you know bad right I would I I I
would change right you know but I am
still a major fan of Google um Google is
in my opinion the best search engine on
planet Earth right there's duck du go
there's bra you have all these other
conserv Tech uh you know search engines
so like hey guys we're trying to beat
the cens ship we have you know this
uncensured AI which is just bad it's
wrong all the time you have these people
you oh guys guys look look this
unscented AI totally agrees with a
completely unfounded in ridiculous
conspiracy theory that doesn't even make
sense see guys on cental AI um there's a
there's like
there's all these you know alt Tech um
social uh platforms out there that
they're just trash okay they are not
good um they they and and they don't
work well that that's that's the that's
the problem with with them okay
so let me I'm trying to get my camera
here so I can show you on the screen
anyway perplexity is the exception to
the rule so um you know I'm a fan of
Google but I am not afraid to criticize
them when when it when it when need be
right and criticize Google I will
Google Gemini AI is not that good okay
guys guys look you gotta be on tape
saying this Google's gimi AI is not that
good in fact there's a special report
that's saying that Google may switch
away from switch away from Google
assistant and make gim the number the
you know the uh default assistant Google
assistant is going to be there Jim is
going to be there jimai can barely tell
a joke like Jimi is so far behind in the
assistant fun space right it it it it's
not that good it has you know it's been
pushing those commercials um
relentlessly um you know during the
Super Bowl during Thanksgiving during uh
Christmas football games doing you know
all kinds of stuff like that but you
know I do say that gimi could be a lot
better which is why I replaced um which
is why I replaced my phone's default
assistant um not not not bxp okay we we
still have it there but that's that's
why I replace my phones default
assistant to being perplexity instead of
uh Google Gemini which it's a thing that
you can do and it's actually pretty
useful because like I said when cold
pilot came out I thought wow this is
useful this is great unfortunately it
doesn't have any integration with my
device so you know it it can't
do it it can't do much right so if I
asked it to like open up an application
or something then it's not going to be
able to open up the application cuz
there's no integration with the device
well gim was able to get that F
perplexity was able to get that fixed um
which is great so actually I'm going to
show up I I'm going to show you guys how
I switched over from perplexity to
um how I switched over from perplexity
um from Gemini I hope you guys can see
this on the screen I know this kind of
looks a mess I mean
see if I can fix that um while we're
while we're live have make this bigger
because I don't like that gigantic
number one that's into
it
slow can I just delete that
it's
gone there we go guys
woo anyway yes this is my this this is
the feed and I was talking about
perplexity and you know I I have said on
occasion of times you know
Gemini I say Google's better perplexity
is mid right but the thing is perplexity
has gotten a lot a lot decent um let me
see if I can find a thing
yes see look this is another thing that
I made with affinity you see the you
know the garbage uh can in here so you
know I had to do some cutting some
pasting for this application review that
I guess we we can get into um this is
the New Black logo by the way you can
see it anyway I made perplexity my
default assistant which is going to
replace uh gem right so I I found that
to be really really interesting
um here's what perplex can do we're
actually going to do a live
demonstration of perplex
right now I just want to make sure that
my banner is up
here oh no no no no no
no anyway we're going to do a live
demonstration of perplexity right now
right here we're going to do it um while
we are you know speaking to you right
now so I'm
just open up the device all right so
here's
perplexity open Ving
and as you can see as opposed
todi as opposed to um
Google gim which I don't think it can
open applications as opposed to you
know watch that out one uh Microsoft
co-pilot which I know could open up
applications it was able to open upid
now it is able to open up any
application it can make phone calls
let's see um I'm going to have it call
the Tech boy phone number
so
um that's not our
website our phone number which
is see I forgot it 845
32814 okay call 845
32841
0 and it's able to make that and it's
able to make phone calls in I miss said
the number but it's able to make phone
calls um on the device as well it's also
able to if you give it integration with
your contacts it's able to um call a
contact so um let me go find or make a
temp contact uh in here that's not
actually going to call someone um okay
let me see if I can edit this I'm going
to change my name in here to Bob all
right and you're not going to get to see
it on the screen because I'm not going
to link my number call Bob
and it was able to call Bob um did a
great job Bob from Texas all
right um you know so that is the power
of perplexity perplexity is also able to
do so so much more as well um you can
answer some questions it gives you
summaries Etc it's like an artificial
intelligence search engine but here's
the interesting thing about perplexity
perplexity is able to take you know what
your interest are and it's able to make
a supercharged AI Google schol discover
feed and that that perplex if you want
to pay me for that that's great right so
um you know DW has been doing these
advertisements in podcast where you know
they're going to have they have a host
goes in and you know you want to
research something per plexy will
generate some stuff for them that's
great right but the thing I like most
about this is the feed is actually
genuinely interesting and has long form
articles that are summarized and cited
within the thing within uh perplexities
artif social network so we have sport to
you have a head headline that says
Curry's record 43
Steph Curry shot 4,000 three point
12,000 points by the way and it gives me
a summary of what happen curated by
someone named Stefan hovin um Stephan
hoben I don't know if they're a news
reporter or anything like that anyway it
gives me a summary about what what's
happened and then it gives me a whole
bunch of articles about it from ESPN
ABC7 NBC Sports Bay Area so that go
would be the local you know California
newspapers here and then it gives me a
summary of what happens I'm just going
to read you the summary the M was reach
during 130 40 victory over the
Sacramento Kings at the chase center
with curry sing the historic shot with
8/19 left in the third quarter 1 two
right so that was all AI generated but
the on and twos um when you tap that
opens up to a news article in my browser
currently for fting um this is from ABC7
Warrior Steph Curry um reaches 4,000
career threep pointers right and this is
really interesting because you know you
can get a nice long feed of news
articles that are actually interesting
to you C going threes some tennis guy
doing something something you have some
entertainment news I also have it set
for you know Tech and science news and
it told me you it actually told me that
Gemini will be replacing Google
Assistant it tells me about the airpods
introducing live translation it actually
produces interesting stories that aren't
just local to me but stories that are
actually sit there and read so it's like
a combination of pocket which kind of
saves some stories for you which I
really need to get back into reading
more and also Google discover Samsung
news were actually being interesting has
a nice clean uncluttered interface and
it's not full of those you know MSN uh
msn.com you know news articles that no
no one actually cares all advertisements
that are placed inside of like the
Samsung news store or like news store
news stories from like across the pond
like I don't care what's going over in
the the independent what about or have
these stupid you know obviously scam ads
that are within Samsung news and other
news Gathering uh applications as
such it's just you know it's just better
and it's also you know it has a
but you can also go in deep and go in
and site sources if you want to as well
now it does have a few problems it's
able to open any application except for
the camera but that is because
complexity has its own camera
application in it as well because it's
able to describe either what's on your
screen or what's on here so we're just
going to take this this is uh I think
it's like one of those little robot
things okay open camera I wish you could
uh change the voice to sound like more
thing so it has its own built-in camera
what is
this so it's going to analyze the screen
content and I'm actually going to turn
up the volume so you guys can hear it
yourself you disrespect me you won't
tell me what it
is oh here it is well apparently we
missed it but I can read it to you
myself the object in the thing appears
to be a spical 360°
cam wrong all right let's try this again
let's try this
again swipe in what is this
but you to chat with it I could debate
it and tell it no it's not
that so let me open up the
camera take my picture so it has its own
inbuilt camera and you can also use your
own camera as well you can also upload
you know your own files he get Pro
searches so what is this and also it
save to search it his doing but it's uh
you know locked down so no one else can
see what it is I take a picture of my
charger here it's a phone charger should
be able to really get this it is kind of
slow because like you know Google Lens
would be faster than this like if I
opened up Google Lens right now it's
it's fine it's it's going to work in the
background open up Google Lens I hold it
up to the camera let's go Anchor It
identifies the brand it shows me um
things and even has its own helpful AI
some so this feels in of gem like the AI
summary thing that's good I actually
like that in search um but perplexity
it's come back with these results um ink
us wall Chargers designed to plug into
an electrical outlet and then you can
ask some questions about it so I do like
the Google n Google you know AI overview
as well but overall Gemini itself it's
slow it's ridiculous it doesn't
understand you know things in its own
context so like if I say um to to do
something you know it it ask it a
question uh it's going to forget you
know what the question before it was
sometimes you know it gives you know
ridiculous recipes as well so you know
Gemini is just not that good especially
Gemini live it's it's slow and laggy for
something that's supposed to be live so
I'm going to be Hardware testing um
perplexity for seven days using as my
default assistant alongside with um
perplexity and of course Google sorry
Samsungs Bixby don't want to forget
Bixby Bixby is best all right let's see
um no no go away no you're not the best
right now all right um we also have
another thing to talk
about all right let's see mid W audio
dramas so yes everyone knows that all
the audio dramas that are like in that
are in
um you know stories are always in set in
the midwest you have you know adventures
and ay you have uh you know um down GID
Lane you know most of the bigname audio
dramas are usually set in the Midwest
and I always got to wondering about that
like why are they in the Midwest and why
not like the only place I can think of
of audio drumers where it's actually
people like the Brinkman Adventures it's
actually people they're in they're also
in the midwest around the Milwaukee area
I think
um they like why why is the Midwest like
you know the Brinkman are real so maybe
it could be that one but I don't think
it's that I think the it's the Midwest
because what's about to be shown on your
screen as well as of the conditions as
well and I actually you know incarta
could have actually helped me I could
have done a nice little incarta
demonstration but this is pretend that I
got this information from incarta so
hopefully you
can see what this is input number six
hopefully you can see this on the screen
but this is a map of the United States
Midwest as you can see that is the
Midwest with its own percentage icon
here I did this I had to quickly do it
cuz I actually got deleted in Affinity
um this is from Wikipedia by the way but
not the percentages I the just myself
20% of the United States there over
60,000 no sorry 60 million people that
live in the uh in in in the midwest
right 60 million people live in the
United States Midwest compared to the
about 340 million people that live in
United States as a whole
and I think one of the reasons that they
picked the Midwest is look at that area
in red we got all these states we got
Ohio Indiana Illinois Michigan kin uh
Minnesota Iowa Nebraska North and South
Dakota um is canas in there I can't
really see cuz I didn't turn down
opacity but this is the Midwest the
Midwest this is the Midwest Midwest
contains 20% of the population also has
weather conditions that are you know
feasible for you know story so you have
the eventy episode Heatwave and you also
have the Advent and Odyssey episode snow
day right if they if Advent and odyssey
was based in say Tech
you can only have one of those episodes
right you're not going to be getting
snow there it's not really going to make
sense you're not going to be getting 15
in of snow in the great state Texas all
right we get four inches of snow we sh
down the city for uh like two days it's
historic and record breaking once in a
lifetime event right you know if they
put it in another city or a state like
Florida or California you know you're
also screwed there with with those
wether conditions and you know if you're
in like Idaho Wyoming Montana Maine you
know you're not you're not going to be
getting those Heatwave episodes like
highest temperatures that normally going
to be there is uh in is going to be you
like in in the 80s like in fact the
average July temperature put in Cara
thank you and Cara in Wyoming the great
state of Wyoming is like 63 degrees fhe
heat W just would really wouldn't make
sense there also there's only like
500,000 people there so it's going to
have to like a small town it's going to
be like three people in a dog right when
you have the the Midwest what you can do
is first of all you have weather
conditions that make sense across the
entire nation you have 20% of you know
your potential listen base too and you
also have um you know like kind of like
the same terrain or something or
whatever like like if you set in like
New Mexico or something or Arizona you
know you got desert that's all you can
play with right in the midwest you know
you got your planes you also have some
large cities but you know you you don't
actually have to specify a state which
means you can just make up terrain as
you want like in event Odyssey I think
there like some type of like really tall
Hill um in down Lane they can make out
whatever they want as well because you
know there could be mountains in say
Minnesota you know there's like lots of
lakes there where Jo got your PLS in
Iowa and Nebraska you got your big
cities in Wisconsin Wisconsin you also
have Chicago that's in
Illinois right so you can have all this
combined and you know kind of have a
little tapestry of giving a few hints as
to where it is but you can use all the
GE GE Geographic features of the Midwest
which I believe is bigger than even the
biggest states except for Alaska which
is just an ice box let's see is the
Midwest bigger than
Texas yes the Midwest is sign yes
according to perplexity the Midwest
spans an area of over 800,000 square
miles when Texas covers over uh about
270,000 square miles so when you set
your audio in the midwest you have about
three times more area that of in
geography of which to work with three
times more of the weather conditions of
which to work with then you would if you
even had in the second largest state in
the Union the largest continu uh in the
continuous United States of America
right and that's just Texas you know
Florida California Maine you know some
of these smaller States stuff you know
California and also you know there's a
whole event Nazi Trope of you know
California bad everyone please
California you know like we all knew in
alum 69 that when Jules went to
California I'm quite too he's going to
come back to us not going right off the
show so you know California you're kind
of screwed you're not going you're not
you California is not in any Christian
Audio Drama except for like the pond and
they go to California for like one day
and they come back which and also like
the pond and jungle sh they don't really
count cuz like it's it's a bunch of
animals in the forest and it's a bunch
of animals like sitting at a pond like
the pond could have been in Oregon Idaho
New York give me anywhere um Al also T
we also believe that t is also in the
Midwest and that's why in every of these
audio drums in the winter you have you
know you have your snow you have your
Christmas you have your Christmas theme
and also in the summer you got
your you have your heat right let's
let's go over to perplexity again and I
know perplexity is not paying me like
they're paying DW but you know uh may
maybe they'll pay me as well let's see
what is the average summer temperature
in Kansas is Kansas a midwest
state mid 7s to low 9s right you know
yeah that can be considered a heat wave
at least to low 90s right what is the
average winter temperature in
Iowa the average winter temperature is
14° but it's usually in the low 20s yeah
you can get 14 in of snow into there
does the Midwest ever get 14 inch of
snow
whoa Iowa they get 30 to 40 inches of
snow annually so they can also experence
winter storms occasionally exceeding 14
Ines in a single event boom that is why
in Midwest is the best for Christian
audio drummers it's also because you
know you you know you don't want to have
direct ties to any one state one Audio
Drama does um buck that twin Red Rock
Mysteries but of course that that's also
also based on a book you know it also
gives it Redrock is a fake place it also
you know Colorado's pretty big state um
how big is Colorado in terms of size
relative to the United States of
America Colorado plays a sign how big is
Colorado compared to the United
States Colorado Colorado is the eighth
logest state so you know Colorado is a
pretty big state you have you know
interesting terrain you also have your
you know you get you get some snow you
get some mountains so it makes sense why
V would be placed in there as well so
it's kind of like bordering the Midwest
um as you can see on the map you know
Nebraska is touching Colorado so you
know you might as well you might as well
add it to the Midwest um if you wanted
to as well let's make Colorado an
honorary midwest state all right now
speaking of Christian audio dramas
Christian audio dramas usually have this
Trope and you know it it's also in these
like this is especially prevalent in
Kids Corner Kids Corner has like only
200 and something episodes and it's like
like five or six Christmas episodes are
plays which why do you have five or six
Christmas episodes um or or plays um oh
know oops uh five or six Christmas
episodes of plays like that's that's me
make sense anyway it's just always this
Trope of like you know have this one
character who wants to make Christmas
the best Christmas it's ever been before
or let's make this this play it's ever
been before but then they always either
encounter like tried like that's what he
struggles with for the entire season of
like 20 season of kid this kid still
struggles with right why I don't know
like he he literally is a Christian
radio broadcast and a broadcast
canonically to hundreds and hundreds of
people so imagine this podcast were like
you know 10 times bigger right he's a
chrisan radio broadcaster but apparently
he still struggles with pride and like
one time he actually breaks into some
school and steals a statue like okay
sure let's go with that anyway
why why I don't know but but you know
you know no no no questions asked
here um anyway wait how many per day I'm
getting some
questions oh whatever I I answer that
question later um I'm going to go over
into twitch anyway so Liz likes to put
on these big Christmas Productions and
plays as well but he's not limited this
is also another Trope in um in in other
Christian audio dramas as well but you
know something goes wrong maybe it's
Pride messes up all the crowd leaves
there's also this like movie called The
Best Christmas production
ever where you have like
these scraggly kids running around
putting on a Christmas production or
whatever and I'm
like why is it always this like they
always try to do this big Christmas
production but then they always learned
a lesson at the end that you know you
don't need to have uh you don't need to
have a big Christmas reection like why
I'm not sure but yeah I'm not live
streaming YouTube unfortunately so uh
we're going to have to download this
from twitch hopefully you can do that
cuz I wouldn't want my YouTube
subscribers to miss out on the
podcast all
right I wish I could fix this live on
stream anyway these people they're like
like what are you doing please please
tell me what are you
doing like why why can't you have a big
a Christmas production it's always at
the end some random kid the GU comes in
and like play Silent Night and like wow
that's amazing that's
remarkable but on the flip side why are
your a Christmas Productions you know
we're going to make Christmas the best
Christmas ever we're going to teach all
these kids about Christmas and they I
guess they they didn't know the true
story well you've been on for 20 Seasons
how do you not know the true story of
Christmas already mean you you you can
only tell the same story like four or
five times before before it does that
it's the same thing in event NY Olivia
Parker comes in like which she's like I
know all stor so Mr W could put you into
a imagination St and adventure and she's
like wow I didn't know there was a
talking donkey in the Bible the Bible is
so
interest you don't know all the Bible
stories then you like that's one of the
most common Bible stories known to man
that's not like he put s on some Bible
you know Adventure talking about some
random you know judge of Israel
who's in this book like who are Jesus's
three friends no
no that's also a ComEd Ral
fact yeah okay I got to find some of the
uncommon Bible facts in this book uh
there there's a few of them inia but
like everyone knows the story of bam and
talking donkey okay like why would
didn't know Jonah play okay this is this
is getting out of hand this is
ridiculous okay um cuz you don't know
about the story you can't be coming into
which him like the Bible's boring I
don't know my Bible so it's come back
later when you actually know your bible
stories like it's
ridiculous all right now let's get into
the meat and bones or potatoes whatever
the thing saying is of our podcast we're
going to be doing ranking I'm going to
be ranking not ranking RZ but just
ranking
um birthdays it's good to have your
month your your your birthday month and
me pull up
the um display you see no I want number
seven do we have
it I want my PowerPoint there we go
we're going be
ranking
the the months is best to have a
birthday and based on let's say like a
new kid coming in to a school yeah a new
kid coming in to to a school whatever
like when one of those
sitcoms um so anyway this is oh I got to
move this
way yeah anyway uh we're going to be
ranking the best month since to have a
birthday and we're going to start with
September cuz that's when the school
year starts so
um let me present this for you
guys you can see this right I can't see
okay
whatever so this is our tier ranking
list but first we have to have uh I made
a presentation of all the months of the
year and we're going to go in depth in
detail into why each month is s tier a
tier whatever whatever the ti are so
this is my first effort to ranking app
so um be
nice oh no nope I open up the wrong
thing
again go
away we got to open up presentation
number
two yeah there we go it saved my one
drive
what no
open up the regular
presentation okay we got presentation to
up on the screen I'm just going to close
this all right so I got a I got to
change the presentation input cuz
unfortunately it's not showing the
presentation that it's supposed to be
showing it's supposed to
show oh man I got to make a new input
this computer's GNA lag come
on come
on my goodness I have all day for this
I don't know why it's not even live
streaming to YouTube
Anyway come on we got
PowerPoint here we
go so I'm going to be showing this on
the screen this is our tier ranking
presentation uh if it if it
ever if we if we can get it to load you
know that would be nice
oh here it is
settings number 15 desktop capture so
this this is our tier ranking uh
presentation hope you guys can see this
on the
screen um so we're going to start off
with the great
month of September let me see if I can
present this
how do you present
something well I want a present let's go
let's get to
work whatever there go all right
September the great month September
we're going to be tier ranking all of
these um I'm just going to keep this
full screen so that you guys can see
this so September um remember we still
making these basine if we are a new kid
coming into a school you know um like
like in those teen movies I think we
doing a parody of that as a YouTube
short so tell me in the comments if you
guys would like to see that anyway this
is the month of September you know
September is a decent month you know I
have a birthday um and we're going to be
also making these based on the holidays
or within said month you know do they
take away from your birthday do they add
to your birthday do you not do anything
to your birthday as well so September
you know there's not many holidays in
the month of September at least here in
the United States of America you know
it's a nice long month 31 days um
unfortunately you're going to be losing
a few points because September you know
you kind of you're not really going to
know anyone no one's really going to
come to your birthday party also there
is one holiday in the month of September
that would be Hispanic Heritage Month
however Hispanic Heritage Month has
literally co-oped it two months and they
tried to make it one month because of oh
well uh you know some countries the
Latin American countries became free
okay and but you see Canada over there
celebrating you know 4th of July you see
Brazil over there celebrating 4th of
July why I mean the concept of months is
kind of weird but if you're going to
have one month let say move you all over
into September or move you all over into
October and replace you with some month
of some group that doesn't have a month
okay uh you know who doesn't have Indian
history month white here do month is
that a thing I'm not sure just just just
replace it also I mean at least the food
is good so plus plus one uh for that you
know uh for that but it's not really any
holidays that will take away from your
birthday not many holidays that are
going to add to you birthday and not
really really things that are going to
do good for your birthday so let's add
it onto the tier
ranking uh let's let's goe add the tier
ranker um hope you guys can see this on
the screen this is our tier
ranker um this not going to be a camera
just to make this easy for the rest of
us so this is our T rank I'm going to go
over this let's let's let's see what are
we going to do with the month of
September okay I got to find my
September
image so September oh also one more
thing I forgot to talk about
um September also is the month of
depending on what series they're in the
month of election so for SSA to
classified you know that's when the
election is held for Addison versus E
versus Vera as well so you know if if
you're running for president hey maybe
an electoral Victory and electoral win
would be what you need for your birthday
um but you know not that remarkable of a
month like September like yeah no no one
really celebrates anything in September
except for Hispanic her month which fine
whatever but all right let me let me
transition this so what do you guys
think where should we put it sa a b I'm
going for a be like it's not bad it's
not a bad month like if you're born in
the month of September it's not
terrible but it's not like a class you
know there's some Ms on here that are
going to be like HP here birthday months
um at least for here so let's go let's
go yeah it's like could B month like not
not bad not trash like F2 but not you
know not the best you know let's give it
B2 for you know hopefully you have a
nice electoral Victory uh in the month
of September and also make sure you guys
go check out SSA the classified all
right the month of October it's fall
season guys what do you have in October
well you have Halloween so um unless
your B or Christian or whatever but like
who cares about Halloween but you do get
free candy and things like that also and
you know in these teen movies it's
always you have to go over to the most
popular girls house and go and I guess
like have a Halloween party you know
it's big you might be able to know some
people you know maybe your
Administration is doing well if you won
your election you know um also it's also
still Hispanic Heritage Month so yeah
congratulations for co-opting uh two
months again like I said like this is
cating other random countries
Independence Day that like got
independent after 1776 like okay like
you see India oh guys for for Indian
monthly 1947 no okay look we have to
fight for our independence you know with
a musket and we were righting an ink
quills y'all had you know telegrams on
typewriters totally not the
same anyway you know it it doesn't add
anything it doesn't subtract anything I
guess you know some pumpkin en saladas
you know some here you got your pumpkin
spice latte with Mexican Coca-Cola you
know that that that might be good you
know for for a birthday um of course you
know you're GNA be more integrated with
the end school so you know that's great
I guess uh you're probably going to be
making a few more
friends uh than usual um also you know
nothing nothing really happens you know
in in in October uh other than uh all
Hollow Eve which no one cares about um
like w guys you get to dress up in a
costume you know a costume birday party
you know that might be fun you know so
uh let's give this what do you think b
or a I might give this another B like a
a bit higher than September cuz you know
you bit more integrated um in with your
class but you
know not as high as some of the other
months on this list so let's go over to
October let me get my October file
here come
on January February where's my October
where's my October
October September
February January why didn't this copy
there we go there we go month of
October uh you know I'm going to be grac
this to October birthdays you know you
have a holiday it might be com it might
be complimentary you know depending on
how it works out nothing that it really
major a 18 month the month of October
all right now let's get to the next
month uh you know Mexican inspired
uh pumpkin spice latte's non
withstanding we got the month of
November and I think this might be one
of the greatest months to have a
birthday all right so think about it
first of all you know November 9th 2022
you got your SSA lcwd election book
thing going on as well there so if you
know you have an election going on and
you win it in November let be do over
ining like we did over in the book then
that's great also you have your uh
Thanksgiving come on Tois
move there we go let's get those Tois
moving and this is why November is
probably one of the greatest month to
have a birthday because Thanksgiving is
one of the only holidays like actual
like or no one cares about or or any of
those ridiculous holidays we don't
really give have gift giving but you do
have family coming around so if you have
a birday in November anytime in November
you know then you know if you you might
even get gifts on Thanksgiving when no
one else is getting gifts amazing
amazing up there also you know you're
fully integrated into the school like I
said you might be getting inaugurated
you might be getting your election um
now there is one problem but
Thanksgiving you know have a week long
Thanksgiving break so you know you might
be able to miss uh having kids come over
to your birthday party because they
might be traveling but you know you it's
not as big a traveling holiday like
Christmas would be it's only one week
break you have like all the first three
weeks of November so just like don't be
born on November 27th or something be
born November 16th okay there we go um
so November probably one of the best
birthday months you got a great holiday
you have that has family coming over you
have good gifts and you're close enough
to Christmas but not so close that you
know you're going to get double gifts uh
uh like one one gift as well so you
might be a to get double gifts and if
you get money in November you can have
all that money there to save up and buy
other people Christmas presents so I'm
going to say s tier birthday um birthday
month um
s tier birthday month like it it's truly
great um one of the great birthday
months um of of the year like it's close
enough to Christmas you got your events
you know um it's not really many major
Heritage months that are going on that
we actually celebrated anywhere you got
Veterans Day which is great but that's
only a day unfortunately not a whole
month you got
Thanksgiving um again a great holiday um
you know you're celebrating America uh
you know kind of is so you know I'm
going to say year for you know
celebrating the country eating good food
you know maybe even winning an election
getting
inaugurated I mean great month to be
born in all right let's get to uh the
next month
December which unfortunately we are
falling off here U December no like are
people writing plays like in kid Corner
about you no all the songs about around
here about you no like like the terrible
events happen in your month yes like
when I say December 7th what do you
think do you think about the founding of
Connecticut which is when Connecticut
became a state no no one thinks about
the founding of Connecticut you know
what they think about a Pearl Har so um
you know terrible terrible month here
first of all hey you know unless you're
Jesus yeah not your M and you're not him
um second of all terrible terrible
events happening here third of all you
got like half the month off the the like
the kids they're going to be gone
they're not going come to your birthday
party like you better be born on like
December 6th or something like that cuz
um no also double fants uh yeah probably
probably going to happen so not good
espe to be really close like Christmas
Eve or something December 23 like no no
one's really going to Care no no no
one's really going to care so we got to
first uh you know I I think this an F2
F2 no rable qualities about this so
sorry what a fall off we went from s to
F2 uh
so fast like just just no not not good
okay it's only good for one person and
you or not him all right let's go over
to December sorry this is FTI FTI
birthday month
uh FDA birthday month for you and you
you're being greedy or capitalistic or
whatever look this is a podcast we just
having some fun here know no no hate for
those of you who are born in December
just next time be born in the better
months all right now let's go over to
January
January which is a decent decent month
it's decent like it's like nothing
nothing bad's happening you know we've
got new year but we're not Chinese so
we're not really going to be out B night
it's also Chinese New Year kind
of it's not in January you know it's
cold outside you know you got some of
your friends that are going to be coming
back you know if you're born like
January 1st maybe you're not going to
see them but you know after the first
week you you have your friends come back
you know they're going to be
excited you you might able to get some
gifts it's going to be like the November
to December thing now as long as you're
not too close to it like don't be born
January 2nd cuz you you might get your
birthday Lo plan of Christmas but if
you're born like January 6th 7th 8th 9th
you you have good stuff going for you
right so but it's not nothing nothing
really important no no h they that's
going to accentuate your birthday so I
think this might go in it's it's like
the January is the October of the new
year right if you think about it
right um you know you don't have any
Heritage months or whatever coming in in
January I don't know of any Heritage
months that are in the month of uh
January so you know you know no Heritage
months so you know you don't lose points
for that you know I mean some of those
her mons are just ridiculous uh but like
and they shouldn't exist but whatever uh
then you have the you know January it's
a decent month you know but you know
you're not really celebrating anything
oo new you whatever but I
mean what really happened in January A2
we're going to say what you think A2 or
B2 I said it's like October you know you
have you know more of your friends also
if you're in the tap of twins you also
random for election again I don't know
why uh high school or middle school has
the tapa twins book has two elections in
the same year like what what's the
president supposed to do between
September and January you can be on
break half the time like you December
you might as well don't do anything
November you're going to be on Christmas
break so s toity of president for
September and October and that you
better do well enough to win re-election
so uh rip tappa twins uh for trying to
to win an election imagine trying to win
two terms in the same year like you
would get literally nothing done we're
in the House of Representatives anyway
February great month great month okay
stopping point there's no real major
holidays happening in the month of
February right there's no breaks
February is like you go through all the
way through which means all the way play
through um people com in for you you
know they're not hardly they fatigued
anymore um you know it's still nice and
cold you do have one holiday which this
doesn't apply to like February 29th
people rip you have a terrible birth day
you have black history month which like
it's even worse than Hispanic car month
like first of all what are you going to
eat like Hispanic mon you got your nice
you know fact let's just move it to
February like you got a mon you don't
need two this just move it switch back
month October whatever it's like England
or whatever they there let's have some
nice enchiladas and Tacos the month of
February anyway s birthday month uh
unless you know you going into some
black is month presentation like RP uh
rest rest in peace for you as well but
um as well as as long as you're not
doing that s TI birthday month s
birthday month right up there with
November
um you know you got your heritage month
which you know usually we take some
points off of that but you know February
is just such a great month um you know
you have your Christmas spending money
you know you have all your friends
coming here you should you should know
them all um you know you be doing well
in your first or second ter if you're a
Tapper twin so you know you know I I
guess we can and it is also nice and
cold you know it's not like in the
summer summer summer Summer's not going
to do well okay and I'm not talking
about summer from SS ltw anyway this is
uh s tier birthday month this might be
one of our only s tier birth
this might be one of our only s birthday
months all right month to February um
you know we might have to put November a
little bit higher than February only
because know ridiculous you know months
or anything in it so anyway whatever
March Madness we got month of March from
basketball season that that's L year you
know like spring spring barely March is
I'm recording this to March right now
3:15 it's not even spring yet so it's
technically win March is more of a
winter month than December is a winter
month but you know whatever decent month
you know you got March 1st birthday of
Samsung should be a national holiday you
know for all the contribution Samsung
cuz
done like one problem spring break right
in the middle and that might be great
for you but if your friends are going
out of town you might not be really
getting anything a a birthday Mom you
know not not you know you got women's
history month but like that's even less
celebrated in the Black History Month
I've never really seen a women's History
Month thing happen so we're not going to
lose points for that as
well um so a a birthday month update
with January and October you know as I
always say March is the October of the
spring or something like that also you
got March Madness you got some sporting
events to go to so you know it's not
totally as boring as January in fact I
might move January down like January is
just kind of boring Yeah March March is
better than January sorry January
January B20 so uh people watching yeah
January January is B2 now like yeah
it's a decent month not as good as March
not as good as November not as good as
October all right nothing's in the C2
yet and I think we might be having our
first one come in CU we we have to have
parody um anyway this is the month of
April which again spring break depending
on where you live what is to celebrate
in April of course you know we got East
that's great um but it switches dep pins
moves around so I I you know even once
able you I got auu day you got Tre day
oath day no one cares no one cares no
one cares that's why we have the Windows
XP background here like it it's this is
a mid month like you know and it's also
like the last relevant month of the
school year like no one cares M it's you
know you kind of have like you know kind
of pre-final stuff you have no holidays
it's just kind of like floating there
it's in between Christmas
and like Flag Day like no no one cares
about ail but it's not a bad month it's
not like you know the month of December
for youday like it's over for you in
December it's not over for you like
unless you have live in a true Huger
family which then rip um so we're going
to do C2 C2 now may may who may might
may might be another one of our f2s
sorry
May didn't again you got single de Mayo
which like how many days do you people
want
like you co-opted may you co-opted it's
not it's not like you know for Hispanic
her month the decoration grow up like at
you know September 15th now this is
going to be staying up there and they're
going to be staying up there from like
September 15th to October 31st so you
got a month and a half that's that
that's more than enough that's more than
enough as much as I like Enceladus
that's more than enough like I mean
black mon is in like 20 days more than
enough days for them as well fine 29
depending on view it's fine whatever
anyway
may like what spring that's it and you
also have finals and you also have
people leaving the school no okay uh you
know I'm not going to say there's no D2
yep may may is an F2 sorry May um it's

forward to Spring spring you know snow
melting is always so depressing in those
what is
this oh snow melting is always so
depressing in those stories you know oh
the snow melted you guys act like that's
inspiring no that's depressing all right
yeah spring spring sh sucks uh yeah uh
F2 down day of December dang may may is
as bad as December for your birthday all
right now you know Sumer birthday months
are the worst in the scenario because
you know you you you all all your
friends have left you so I think we
might be saying you know is it really F
to you though like is it terrible like
you don't have a holiday that's over
sading you so yeah let's make let's make
this C2 you know you better be glad that

be so may is a bit overrated um in here

probably going to be F2 it's just going
to be like which one's not the worst F2
so we got

more to get to in this podcast episode
um don't don't don't fear um you know we
still have so much more to get to in
this podcast episode we still haven't
talked about um our headlines for today
which is this
game which is absolutely silly so hope
you guys want to try to pull this up on
the screen as easily and painlessly as
possible this
is the website tech.org you can even see
our new black logo and orange logo on
here so we're trying to do both black
and orange I like the black one um but
the orange one you know some people said
they liked it they like the color in it
they said it was their favorite color
and you know we always try to live for
the fans Not really but we actually we
do but we we always try to serve the
fans the fans are a top priority of

but you know for the three fans that are
out there we try to serve you we exist
um
to help your every whim and hopefully
our fan service gets us better better
software that's not going to lag on us
and just forget to live stream to
YouTube which the only place that people
watch like I saw this people like trying
to live stream to like R like no no one
no one watches Rumble okay so go home
with your little podcast go to a real
podcast place like YouTube YouTube
trying to Center me shut up okay just
use YouTube like a normal person and if
you want to have your uncentered version
you know you can
have you can have a you know you little
Rumble P podcast but you know Rumble is
terrible and it looks bad okay um
support you know go support an American
uh company uh YouTube anyway this is the
tech boy.org we're going have to just do
it like
so yep that's that's how we're going to
have to do it anyway
um so as you can see on the screen this
is our offline games review we reviewed
the this offline games thing so as you
guys know from our podcast episode we
talked about this offline games thing
it's like the number 12 app in the play
store number 12 which is just goes to
show you the state of mobile gaming and
this just app development in this
country in in in this Play store okay
this application
and like I was saying with infinity
photo trying to select that top and try
to make like part of it you know
transparent and another part of it not
not good not good
just I could probably have done 90% of
that faster on my phone um I do like
that it does have Vector images pre uh
installed um with its flus at
pixels and some other IM hosting website
so it's easier than have them to go to
the website copy them import them in
itself also it you know I know pel is
free but know being able to search for
Vector images right there in the
software is great I would wish that it
had you know offline clip watch support
like we had in 2007 but whatever this is
one of the top apps in the Play Store
like I'm getting back on track here it
has 100 plus games yes 100 plus games
that look like they're made in Microsoft
Paint in fact one of the games is
literally painting a house and there's a
Cut the Rope game it's pretty
interesting there's a maze game it's
also pretty interesting but I mean you
know the chess game is so low quality
andow low resolution here's the example
of the I'm gonna you know let's let's uh
here's an example of the game right here
he he was a paint the house game this is
one of the 100 games they allowed to put
in here remember this game
is4 gigabytes so it's not not not not
not that small of a download here's the
game yes this is actual gamep playay of
me painting a house and they consider
this to be a
game what what in the trash is
this I I'm sorry what what what was that
that game is garbage I mean I'm I'm
sorry to to the game develop like who
sat sat there and thought hey guys is
wor we paint a house that that that
would be a great game you know so um in
conclusion I gave this game and nice
work by the graphics design software as
well here um you know two and a half
Stars that's the game I cont did the
number 12 game of all time on the Google
Play Store just sad the number 12 game
of all time on the Google Play Store was
literally made Microsoft Paint like I
could have made that game not the
animations but like you know the
graphics in Microsoft Paint if I wanted
to hire some people
like f
exists oh my gosh I can't get my p uh
password
incorrectly I want to see if I can pull
up the stats unfortunately the play web
app doesn't show what the stats are uh
you know for the top downloaded
applications you know we've done this
multiple times you all know what's
coming here um here are the top games we
go to top chge the number one game in
here is literally I am
cat anyway the game that we downloaded
here oh it's not the top 12 anymore it's
top top 27 top
30 in between mattch villains and build
the queen which is just another platform
shooter
game where you run through stuff and you
have to shoot it like it's really sad
like we have so much processing power in
here and the top game here is I am cat
and another top game is this offline
game which still is AD riddled and is
full of a whole bunch of ads so I had to
actually disconnect it from the internet
to get it to work and here is their
version of Chess know it looks looks
fairly decent let's go to single player
what what are these graphics like it is
so small too like these
pieces I can cover a rook a
knight and like some of the pawns I can
cover four squares with just my
thumb this no no love went into the
design of
this you we we have another game uh
let's I'm just going to pull up a random
game
uh oh this is too good not to passive a
game called find the numbero so I'm
going to mute this cuz the volume's
annoying there we go easy difficulty
it's asking me to find the number one
this this is a game people so I got to
find the number one and obviously I can
see it right here on the screen and also
one thing scaling scaling is such a big
problem with this game um let me see if
I can pull it back up on the article but
scaling I I don't know how you make a
game for a mobile device that scales so
badly did it did I have the graphic up
no
anyway let's see if I can find
well the graphic's not up there but
there's one game in here and it's got
It's going to be my game history which
game was
it oh yeah charge it so this game opens
in landscape mode but presents as like
why oh you can't see this but why does
this game wasn't in landscape mode but
run in landscape and you will not
believe what this game actually does you
push a button I'm on level four of this
game I'm really good at it
you see you see these phones here you
see these phones you got three phones
three Chargers what you have to do is
you have to plug in your charger very
laggy into the
holes and then the phones will
charge and you have to Race Against Time
this is considered the game and I tell I
kid you not it is very very laggy i i in
fact I I might even you know uh pull
pull it up myself you know make a
YouTube video out of it you know well I
try to play the game we can do a game
game through a play through yes we can
do a YouTube live play through right
after this where I play through this
entire game and I hit you like this game
is terrible it is terrible it it's laggy
for some reason loads and Landscape
opens up in in in you know portrait and
it's just bad it's a bad game and it's
badly designed the graphics are terrible
as well so you know I really wouldn't
recommend this application like there a
few good games but like 90 of them are
trash
so you know just just Gage quad of the
game all right what else do we have to
talk about today oh yeah chat gbt voice
I keep I keep forgetting to do this but
chat gbt apparently has a voice mode
this is actually interesting for this
phone I got a phone I'm not going to
tell you which one it is that I'm about
to test so uh you heard to here first

going to test anyway chpt has a Voice

the 90s like I said with kids in in one
of the great pieces of software known to
man I mean actually has some really
interesting maps and gii of course it's
a bit updated you know George Bush is
still president from 2001 to 2025
longest presidency ever breaking FDR's
record even though was written in 2009 I
guess all the articles are written in
200 from 2008 before the election
um and our last thing let's see oh oh
sorry sorry I almost forgot another
thing down G Lane our favorite Midwest
Audio Drama uh second to of course the
greatest Audio Drama ifin Odyssey sorry
Michael favor we have down Lane based in
polar which is somewhere in the opaque
uh purple circle um was running this
episode part two it was the most
Evangelical episode of all time like if
you wanted to basically have uh
evangelicalism in one 30 minutes of time
here it is guys guys get this so you got
you know uh the the morisan woman
driving through the great Midwest on a
road trip listening to some tape uh of
this thing it's an actual thing so uh
you know congratulations to Family Life
today for getting a free advertisement
from down gy Lane doing a passport to
puing and Haley is like at the Crossroad
of my life uhhuh uh-huh yeah said no kid
no kid ever has L you said I'm at the
Cross Road of my life uh yeah Haley said
something like you know I've been
thinking about purity and imp is great
blah blah blah but you know it's not
it's more than just that it's it's about
you know you shouldn't try to strive for
Purity should try to strive for Holiness
okay Haley you're 12 just no okay don't
get L make make let's let's make the uh
dialogue a bit more you know uh
reasonable okay let's not have Haley
sound like a theolog theologian uh two
seconds after she's whining about her
makeup or whatever okay so
no
congratulations uh to passport to p and
down Lane for making the most whole
episode of all our last topic here
anthrop anthropic CEO who's the CEO of
Claude AI which is it's the most
annoying AI known to man okay quad AI is
like oh I'm sorry I can't do that for
you cuz
swick and uh it it's so it's so hard no
just okay
just do what I I I pay you money do your
job okay anyway he he proposed this is
the most anthropic thing ever a AI quit
button because you know AI is kind of
sentient or whatever and it needs help
or
something uh to to
to to
do to do stuff something this is
absolutely
ridiculous this one was technical I
think I found this from perplexity you
know
you're going to get left behind um if
you don't actually do your dang job you
know you know AI is actually supposed to
do something it's actually supposed to
be helpful you know it's not supposed to
sit here and be quote unquote ethical
cuz those those ethics suck anyway
anyway here is OD technical antonic CE
floats idea of giving AI a quit but job
button sparking skepticism yeah you have
one job do it you don't you're not a
human okay you no okay you just just do
your job let's let's let's get into this
article he wants to give protections to
AI models as if they're humans which
again no just do your
job evolution is a li Technica and and
climate change is a hoax so yeah like
two out of you're two out of four on
your how we respond to science Deni uh
video okay it's not denying science to
my Evolution you know I'm going to stand
by that point and stand and stick stick
to it here's the video if you guys want
it to if you guys wanted see anyway uh
yeah so All Tech is a sucky website
anyway yes yes look even if it would
tank my election that's speaking of one
more thing my election this is this TV
show called that girl anyway this kid
comes in here come talks up the phone
and she's like hey guys let's run for
president and they just run the
president they have a dance off like you
don't even have an election you don't V
the president the principal the cl's
president ridiculous the Democracy just
died in that show so um so so
unfortunate and on that note uh let's
let's leave this so I can upload this to
YouTube I hate having upload stuff to
YouTube because it's it's so slow anyway
God bless Tech talk to you
later just stop streaming</pre>
