<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 72024 pt 2</h1>
<pre>hello Internet and welcome to this week
in the Tech booy podcast I have lots to
talk about today so Mr the boss released
a new video talking about Nvidia um
Samsung uh onei 6.1 is coming out and
you know we got to talk more about those
features um also last week we declared
war and teenage girls you know we gotta
talk about how this war is going the
Instagram mobile application has been
going in and out so videos have not been
uploaded at the frequen see that we
should expect from an influencer of aa's
statue but
um unfortunately
the software isn't working as well as we
thought it should be oh wow we already
got a comment today hello from
ljb um welcome and thank you for tuning
in to our web stream also uh oh yes a
software update from this company called
Crow strike which is a Cloud inpoint
mobile security company um took down
every Internet connected computer
yesterday running a Windows operating
system um that had that software on it
due to a faulty software update um of
course people started blaming Microsoft
for this because Microsoft's always easy
to blame but they did not do this all
right so um let's get into
um let's get into that software update
and of course um we only had one article
published this week um on the tech
boy.org so there's nothing much to talk
about on that side but we will be
talking
about
today so here we go here's the cloud
strike
outage explained that caused the windows
blue screen of death
on multiple
computers what what does this coma say
RP Jackson what Shea Jackson Lacy had B
to our church before
Ben I who are you
[Music]
um
hello um all yeah so let's due to the
the the
video and I'll make sure the transcripts
out so that no bad words pop up on
screen neat nice to have a person here
who loves me
personally all right
so
uh let's go here's the crowd
strike oh sorry long video so this
software called Cloud um cloud cloud
strike so let me let me play the video
and turn the captions off
have stopped working airports have had
to resort to whiteboards for departure
screens even 911 call centers have been
put out of action so if you live in
Alaska best try to memorize these
numbers instead because you sure aren't
getting a response from calling 911 if
you weren't familiar with the Blue
Spring of death well you sure are now
even some giant Bill BS in Time Square
how do I not remember you I don't know
what your username is compared to real
life uh
ljb ljb
are you a kid I think I might know
you are now advertising it what the hell
is going on initially it was thought
this might be some kind of Cyber attack
then people blamed Microsoft after all
but of course Microsoft you know this
this didn't affect uh PCS that didn't
have the software so like I turned on my
computer yesterday it still work as you
can see it's turned on right
now only Windows systems seem to be
affected in reality the problem lies
with crowd strike one of the largest
cyber security companies in the world
these guys are famous for their endpoint
detection and response Services you can
think of this as a kind of antivirus
solution for companies which have whole
fleets of computers now I was look at
these fleets of computers I we got some
of the same computer lot of blue screens
here but then you have these huge like
silver laptops right there so I find
that very interesting
um yeah bu also I wonder why they
couldn't use normal an software I like
to see why why compan is using that like
say you know a
vast like software like that instead of
this like um maybe it prevents them from
getting uninstalled on like corate
computers speaking of um you know that
software feature on Windows devices they
used to be on Windows devices they might
have taken it off where you could send
messages to people over the command line
I found an application that allows you
to do that on Android
but you have to pair with devices so
it's called landbased messaging so
landbased messaging is
a it's it's a really interesting feature
because they used to have this back in
like say the 90s when there were really
wasn't you
know strong capable
internet when everybody wasn't strong
capable internet and yeah I just got
that message hello LJ I didn't know that
she went to that troops too all right
anyway uh yeah strong capable internet
with the
uh back in the 90s you know still using
dup so instead of like sending emails to
a server and then back you got emails
sent to you interc connectedly so now
there's this application called Brier um
unfortunately no iOS support because I
guess it's hard
to uh develop applications like these
for iOS that's the official explanation
so it's for Windows and Android and you
can send messages over a land so I would
really like to see um features like this
come back um things because like we
got plenty plenty of power on our in our
computers right now you know we we have
uh you know i7 16 gab of
Ram uh you know all this power and we
don't really do you know much on on
these computers I really like to see us
you know utilize our home networks more
cuz like we have lots of devices here on
the network but they're not really
networked to each out like my computer
can't access you know some other random
computer on the network which is you
know that makes
sense that that makes sense because you
wouldn't want like random kids like
hacking into the network but you know
for school Network Solutions maybe
instead of sending emails to each other
or see your teachers you can have your
own custom chat application that's built
off built off the land so you could you
know stay up and stay online as long as
you're in the building I I just really
think that' be really interesting and I
like to see more things that we can do
with computers other than say web
browsing like know in the 1960s and 70s
of course there really wasn't that much
internet back then there was you know
wnet which there was only like 12
research facilities connected to one
computer so basically a network of maybe
12 to 20 computers and then of course
you have some other radar networks for
like the United States Department
government
uh yeah where were we oh yeah so
the the the these phones I mean sorry
computers of course have to do
everything on device and I did some
research you know using internet and
chat GPT and it told me that they were
using doing weather forecasting
ballistic uh calculations all this stuff
for the Army and advanced technology I
like to really see some of that stuff
come back to our devices which are
hundreds thousands of times more
powerful than the computer that you know
landed us on the moon uh Happy what's it
55th Ann week that's today um when men
Ste foot on the moon in
1969 fun fact um you know we have all
this processing power and capability you
know i' like to see it put to good use
anyway here's here's our here's our
video what Crown strike calls their
sensor on each individual computer the
company can manage the security of all
of them from a central dashboard but
here in lies the that looks interesting
too as well let's see what we have here
on this dashboard you can see what kind
of computers you have here are mostly
Windows you know some Linux iOS Mac OS
um you can see your vulnerabilities Etc
problem overnight crowd strike pushed an
automatic update for all the PCS running
this sensor but within the code was some
kind of a bug and because the sensor
operates on the Kernel level a problem
with it has the potential not just to
crash a single process but rather to
crash the whole PC dang that is that is
that's not very good or effective of
course of course makes sense it has to
run like at such a deep level because it
you know has to scan for all these
threats that are coming into the system
so you know we wouldn't want to just get
easily uninstalled just based on random
program in their FAQ Crow strike says
their sensor is lightweight unobtrusive
there's no UI no pop-ups no reboots but
now thanks to that bug computers that
have it installed can't reboot at all
they're stuck in a Perpetual blue screen
of death Loop also interesting that some
systems that you didn't think were
connected to the internet actually are
which is why you know you should scan
what what's up publicly on show in you
know um using the correct Search terms
and tools um spe specifically like Port
5,900 uh that's the VNC Port you know
scanning lesser known ports that in like
Port 443 or Port 80 um maybe scanning
some tailet ports Etc on showan you know
you can go do web searches yeah let's
make this a showd danting right I don't
really like it when these like hacking
articles go into
detail about oh hello Thor welcome to
the stream um I don't really like when
hacking articles don't really go into
detail on well we were able to access
the computer but of course they don't
tell you how they did it so you know I'm
going to show you how to you show it in
but anyway there these computers here
that are presumably connected to the
internet which is how they got their
automatic update and cause to crash and
I think it's interesting to see that
most computers that we see like the
point of cell systems and the even the
TVs that we use in Airline terminals
while running Windows 10 and 11 which I
sometimes you normally think that since
they're only using like maybe set one
two three applications that they're
running some like some random Linux
distra or
some some like Al alternative operating
system that's not really based on
anything like they encoded it themselves
um but actually they're all windows
connected computers um right there and
now I mean
that could have the potential for
further hacks that of course anyone
could just access online which I guess
we're getting too just and since there
wasn't really much happening in Tech
news other than this today of course we
have lots of uh questions and answers
uh on stream bit of a problem that
because how can you remotely push an
update to fix a bug which was itself
introduced by an update when the
computers won't even boot to begin with
Crow strike have however published a fix
well kind of you have to boot the PC
into safe mode and delete certain files
from the system 32 driver folder but but
I mean think about
it uh so say the normal users they they
may not know how to do it of course they
might not even be able to get online to
you know check it up look it up um well
these people have a nice phones so I
guess they can check that out
but I mean imagine having to go to each
TV and reboot it and delete that file
manually and those TVs don't even have
have you know keyboards and they high up
like it just sets to say show your
flight schedule and CNN that's all
that's supposed to do well now you have
to go get someone on a ladder get a
keyboard plug in boot into safe mode you
maybe if it has a password doesn't know
the password go and get the password and
you have to go and get all those point
of sell machines all those uh kiosks
right and check out kiosks that's a lot
of updating and deleting and it' be a
lot easier if you could you know
remotely do it
true as sense for which there is no
quick fix it's what why2k was meant to
be a collective instantaneous breaking
of computer systems worldwide of course
you know planes didn't fall out the sky
due to this thing so it's not as bad as
Y2K was predicted to be some people are
seeing the funny side though Crow
strikes Wikipedia page was vandalized
but for the most part this is a complete
nightmare I mean this happened on a
Friday and who wants to be at work a
weekend dealing with this mess as you
might imagine crowd strike is paying a
hefty price for this their pre-market
stock price is down 20% 20% that's crazy
wiping $15 billion do off their market
cap their CEO was interviewed by NBC
News a few hours back and wonder how his
computer
worked you can tell it's been a long
night for him at one point he struggled
to even get his words out well when you
look at the complexity of cyber security
you're always trying to stay wait we
have a comment from someone here that's
why it's always important to have a f
anyway to fix mistakes like that I hav
never said everything man exactly
um yeah you don't want that to happen
again but of
course since they're a cyber security
company you also don't want people to be
able to just remotely reset that
software so it's a fine line that you
have to walk and even though Crouch
strike is having stock problems a
company that isn't having stock problems
is NVIDIA Nvidia according to Miss Boss
saw what was important
about gpus and now they are were the
viable company bypassing Samsung and
Apple in their weake now they are the
third most viable company in the world
This Is How
They and think about this third most
valuable company in the world more
valuable than Apple which has 50% of the
smartphone market in the United States
of America um 12% of the desktop
Computing Market here in the United
States U more valuable than uh yeah at
least at one time more valuable than
Amazon which you know
has control of the shop uh e-commerce
market and of course the web server
service Market
um and more more valuable than alphabet
which has which owns Google among of the
things which has all web traffic right
so IM more varable Apple Google
Samsung alphabet at one point in your
company system and this is just off of
making and selling gpus no phones also
some software but you know no phones no
uh no no operating system just gpus for
other people's computers 18th of June
2024 Nvidia became the most valuable
company in the world at 3.34 trillion
trillion overtook Microsoft Apple
Samsung alphabet it's hard to stress
just how big of a deal this is I mean
Pokémon you know the highest grossing
media franchise in the world this could
buy that company 36 times and that's
crazy also I don't know Pokemon was that
popular we know Nvidia you might even be
watching this video using one of their
graphics cards in your PC but we're
talking a company that overtook Apple
you know the guys who managed to sell
luxury smart phones to like a third of
the world's population you don't beat
that just with some highend PC graphics
cards so Apple sells Lux smartphones for
a dude a dude that's wild what on Earth
have a media done to a get themselves to
a position where they could even dream
of overtaking all the other big tech
companies and B actually overtake them
and one thing that I need to make super
clear which makes this all the more
surprising is that Nidia only started in
1993 which is recent enough that the guy
who is now seeing Jensen hang he was the
same guy who founded the company along
with two other guys 1993 so only 31
years old adventures and odyssey which
is having the thousandth episode in
about months and we can we can talk
about the episode um 36 times yeah
that's crazy um we could talk about
their new episode and how the tech of
odysse it's changing a little bit um in
the most recent episode with the uh
Imagination Station technology being
embedded into their talking picture
frames um which I guess we can get into
I mean it kind of relates to Nvidia I'm
pretty sure Mr Whitaker uses Nvidia for
the graphics performance of his
computers Jensen used to work as a
waiter assistant in a local Denny's Dino
when he was younger he fell in love with
computer science and So eventually went
from there to getting his dream job
working with AMD one of the leaders at
the time as a microprocessor designer
until one day when he decided I got an
idea Jensen basically realized the key
thing that was holding PCS back from
unparalleled performance which I'm
getting to so he booked a table all the
way back where it began at a Denny's
diner with these two other guys and that
is famously where they hatched the plan
to form envidia there's literally a
plaque on the wall where that meeting
happened but Nvidia it's very
interesting a very famous you need the
number from that
CEO True True didn't have its name at
this point do you know where that came
from well most of the guy files
documenting their plans about this
future company had been pretty
uncreative named next version so when
they they decided that we're actually
doing this they looked up words that
included NV in that order and they found
the Latin word Invidia which is the name
of an ancient Roman goddess Nvidia was
the personification of interesting that
they took the ey out eny a pretty
unpleasant lady with a poison tongue and
green eyes thus the name Nvidia was born
so the brand name basically means next
version Envy kind of saying that
actually sounds like a phone or a laptop
yeah HTC no not HTC Envy HP Envy you're
going to be so jealous of our next chip
and now that you know where the Green
Eye logo comes from you too will no
longer be able to see it without also
seeing this haunting image alongside it
so you're welcome and now that you know
you will see this origin all across
their branding too like the slogan for
the GeForce 8 series graphics cards was
Green With Envy and the company's
highest end gpus for a long time they
were called Titans and this Nvidia was
wow look at that
face believed by some ancient Greeks to
be the daughter of the Titan so it all
LS together but what actually made
Nvidia different what was this big idea
that they were getting together for well
in 1999 Nvidia released the GeForce 256
the first chip ever to be marketed as a
graphics Processing Unit or GPU a piece
of Hardware that could sit alongside
your CPU which at this time could only
process one calculation at a time and
take on the graphics rendering load
while you're gaming using far more
efficient parallel process right but
this is back in the '90s and that's like
all people doing you know with uh the
gpus and you know computers I was just
wondering like what what else can we do
you know we we need to get past the
point before past you know using
powerful computer just for gaming and
video editing there has to be you know
more important things now video editing
gaming is fine
right but but you know there be better
things that we can do with these things
and one of the things I heard was blendo
which blindo is a powerful program I
tried to use on my computer it crashed
it froze so maybe to get a better laptop
for that so you know that's that's good
it was designed to divide big tasks that
would previously be done very slowly
into smaller parts and then distribute
those parts amongst many many as you
know gpus and CPU at least gpus are
doing all kinds of math based
calculations I'm just wondering what
kind of calculations they're doing for
the uh thing you know Computing must
been really really interesting back in
the 90s you know the internet a thing
but you got to you know really focus on
the what can you do on device because
you know now we have to the F inet so we
do everything on like web apps and on
servers but you know if I have a laptop
like this I don't want to have to do
everything on web apps and servers and I
would like to learn you know Photoshop
but you know I can't afford it and also
this computer I don't know if it can
support the new version of Photoshop now
more process of calls which in turn
freed up people's actual CPUs to focus
on things like in-game physics the
concept of the GPU quickly caught on in
both PC and console gaming which pretty
much revolutionized gaming and very
quickly turned Nvidia into a household
name and in nid has absolutely killed it
2001 people knew about Nvidia with gpus
ever since then um fun fact actually
this is the graphics card I installed on
the first ever PC I built a very big GPU
couple of years they've come on stage
they've announced a new generation of
graphics cards and they've been so
successful at making each one a leap
above the last that they're now out
selling their traditional rival AMD you
know the company who Jensen originally
got his dream job working at to a
ridiculous extent with nvidia's first
quarter Revenue this year at $26 billion
compared to amd's well measly 5.5
billion I wish I made that kind of
measly money 5.5 billion but they didn't
get as big as they are today just by
coasting on GPU sales here's the rocket
fuel that made their growth just explode
Nvidia made a huge bet on AI in 2006
Nvidia released
2006 2006 before chat gbt before even
open AI existed right that's when
Twitter just existed right so this is
this is way back right compter compute
unified device architecture which they
could have done a better job naming for
something that's actually a bit of a
game changer it was a software platform
that allowed the developers of apps to
properly utilize the full power of
Nvidia gpus even for non-g graphics
tasks prop utilize the full power of
Nvidia gpus even for non-g graphics
tasks developers which I mean that makes
sense I wonder what this software is RGB
star
mask could take tasks that would usually
be performed one by one on the CPU
course and instead just like they've
been able to do with games on Nvidia
gpus which just makes sense because like
gaming as popular as it seems It's
probably very Niche it's nich minority
right people aren't you know going to be
going out and gaming all day long right
you you can't Coast off of these like a
n minority right blit those tasks up and
perform parallel processing using the
thousands of GPU calls they now had
access to this was a big moment for apps
it made nvidia's graphics cards the tool
for much more than just gaming they
became the gold standard for video
editors for financial modelers
cryptocurrency miners anyone who wants
what kind of software they use to
financially model to do anything with a
computer and most importantly for any
company wanting to build and train a big
powerful AI model how do you do that not
on CPUs which are doing things one step
at a time but instead by harnessing the
full power of a GPU and which GPU are
you most likely going to pick nvidias
Nvidia being the first company to unlock
the full computational power of the GPU
for the we got Microsoft Adobe math
Works which which makes uh mat lab um
war from Mathematica which makes a
pretty neat search engine that can you
know do statistics and stuff uh war from
alpha Autodesk for
CAD developer meant that their Cuda
software became the default option
developers got comfy with it it improved
very quickly and because this Cuda
programming environment was built
specifically around nvidia's graphics
chips it was super efficient it's very
similar to how efficient iPhones are
because I wonder youan Cuda like thread
of that iOS software is designed around
every fragment of the iPhone hardware
and with this by being very Forward
Thinking by working with other tech
companies on AI for literally the last
two decades Nvidia became embedded into
the very fabric of artificial
intelligence whether it's researchers
wanting to run complex simulations to
figure out what proteins could
potentially also I wonder what you know
software do using true red in these
simulations right you always hear about
how you can do all these kind of
simulations of computers but people
don't tell you like how people like I
make these with the computer Graphics
things like that but you don't really
hear how like if I go on to I've done
this a lot of times pcmag.com they tell
me what the best software is 30 of those
softwares would be browsers tour you
know maybe some communication stuff
right so the rest of it might
be some
password managers it's just a whole
bunch of stuff that works online okay
here we go best software best free
software for 20124 it's 50 of them uh
for mac and PC here we go and I'm I'm
going to go in and tell you what we have
here audacity okay great audio editing
whatever
handbrake
video
transcoder it it's fine whatever okay
pencil T TD animation it's a very simple
program
shotcut video editor
it's VC so right now right now we just
have VLC media player which is basically
an upgrade to another media player that
you can have on your computer but
whatever like most of the stuff is basic
very basic web based
Bor
easy just
whatever yeah okay and let's move in um
Discord I mean come on top 50 best abs
supp be a website that you pin on your
task one can give you some
notifications I'm sorry okay um Team
Viewer again to remotely access another
computer to do what they don't really
tell you what okay Zoom web based
whatever Adobe
Fresco um painting so so now we got some
you know some
Adobe stuff but you know you get some
adobi and some kitchen Stu that's very
bad app it's very
it's
very 2000 Des uh sexb is
a is a I don't know what it is oh well
it be useful I might want this for my
um for my SS ltw series that might be
useful but oh it looks like it's web
based so I'm not sure oh this has has an
offline mode
okay that looks normal I mean useful
Eider Google Earth Pro that's I don't
know if it still exists anymore
Instagram people another web thing U
also this this website is different than
the last one because most of it was web
Tik Tok I come
on you have a nice computer and you're
just watching Tik Tok
an image viewer which
is okay [ __ ] it's whatever in G is okay
upscale oh oh
oh I don't know I don't know that might
be useful um grammarly Li office and
then some one note stuff but
then but then you go to some other stuff
you got browsers launchers and then some
Annie malware stuff like that's that's
boring but back back to Nidia cure major
diseases or Tesla wanting to train
algorithms for their self-driving cars
Nvidia became the crutch to lenon
literally right now Tesla's nearing
completion on a supercomputer cluster at
their Texas gigafactory which is
supposed to improve Tesla's full
self-driving using I wonder how like a
full supercomputer just for self-driving
not for self-driving but to improve
self-driving technology
how and what and like what operating
system are they going to be running but
this building is huge 50,000 Nvidia gpus
and a sub to the channel would be GP
youtiful that also could have been
better and so when AI development
exploded over the last couple years with
every single person and their dog now
having access to tools like chat gbt
Gemini and more dog have ai technology
there's AI for dogs too what's running
all of that when we ask for an image of
a otic Flamingo doing rly poy on the
moon what's processing that AI request
yes Nvidia but another crazy bit of
context nvidia's Tech is also what
powers Amazon web services which is the
world's most broadly adopted web
interesting how most of the Amazon web
services are in United States um but
actually in Europe is also what powers
Amazon web service I mean of course you
know you got your stuff here in Virginia
and California in Texas where most of
the fent is going to be um because you
know LLY
you got your universities here and stuff
like that and also you know this is
easier to connect to Russia Japan you
know all the Eastern countries here you
can connect to
Europe which is the world's most broadly
ad interesting how there's none in
Canada maybe they're putting it in the
major populations Inu but you know lots
of east east coast clustering you know
California of course and Texas and then
Europe you know lots of people there and
you know in the center of Europe I guess
and then you know lots of people in
China and in India web services provider
they're the company who builds the
infrastructure for basically 30% of the
cloud-based internet so the chances are
pretty I wonder what it means by
cloud-based internet I mean if you think
about it the cloud I mean when I go on
to the website website is someone else's
computer that's what they say about the
cloud right um does he mean like cloud
services and things of that nature prob
that anytime you visit a website there
is NVIDIA Tech somewhere along the
pipeline that's bringing it to you so
that explains the first part of this
puzzle how became the S arms dealer of
the chips required for the now he was at
500,000 views when I clicked on 500,000
something now he's at 600 massive AI
industry arms race but how did they go
one step further to actually overtake
every single other tech company in June
well they decided to do a 10:1 stock
split and to find out what that is I can
just ask the ARA AI baked into the Opera
browser explain to me interesting that
mros in like a video he said he wouldn't
put sponsorships in the middle videos
but now he is but it's interesting
that's they now integrate it into the
technology
play video a 10:1 stock split in two
sentences with an example right so a 10
to1 stock split means that each existing
share of a stock is divided into 10 new
shares and then it gives an example to
say that if you owned 100 shares of a
company and they did a 10 into one stock
split you would now have a th000 shares
in your possession but the total value
of your investment is the same because
it's just that now each individual share
is worth a tenth of what it used to be
why does that matter which is
interesting it kind of like expands the
stock to like more common people matter
well it means that for new investors
Nvidia shares have just gotten 10 times
more affordable so it makes investing in
this company much more accessible at a
time where the entire world is looking
for some way to invest in AI it became a
no-brainer it was explosive as for now
and the future while Nvidia has been hit
with a pretty severe Market correction
so they back down into third most
valuable company and I like to hit be
hit with the market correct and be third
most valuable company in the world there
are some question marks around AI like
is it being overvalued in the same way
that the dotom bubble was and what do
you guys think do you think AI is
overvalued I mean I use it right and and
and I like it
um but you know so open AI you know they
have to you know find they have to make
money somehow right they have
to they have to
uh they have to make money somehow you
know Google gy L they got to make money
um and if they don't make money they
might tune the servers off or they
probably won't turn the servers off but
like downgrade development into the
technology maybe poor advertising and
people don't use it then you know those
nvidias once they wear out or maybe some
new versions come out them may not get
them anymore so I'd say maybe think
about that um for now so as I was doing
some research on computers um today I
found about this partical simulation
technology called
um what is it The Powder Toy which is on
Android and Windows um also there's this
one that I found on Android that's also
very interesting kind of similar but it
has a different feature Set uh has
people in there has ants um and also the
lava and magma kind of Acts differently
um called Palo game basically does the
same thing I also want to test out the
full capabilities of my devices and this
allows you to run physics based
simulations um based on whatever
whatever you draw so let me let me see
if I can put it up on the screen
here
uh here it is the powo toy
so we right right now we're running a
physics based simulation of this
technology okay and this also also
available on Android but um of course we
don't have the screen capture for
Android available right now so I want to
show show you how this technology Works
kind of weird that this
isn't full
screen I would like it to be full screen
let me close that out but whatever so
let me open Chrome again no okay let me
open Chrome
again and let's run this thing so one of
the simulations that I've been trying to
run is extracting oil from
a solid right some from some ice let me
see here um but if you burn through the
ice then of course the oil catches on
fire and you don't get it so here is my
ice
bubble okay let's do an ice like
volcano And Then uhoh There Goes My Life
also I need to start re reacting to
Snapchat stories Snapchat those story
things again because you guys really
really like them so um I'll be sure to
do that and then you fill it with oil
see how the oil is a particle
oh well see in the other one the oil the
ice was more powerful so it didn't
really
melt okay so um
let's rebuil the let's rebuilt the solid
here okay let let's put some more ice as
as the base
so let's put some more I Spas right so
now we have some like trapped oil inside
of
there this is like a really interesting
game uh not really game but simulation
on the
uh on Android because at least on my s
pin because the s pin can hover over
these and you can see what each of them
does as you can see on the screen also
oh we got dry
ice also
um
Android let me this just keep drawing
here and then we'll go into here and
we'll put in
some some oil so here you
go wait oil dissolve stuff
here we
go so we got our oil in here we got to
fill it up there you
go and I think I put enough ice in here
that it's freezing over itself when it
starts to
melt okay there we go and if you note in
there you can see the temperature and
the pressure of everything in there so
now I got to get through here and I'm
going to build something um a solid
here
um let's make it out of pure gold which
is really hard to melt actually um and
then let's say you want to set a fire to
here so you collect the explosive thing
here uh no not lightning
fireworks no just a normal fire you go
so I set fire through here right and
then with my solid it will go in here
and you know catch the oil which of
course you want because oil is good
right you want
that
so there you
go but if I set a fire that's too big
right if I set a fire it's too big
where's my explosives here we go then
this
happens okay I might have made the ice a
bit too thick I don't know so I might go
in for the lightning there you go
fireworks sub Z
flame oh there you go
lightning the lightning melts this which
then if it hits the
oil it should explode it should there
you go and then it starts to go away so
it's just very
interesting physics based simulations
that we have um on our
devices and looks like it uses you know
the capabilities of your
computers uh that you have all right
so we have lots more to talk about
hopefully you have some
questions
um so I was I was on
Reddit
um and I found
these uh these posts on here talking
about um pranks you can do on your
school
network um just to see what people are
doing um on their computers yeah because
the N networking is really is really
interesting
um so let's see here computer science
pranks here
all
right let's
see um
I had it on Samsung internet so let me
see can we watch the videos I just sent
you oh okay let me check my text
messages and see what the videos
are because these are really interactive
so that's that's
neat the game console unboxing
video all tell me if that's the correct
video cuz we can we can check that
out all right so right now as he's
answering the question I'm going to go
into my Samsung
internet
and yes okay all right um it's called
unboxing the ultimate oh okay okay I got
the video link let me turn the volume
down okay it's from unbox therapy every
game console in one all right let me put
it up on the
screen
um so we can we can check that out and
while while video is pulling up on my
computer I'm going back into Samsung
internet to find
my here it is so here's here are some
things that people did on school
computers so uh I'll get into that after
after we watch the video let me just
make sure the transcript uh is safe so
no no bad words pop up on
screen all
right interesting how meta is trying to
go into the AI search technology as well
so may go into the the transcript here
so I can search for password and Reep
them out okay
back to our
[Music]
ad wow Happy Birthday Marty oh no you
don't let me get
this oh thanks you're too kind I've
heard that unlimited 2% cash back the
Wells Fargo active cash credit
card this is going to be a task in all
right wow that is a big box or really
weird camera inkle I mean that's looks
like it's like six feet long all
right let's
go all right here we go in front of me I
have the origin Big O I've done wow that
also really big
Studio okay the video looks clean oh we
got a call on here hello hi
all right I'm playing the
video a video on this product this
experiment this achievement but it was
time for a new one because of course we
have new consoles and we've also got new
gaming PCs with new gpus so we had to do
it all over again and inside this crate
is the latest
generation of the Big O inside this
crate is a gaming PC a PlayStation 5 and
an Xbox series X built into
wait it's one crate full of every gaming
console that's crazy one single unit it
is considered to be by many the Holy
Grail of gaming devices it has to ship
in an absolutely aggressive
enormous container that is also very big
container from across the world I mean
no one really knows where this comes
from could be Tim Buck to for all we
know I don't
this is 500 lb
500b of
[Music]
gaming
metal very uh interesting unboxing
here also I wonder how his videos have
changed over the time because you know
phones you know in the old days used to
come with you know Chargers and head
phones you know you had something to
unbox
nowadays you won't even get a screen
detector
ah I just got
[Music]
doxed this studio is very interesting no
no windows looks like some artificial
lights in there very very uh astute not
astute like
[Music]
claustrophobic all
right so very interesting ground mounted
camera right there so you know covered
in bubble
WRA go 165 Hertz 32inch gaming monitors
is there a switch in here as well I
missed that part this is taking things
to another level completely I was
expecting to build himself oh my
goodness that's wow just a big O not an
entire setup which is going to be so
much cooler and so much more elaborate
we have all the accessories you might
want for a setup like this uh RGB
mechanical keyboard we have a RGB mouse
pad the key light a the wave panels from
Elgato and of course the
cor you got a monitor here four four
32in qh four monitors what are you going
to do with four monitors watching
security camera footage or something wow
165 HZ 32-in gaming monitors is there a
switch in here as well a Nintendo
switch here we go here we go it's
opening
up that is a big sheet of glass
ass I see water
cooling I see gpus I see a capture card
4K 60
Pro okay okay so hope be a to stream
from whatever you's
get that uh graphic has been perforated
into the side panel it's kind of like
the big bang how everything started uh
no but okay the cosmos and such except
it's the Big O the big origin origin Big
Bang
origin Cricket you should have had
cricket sound effects loading on
here how did we get
here
what let's go hi we visible getting set
to travel this summer and need a
wireless plan that'll keep you connected
on
[Music]
the all right here we
[Music]
go that is a lot of lights on the
computer I'd like to see how that I
don't know how could it impact
performance I don't know what what kind
of games would you play on here you
could play Madden you could play
what what of PC games one of those
shoter gamy thingies uh you can play
Mario Kart all all on the same thing
maybe with the keyboard I want to see
how performance takes a hit I'd also
like to see what you can what else you
can do on here like blindo video editing
hacking also how much storage is on this
thing at least two terabytes right
[Music]
this is a special moment this is a
one-of-a-kind device and that doesn't
happen all that often here on unbox
therapy like a one of one we get a lot
of cool new products but they're all
right all right he says that just wait
till you guys not just PC games that's
good because I I could name one PC game
if you uh asked me to I I have never
gamed on a PC mass produced this is not
mass produced this the only console that
I've ever really use is a Wei we
webing craftsmanship tweaking and
Engineering to make everything work
because getting this number of systems
to coexist inside of one chassis is not
an easy thing to do complications with
networking power supply wow that thing
has OWN Network in which makes sense I
mean he says has a switch Xbox
PlayStation and just a regular computer
into it that is four consoles that I'm
guessing has to be connected to there I
mean that right there is it's your own
home network right there like in the ear
2000s that that was a network now you
got your computer and people I guess
acted like that they use their computers
for foul sharing which I have never done
a day in my life like productively like
maybe I settled up to play with it for a
little bit but I have never seen
anybody wow $3,000 you have to get them
custom
order I've never seen anybody with which
$33,000 that's good price if you think
about it Xbox is what 500 00 PlayStation
is 500 the gaming PC might be a th000
1,500 and then of course oh and the
switch is 300 plus all the networking
stuff on top I mean they might be
selling these at a loss maybe like a
tiny margin of profit for them but yeah
if you were to go out and buy every
console and controller in four four TVs
only for 3,000 that's uh actually pretty
good deal um anyway what we oh yeah
Network like people pretended that they
use foul sh on their computer and
connected to the network and stuff maybe
that was just a school thing oh PS5 yeah
that's like what 500 well it used to be
500
um yeah networking all of this there
people use computers on the network or
maybe could like share internet access
or
whatever yeah and in in the mind
computer science students and labs and
schools not at home people don't do that
that is a whole network cooling
everything in there creates Heat this is
the Big O I wonder what would happen if
you just sat next to it like could you
roast some marshmallows over in all of
its
Glory my goodness gracious different
color liquid cooling or that's the
cooling that's different color so that's
not lights that's just like different
color tubes okay okay that's good that
represents each system inside of here of
course green Xbox series X Xbox okay
blue PlayStation 5 clear the streaming
PC red the gaming PC I was trying
wait wouldn't red be Nintendo why would
they have red for wait there two
different computers in there huh and to
map it out I was like where is the Xbox
because of how tiny they were able to
integrate the components by splitting
them must they must take old Xboxes or
something oh there's fluid in there okay
okay they must be taking Xbox
uh must be taking Xbox like the
motherboard out of the Xbox and taking
the case and Chassis off
um and then replacing it with just and
putting it into that caseating them
figuring out a way to stack them this is
the Xbox down here PlayStation 5 you can
see the main board there one of my
favorite things about the console
integration is the way they dealt with
networking you have an integrated switch
in here so one single ethernet cable
feeds the consoles of course we can't
forget the gaming PC which features an
RTX
390 capable of playing whatever game you
might want to throw at it in 2022 and
also liquid cooled because of course it
is because you want things to stay
chilly now it's got this custom graphic
on top of it as well which ties the
whole thing together we've also got it
on this plate on top of the power supply
and then we've got it over here Big O V3
that's right this is the third vers oh
made three of them or third version of
them version the third iteration and it
also happens to be my favorite because
it's the cleanest most integrated that I
seen up until this point now why would
you want a streaming PC well you have a
four monitor setup here so you have the
stability of a completely set PC to send
your gaming feed into via the Elgato 4K
60 Pro capture card that capture card
capable of okay okay so that means even
if your computer
crashes then you can still
play the game and I'm guessing that they
I mean still be streaming like still be
online like I'm still able to talk to
you and I'm guessing that the uh
Nintendo switch is emulated
in in software recording from your
entire variety of consoles and the
gaming PC itself and then on the front
of the device your Nintendo switch wow
they have a whole Nintendo switch right
there and I guess they are emulating the
do you know how to plug it into the TV
and then maybe map some of the buttons
like on on the
keyboard like maybe they map a button on
the keyboard to emulate
the switch
joycons been all types of solutions for
how to integrate the switch into a setup
like this it's quite a bit different
from the other consoles you can pull it
out and play from the couch so they were
able to integrate a dock into this front
chamber here all of a sudden the HDMI
output becomes available on the monitors
inside the setup you can simply reach in
lift the switch out and then you this is
a full switch not emulating it in
software so I mean they basically gave
you a computer with a literal console
attached to
it completely portable setup that you
can take with you and it's always
charged because it lives in the dock
inside of the Big O they've also done
this uh custom pass through for this red
LED light on the front now this is the
other area where you're going to spot it
Big O V3 and this has a texture to it
all these little dots and nodes
representative of the Big O
representative of origin high
performance PCS Big O sounds like a uh
supercomputer which this would be a few
years ago like in 1970 if you had all
that power man they would have just like
3D printed a nuke and it looks kind of
like an eye and you've also got the
colors getting pulled through on here as
well where you have the blue for the
PlayStation and the the red for the
gaming PC and obviously the green for
the Xbox series X and then there's a
tiny little Purple Gradient in there as
well for me this is the most integrated
solution that they've done so far it
lives up wow interesting monitor setup
like like that the idea of being the
Holy Grail of gaming kind of a dream
machine of sorts all the variety of
gaming options and gaming devices
interesting keyboard too like a scroll
over there and a another one is in one
place in one chassis and in some cases
improved in the sense that now
everything that's a good camera also
interesting that it chose to put it on
this side rather than on the top is
liquid cooled and everything can be
played from one seat and you've only got
to arrange one piece of hardware at
least one
footprint that is a lot of
uh what do they call those things
controllers
be really funny if it ran Mac OS it gets
sued I'd like to see what
[Music]
gameplay now on the back of the PC we
have our power switch for the streaming
PC as well as our IO for the gaming PC
below that including a Hardline ethernet
port that feeds all of those consoles
via integrated switch you have an HDMI
out for the switch a dedicated HDMI for
the Xbox and also for the PlayStation 5
now there's a power port so this is
basically showing the software and then
you have your capture PC which records
it location as well which is going to
feed the ethernet hub USB hub I like to
see how the performance in free them are
over this and a a traditional way of
capture so like you get a capture card
into then you get a PC and hook it up to
your PlayStation or whatever and then
you show Madden 4K switch panel the
streaming PC PSU is down at the very
bottom of the unit and the gaming PC PSU
is in that location as well our USBs for
the PS5 are up there our USBs for the
Xbox are up there headphone and mic port
for the gaming PC USB 3.1 for the gaming
PC and the streaming PC and I wonder why
they didn't just put like 30 USB a USBC
ports on there and be like and just map
them to everyone I wonder if that's
possible or if not you know that's smart
you know stay first the power button and
the reset for the gaming PC as well now
you might be wondering do I have to run
all of these systems at the same time
you don't you can run the gaming PC
individually you might not be playing
everything at once and you might not
want to create any kind of extra heat or
power consumption no the gaming PC is
still standalone it's going to operate
on its own you just boot up these other
devices as you see fit the same thing
goes for the streaming piece oh so
that's fair so like if you just want to
stream some games let's say you want to
go to Madden and then you want to go to
the PS5 Astro game and then you want to
go
to LJ name a PC game that's not on
console and then you want to go play uh
Wii Sports all at the same time like hey
can't watch me game and you play uh five
games or four games then yeah you want
to have them all on but if you want to
play just like some Madden just turn on
the Xbox actually the streaming PC
controls the liquid cooling for the
consoles so it's feeding the PlayStation
5 Xbox series X and itself okay so
here's another important aspect we have
this little remote it's a 4 by one so
also I wonder what it would look like if
you hooked it up to a TV like you know
consoles normally are and if you could
know you know how PS5 and Xbox go
basically streaming sticks you don't
know any PC games yeah I mean you do I
uh let me see let me look up everyone
talks about how good game PC is for
gaming but I I couldn't name a PC game
and I can only name like one one Xbox
game and that's Madden okay uh PC game
oh GTA according according to this
that's a PC game uh there we go let's go
to PC
Gamer um this is going to tell
us what games are uh dragon
Dogma iotic
Factor
jant Balo gate cyberpunk
2077 okay so uh that's um that's some PC
games and oh oh we got we got a chat
message here for Xbox okay he play lot
of Forza is that a racing game let me
check f o r Za
a Forza yes Forza is a racing game
as you can see on the screen here we
don't know because there's no such thing
as PC game all games or PC games well I
mean there's some games that only come
out for consoles like Madden Madden I
believe is console only the new college
football game is console only um and of
course there are some games that are
console that are PC only I've heard of
them I just don't know what they are
like I know they exist I just don't you
know see them
oh okay okay so you can be like let me
play some Forza so you click button one
for your PC oh wait you can't see the
video anymore right yeah so so on this
remote you can click button one for your
PC you know play some Forza oh no on
your Xbox sorry and then on your PC you
can go play cyberpunk 2077 and GTA
something and then on your PlayStation
you can play some uh Madden and then on
your Xbox no no wa wait Nintendo you can
play
uh Sports wi Sports PlayStation what's
it called switch Sports switch Sports if
you want to stream Xbox you'll select
that input if you want to stream from
your Nintendo switch you'll select that
input PlayStation 5 Etc so it's a quick
little way to move between those sources
even though we have independent HDMI I
wonder how good Android emulation is
because there are some games that people
like to play like smashy
Road the keyboard towels game the
uh let me go into the Play store and see
what kind of games people
have sorry Pokemon go ginin impact uh
Monopoly go a
Township meta domination Rampage
maang solidale classic game
so people may want to play those games
on their PC and of course you need
Android emulation for that so I like to
see uh what that is uh I can show you a
great video that oh sure send it over
and after this we'll talk more about the
Reddit thing and then we'll talk about
show in which um obviously I know more
about but will you accept videos of cars
cars great yeah MK BD has a great car
channel uh I forgot oh Auto Focus I
forgot what his car channel is called
but he has a great car Channel
especially when he talks about you know
the PO star and the the Tesla and it
shows off interesting he says he shoots
all on mobile devices so it shows
interesting how mobile videos you know
progressing from say 2022 to
2024 our monitors this will determine
what's going into your streaming
software so let's do a spec check real
quick the chassis first of all that this
is built into and this is one of the
amazing parts for me this is a chassis
UK can buy and do your own config in
it's a 1000d it's a huge case but so it
probably needs all that space for you
know heat manage mean let's let's speed
them up go to 125 because we we got lots
lots lots to get through today many
people already choose this case to build
out their gaming PC I wanted to build a
PC last year but of course I didn't have
$500 a lot of space to work to do some
type of water cooling and so forth have
you ever built a PC or do you just have
a console can see how how large it is
because in in this implementation they
were able to fit in all this extra
Hardware as well now corsair's IQ system
controls all of the RGB lighting and
configuration the chip that's being
liquid cooled here is an AMD R got a new
video in got a new video in let me check
what what it is okay Cadillac all right
we will watch that video next after we
finish up this uh the the console video
so of course fans 950 950x that's a 16
Cor
at 3.4 GHz 16 cores um for context I
think my phone and my computer is 8 core
boosting up to 4.9 GHz the motherboard
that everything is connected to the Rog
Crosshair 8 hero Wi-Fi 128 gigs of
Corsair Dominator Platinum the GPU is
Hydrox cooled that's an Nvidia 24gb
GeForce RTX 390 the OS Drive 2 TB mp600
core Gen 4 storage 4 TB mp600 cor gen 4
and the power supply
ax1600i titanium from Corsair oh how
about this the game consoles actually
have extra storage added to them as well
wow extra storage added to the 500
gigabyt is on the Xbox I believe and 500
on the PlayStation also please getting
back to this idea of not just plopping
them in there but actually improving
their capabilities and cooling the
PlayStation 5 has a 1tb primary drive
and then a 1tb Corsair mp600 secondary
Drive I apologize for bumping you now
let's talk about the spec on the
streaming PC cuz it's no slouch either
ryzen 7 Pro 5750g 16 core 3.8 GHz with a
16 core oh okay we got another video
coming in we got another video coming a
TV and a
PC oh looks like a smart TV that's
curved okay 4.6 gz we we'll go we'll get
through here so we can get through all
the videos that you're sending me
um let's let's get to the game play
that's what I want to see wow wow is
going to be it signal alongside his
webcam feed to his streaming software
now since this isn't entirely capable as
you can see here we got uh let me zoom
in a little bit I think this is the
PlayStation interface I don't know what
Xbox interface looks like streaming
setup we have elgato's streaming mic
elgato's streaming webcam we've even got
some lights and these are Wi-Fi
configurable lights key Wi-Fi
configurable lights wow wow light air
from Elgato it's all purpose built for
the capability of streaming and and even
the stream deck which Wily do already
loves let me see what we have over here
oh yeah this looks like an Xbox I've
never used one but this looks like
Microsoft Windows
10es uh software right there and of
course up here you got Windows 10 so you
can stream to all your friends here so
that is that is very interesting we use
it over there on the Lou later set and
you can see the way we have custom
configured keys for all types of things
you would want to launch quickly while
attempting to do a live stream and then
of course you got to sit somewhere when
you're playing the ultimate got some
like Rand
blue chair right here blue chair all
right set up the origin
supp design a training program so that I
can run a
[Music]
marathon are you driving way less than
you used to do you have a clean driving
record are you over 25 do you not I
would you say
Supple he nodded the saber RGB Pro that
that is a very interesting setup Pew
then we have another video to get to
we're gonna let's get to Samsung
Samsung's insane new TV
PC here we go and I mean some of these
things are more powerful than the laptop
that I'm doing this on you saw how slow
searching is and you know switching
through tabs and things of that
nature so it looks like he's gaming here
you got a gaming keyboard how long is
this 14 minutes okay
okay I've seen that monitor before that
is that monitor by itself is 14 no not
14 1,49
[Music]
and also normal Smart TVs have like you
know just like regular old processors on
there they're trying to get into gaming
as well like you know five five stick 5
TVs Roku LG they all each have their own
little app stores that have many games
on there but I like to see what uh like
since it says it's a it's an actual PC
so it's probably running Windows um
I like to
see I like to see what kind of
software games it can
run what are you
doing
well what are you doing uh just playing
some games here think you got a pretty
good setup going on it's pretty good you
got a nice uh gaming PC going on I like
the 49 in Samsung here's the thing I got
something better for you okay they got a
better model I mean this one's
good I can bring you something better
all right let's see what you got I can
bring you something better something
better something
better all right all right here's on
monitor on
monitor wow that looks heavy also you
probably shouldn't push it like
that new Samsung a oh it's the Audy AR I
saw that on the uh page uh website AR
55 55 in which would be uh for 6 inches
bigger than the
thing he's already using oh remote
control Power to navigate the display do
you have a do you have a remote for your
display right now like
this didn't think so why would you run a
remote all I like to see what this thing
can do I don't really care about what
he's unboxing I actually want to see
what he's doing like I'm I'm
[Music]
like oh he just unplugged
it and okay it's installed experience
here
want to upgrade but still paying off
your locked phone break free from
three-year device
contracts and you now have this incred I
I I'm not a gamer so I wouldn't know
about this but this kind of looks like
what they have in those like arcade
things you can look up look down I'd
also like to see how the software
um knows like plays with it because
that's a really weird aspect ratio
that's kind of like a it's more like a
phone's aspect ratio than say actual
computer so I like to see how games play
well with it I'm thinking maybe you play
like three games at the same time but of
course who plays three games at the same
time edible real estate now what can you
do with this display and as you can see
in this portrait orientation there's a
few different options okay okay they say
select a layout for watching for
multiple content sources oh okay okay so
maybe that's like watching you know you
got like CNN on the top then you
got like
ABC and then Fox like maybe just turn to
all watch like three different news
channels or something or maybe you know
you got like me and then like just three
of my videos at the same time I can set
up two screens I can set up three
screens or I can do one large with a
picture and picture now picture and
picture is kind of like yeah like like
it's used as a phone this looks like
it's a normal little smart TV like I
guess he's calling a computer but just
looks like a normal little smart TV here
let me see what you got here oh I get it
I get it it so you can pick your PC you
plug into it as your as one of the views
and you can pick the YouTube TV app
which is probably better for a device of
this size than going to like
youtube.com and then Samsung internet
browser which I don't know why anyone
use that if you have Chrome or Chrome on
your PC because it's desktop now I like
Samsung Internet on my phone if maybe if
Samsung released a good version for PC
that'd be interesting but I'm pretty
sure that the TV app is not as good as
say an
actual desktop browser like Chrome or
Firefox purpose of this demo I'm going
to do three I'll put the PC down on the
bottom here in screen one section
YouTube in screen two and I'll do
browser in screen three what you're
going to notice is that it looks like a
triple monitor set in reality it's so
much for the support uh JC for
life also how did you find the channel
by the way I just want to know
separate inputs Instead This is a smart
monitor which is using a separate
YouTube app to supply the center screen
a browser app to supply the top oh okay
okay let me see what this so so you do
get tabs you do get tabs um hopefully
the coer works with it because uh Smart
TV remotes are annoying and bad other
inputs Available to You including
AirPlay if you want to Apple related
device mirrored into one of these
sections you have Netflix and a variety
of other apps but what you can't do what
you aren't doing is putting three
separate HDMI inputs into these three
separate outputs ideally and what I
think uh Samsung maybe through an update
could hopefully do maybe through an
accessory or something could introduce
an option to have three separate HDMI
inputs this little box is essentially
three separate HDMI inputs yeah that' be
good because then you could game uh if
if I believe correctly you can have
your uh
you could have a PS and then you just
have like regular computer and maybe a
Nintendo switch you can game on three
different computers right there right um
and I'm pretty sure that would be
cheaper than buying the uh computer that
we just saw had them
all an HDMI switcher but because we have
high resolution High refresh HDMI we're
going one cable from this box back to
the monitor in this type of orientation
I'm guessing that the way most people
will use that is in a multi asking type
of scenario would have their PC down
here that you'd be doing some work you
have your YouTube going and I mean that
YouTube is bigger than my real screen so
and think about all the apps you can use
from a smart TV as well like you get
full Netflix at like I don't know what
that is 28 inches maybe um you can have
like full Netflix app not like the
netflix.com which
is restricted a little bit because it
they don't want people like screen
recording the stuff so they turn down
the quality um of course you got Disney
Plus Hulu all those TV applications and
you also have your PC application and
there so let's say you want to get some
work done you just flip the monitor
change just one HDMI input instead of
three inputs from the TV and maybe turn
on some blender or some video editings
off or whatever you want to do with your
PC audio being pumped via the the
YouTube portion you can select the audio
output honestly this this monitor is
actually doing some real compute power
just by itself and I mean you could if
you wanted to um like the Samsung Galaxy
smart monitor the M8 um actually allows
for this get work done without a PC like
you can plug in your phone you
can I mean if you really wanted to there
was this kid who was able to hack and
release the Rockstar GTA game video and
source code to the internet before you
know got
published formally announced um just by
using his hotel's Wi-Fi network
and a fire stick and then remoting into
some K server so I mean if you really
wanted to like you didn't have a PC at
all you could use the Samsung internet
browser you know go to Google Docs uh I
don't know if this has a camera but if
it doesn't just plug it in um I'm pretty
sure supports one uh plug plug it in you
can really get some work done like go
like like I was saying lot of people use
web apps everything you know F
conversion web apps web browsing um and
you can use this all you know with the
keyboard and a mouse so having to use
use like the voice
command uh what's it called wand remote
one of these screens at any given time
and this is kind of this is why I think
Samsung has given you this controller
here to quickly cycle through change
sources and oh that that's neat that's
neat instead of having to like scrolled
up a whole 55 inches you can just in the
YouTube scenario this is actually fast
forwarding through the oh that's neat
and also one of the things I'm noticing
here is that these 8K videos
he probably has faster internet than me
but these 8K videos even like I I test
these out on Best Buy you know they take
some time excuse me to to to load as
well also Samsung software is doing a
really good job of keeping everything
boxed in as well it's actually kind of
looks like using the YouTube app as
picture and picture as well but it looks
like it's just like flicking through and
it's going well so I mean there's some
serious which brings up a separate menu
wow that that looks computery and this
is no Samsung thing I mean maybe two
three people are actually going to use
this but they still have this it looks
like high sci-fi things one of the
things that could make this monitor
better at least would be to make maybe
if not the whole thing some of it
partially touchcreen you know maybe for
drawing editing stuff like that also
just for like you know drawing on that
thing I mean I mean they put everything
else in here just be useful so yeah yeah
it really it's a really interesting
monitor right here thank for sh the
video or what they call Arc dial guide
and this is going to give you access to
monitor settings it's going to allow you
to create custom sizing for different
windows it's going to oh that's
interesting because like sometimes you
know
Windows uh like
the I don't know what it's called like
they let you like Snap Windows snapping
it's it's good but I mean here you'll be
like snapping multiple windows from
multiple sources you know from the TV
from maybe a console because you have
your switcher and your PC
allow you to go home to your multi view
settings which like this is one of my
saved multiv views or to the game bar if
you're in game mode this monitor kind of
reminds me of like the whole wraparound
thing and like the blue it actually
reminds me of the Apple Vision Pro which
is actually one of the Apple products
that I actually like um like you put
them on your eyes you see around you can
like maybe snap Disney plus here sitting
back while watching movies on the moon
like it was it was really
interesting it gives you quick access
and this is basically like the monitor
version especially if you flip it right
you can maybe have a nice like little
Moon wallpaper background and then just
watch some YouTube right there in the
middle you can watch YouTube and Netflix
at the same time while you know getting
some work done right and of course you
can do that on a computer but you know
you have like either half a screen or
just have to keep switching tabs or I
can do that on my phone but of course
you know it's gonna be picture and
picture like 3 in you might be
interested in if you're playing a game
refresh performance and so forth for
this what home view is actually bigger
than again with this uh controller or
just with the standard Remote Smart TV
type of interface it's going to Showcase
that Cove is actually very tight right
there like it's kind
of smoothed and then it kind of like
bins right there but pulls a lot things
to watch as well as allow you to install
other applications TV and this may just
because it's sped up a little bit but
the TV looks uh fluid doesn't look like
it's taking time I like to see how long
it takes to
the apps CU some smart T TVs are very
very slow Netflix Prime video Disney
plus Apple TV all this stuff I would
also like to see if you can harness some
of the power of your CPU that's
obviously probably a thousand times more
powerful than the than the monitors
process if you can horn that power to
launch stuff right there I thought this
was
a edge not Edge Internet Explorer from
the is going to work independently of
your PC so this has functionality
without even having your PC running so
if you just want sit there and watch a
bunch of Netflix why have your big PC
wasting power when you can just have the
uh monitor the that actually makes sense
like you know those PCS you know draw
Power especially those big gaming PCs
play turned on on its own if I go to
ambient you can see there's also some
nice video you got your nice wallpapers
right there so yeah thanks for showing
this video okay we got one more from him
and then we got to talk about showan I'm
going to show you how to find computers
accessible over the Internet uh maybe
using telet VNC and stuff like that we
probably won't connect to them just in
case you know legal reasons or whatever
but I'm going to show you um just
exactly how to do it
because you know it's very interesting
you can even find some Android phones on
these um on online as provided that
they're connected to um an Android phone
like screen sharing client and you can
search by a city um so something I
search for Houston I found that some of
the computers in presumably Houston city
government still using Windows 98
all right um oh and then we'll get into
the Reddit um computer pranks that they
had had on school because it actually
seems really interesting some of these
kids must been like in early 2000s were
putting Halo which is a video game on
the school network and people were using
computers connected to
without having a game installed on their
computer all right but we'll get into
that we're get into that and how that
works very interesting right we got one
last video It's called oh no two two
more videos okay um well we'll space
these videos out because sometimes
people they might turn off it's called
the Cadillac
Escalade uh will make you laugh like a
10-year-old POV Drive review okay okay
let me type that right and we'll be
we'll be looking at the tech of this
Cadillac which is from uh one year ago
it's a 2023 all right all right here we
go and then we'll look at the Smart Home
Video after we show you the Showdown
video and then you might you know you
might be interested in like what what
more homes can do what kind of stuff you
can access from there right so um let me
let me type in the title and uh tell me
if how you found aite video
and hey maybe Samsung will be nice
enough to send that monitor over and if
they are of course we will we will
definitely check this out this is from
miles per oh miles per hour I thought
was saying miles Peter okay here we go
24 minute video again okay great
interesting to see long form com long
form content from this uh thing do we
have a transcript yeah we do okay all
right let's
[Music]
go all right so just looking here
looking at the tech here that's just a
dash cam all right we got a all screen
um Dash which seems to be popular in
cars nowadays um we got uh of course we
got an all
screen a touchcreen thing here
interesting that it's more part of the
dash than separate because some cars
they like to have them separate and more
squarish this is more more round like
kind of looks like a train a little
bit um so I I find that to be
interesting as well um also the
tech oh you can't see oh thanks there
you go um I always forget to do that all
right um yeah so as you can see it's 76
degrees outside to have a digital dash
digital speedometer um that's
interesting because
um cars seem to be moving towards that
nowadays um at these expensive cars like
Cadillacs are very expensive and then
the screen is instead of being like two
separate pieces is actually part of the
whole dash you can look off over there
so it kind of keeps your attention you
know focused on the road and also you
don't have to calculate anything that
you don't want
to um
all right so let's get into this
video listen to that hey kill I've got
the key to that 23 Cadillac Escalade V
nice rhyming right there we are going to
take it for a drive but first let's
check it out looks on inside and outside
the distinguishing V traits up front
include this black mesh grill okay let
me see if that Grill is real cuz uh is
this electric or uh gas cuz if it's gas
obviously drill and of course you see
the you got your ultrasonic accensus
right there that um that are in the
front you know that's that's a new thing
so they used to just be in the back of
backup cameras which are required by law
to be on all cause after 2018 in the
United States of America so around the
Cadillac Crest black meshing for the
large front air
dam high gloss black for this unique
front splitter okay and for The Unique
molding around the L DRL it's
nonfunctional ventilation there by the
way this one is painted in Argent silver
fresh silver okay so if you know if this
black it be a bit hotter rained on and I
like this color but not as much as
radiant red that's a super eye-catching
color on the Escalade V true all V
models get these 22inch gunmetal gray
painted Wheels all right 22 in Wheels
okay and looks like you have um steps
that come out when you do that so let's
get in let's see what the inside looks
like
interior
uh F yeah let's see what we have here
here we go it also oh
wait I think he uh missed there we
go opening up power running boards
deploy power running board oh man I do
not like this uh feature well feature in
cars um it's like that nice like you
have eight people in this car if you had
a seat right there I'm assuming it's
three R
um it's gas all right that's good good
because electric like if you get stuck
on a on a car on if you get stuck you
can't really do anything with gas you
can do something um because I know that
GM has been transitioning to electric
stuff for a long time now so I was just
wondering
um I do not like what are they called
these captain seats those are I like
having three seats there and then two
maybe three back there because you can
have seven uh eight people in this car
but you just wasted with a useless space
right there like uh
you like maybe you have an armrest
but at least make it detachable so you
can have a whole seat right there but I
do like these big tablets I wanted to
know how well they probably get used
like now we don't really need them
because most people have phones but I
like to see what what they use for what
the
headphone if they have headphone
capabilities Bluetooth and
3.5 um also I guess it's fine because
there's no middle seat that they don't
miss out on something but still I'd
rather have a middle seat and miss out
and have no middle seat interior is
equivalent to a platinum trim so you get
semian leather seats with perforations
and quilting the second row seats are
heated you get piping on the seats and
here on the doors contrast stitching on
the leather wrapping zebra wood trim is
unique to the V model further down are
harder Plastics there's a 36 speaker AKG
sound system as standard to get into the
third row pull this tab once and again
to pop the seat forward for a very wide
access point so you can just walk on
back casually
I'll pull the seat back up so you can
see it in the furthest forward position
from the third row and then this seat is
in the furthest back position I'll move
behind this one that looks like good
um what's it called leg
room I still have knee room foot pockets
of course with the captain's chair set
up I can extend that leg all right let's
see more of the tech up front so as you
can see here um from the smudes on the
screen this is a touchscreen display um
you are different but I can send you
doesn't waste of space wait oh that's
fine that's fine if it's if it's the
same it it's
fine head does clear the
roof great how many SE back there there
are lights then you get upper air vents
me see on oh nice USBC so one of my
famous videos on YouTube was
uh a rental where I had USBC in the back
and I was sh off the USBC VOR um I do
like the inclusion of USBC in
automobiles from now but everyone
doesn't have that speci type of cable um
in their phones or devices right now I
mean c to C um from USBC to signing see
um anyway everyone doesn't have those
those
particular cables most people are stuck
on usba so I would like to see a and C
combined um I know tus Tech doesn't like
that but I like C to C and C to a also I
also like um you know normal just plug
in and charge um not a card charger like
an axle charger because card Chargers
are pitiful
um all right let's get back to the
video end paded armrest and cup holders
only thing missing from the Third Way
would be potentially another sunroof to
bring in some light oh okay you sent
over MKBHD Electric Cadillac which
electric is annoying I don't really like
electric but I do like mkb but let's um
let's let's finish out this video and
then and then we'll get some showan and
then we'll get to you a smart home
video what's it called the
apple is the Apple um smart home 100
plus homekit devices wow that's a lot of
homekit how about seat heating to get
out pull this tab once and
again in the second row pull this tab to
slide seat for and backward there's a
leather WRA grab handle to ease your
entry behind my own seat again at 6 ft
I've got loads of leg the seat Pack's in
leather the whole console here is in
leather also as you can see here the
console doesn't appear to be touchcreen
which makes sense but it does have one
two three four five six seven seven
seven or eight buttons uh right there
which can be used control I'd also like
to see if these have
um have seats seat warmers um and seat
coolers you because in some of these
cars they just put the seat warmers in
the front but they don't put them in the
back so you know it's 90° not 90° 90
degrees outside um the people in the
front you know they have nice toasty
buns but the people in the back they're
just freezing like they're cold there
climate control settings when the car is
on along with your seat heat settings
press that to reveal two Cup oh that's
that's smart because they don't have the
extra seat in the middle so you have cup
holders right there I would like to see
how the arm lymed you have to pick it up
down low are two HDMI
HDMI oh that's beautiful that means you
can um if I believe this correctly you
could plug in say a phone or maybe even
Nintendo switch I mean if you wanted to
you could technically put an Xbox on the
floor of the car um plug it into this um
like just plug it in like a wall jack
and then get your get your cables and
plug into there and then it will display
to the
that's wild so you could technically
game in that car you could that's wild
you could play video games just plug in
there and since there's two ports I
believe um well there's only one
charging Jack but if there's two you can
get you can probably get an extender you
could put maybe put a PS in there plug
it in and an Xbox plug it in or maybe
some much watch Netflix so they you
watch Netflix on the Wi-Fi of the tablet
or they just plug in the hm stick I mean
technically technically you could get a
fire stick and plug that in there and
another fire stick plug that in there
and then Hot Spot off your phone or the
car probably has Wi-Fi if you pay for it
that is wild let's see you no longer
have this car as my favorite is the 2025
Infinity has heating and cooling it say
it's Heating and Cooling okay okay yeah
some some some of the new aquir just
have heating I mean Heating and Cooling
but some of them just have heating also
plug in the Xbox in the back of my mom's
car all the time that's neat that is why
cuz I mean you can literally it's a
mobile Xbox and it's probably be even
more useful for switch for switches
because you know switches are much be
portable you plug that in just put it on
like the floor um on the cup on the cup
holders and then you just play with
those joycons pass them over you can
have um maybe you can have them
duplicate I'm not sure but you can have
what's that game see with Smash Bros
maybe you can have like one screen on
the other and one screen on on on the
same that's neat
that is so neat PS and two USCS plus an
AC outlet no drop shaft hump here so you
can easily move between these seats get
your own armrests there is that big
sunroof to bring in light upper air
vents as well and two 16-in
displays yeah second Row's got a going
on let's check out the front door Clos
noise but of course it's kind of sad
that the people you know in the back
they don't get any of that which is kind
of sad
me okay there we go like that also
notice the uh cameras on
the mated chairs speakers built right
into the
head oh my gosh that that is so
smart speakers built into the head
rest oh my goodness that is that's
insane lumbar adjustments power control
also look at the look at the stitching
in that seat um looks like it just give
you a massage right there escalate tread
plates aluminum accented foot pedals
reach in and press this to open the
tailgate okay okay it also has a kick
sensor inside find 20 and look you got
you got three back row each here and let
me zoom in yeah you don't you don't get
any TVs so the kids in the back nothing
for you nothing I mean except for this
you can charge your phone six feet of
space behind six feet wow okay um looks
like they have a phone charg Vector use
these power controls to send that row
down and these oh no those are the
uh buttons to control it okay second row
down then you're looking at 109 cubic
feet of space whoa It's like a really
big pick truck or a fan right
there there is a bit of extra storage
underneath the floor you can power some
cars that's where the uh that's where
the spare tire is so let's let's get to
the the specs specs of this car with
those buttons you canot power raise the
second row you've got to do that man
trunk City D all right here we go 0 to
60 okay ideas where we going I got one I
got
one what about a comedy
show okay where we going [ __ ] I got I
just same it twice what about a comedy
show all right here you go the Escalade
B is equipped with a launch control
system that's very easy to activate just
hit the V button in front of the gear
like that should be here on the wheel
why isn't it here they easier access
yeah it's kind of sad that have to move
your hand down like they thought of
everything in this car and then you have
to move your hand down then just hold
your foot hard on the brake while
pinning the throttle then lift your foot
off The Brak and fire out of the hole so
here go
okay what's this it's like cruise
control to
60
gosh what let me let me go back all
right that's enough to speedometer oh
yeah he's just launching the 60 mil I
hit 65 or 66 and then goes down to 60
okay listen to that okay Z 60 4.8
seconds wow that is that's good for an
SUV of that size that I mean you you can
Lally play Xbox in the back of this car
okay but now let let's talk about the
the
scariest these are the scariest showan
searches that you can do so as you guys
know
showan is this
software that you
can um
is the software that you can um use to
scan the entire internet anything that
uh anything that you can use to
um that's connected to the internet you
can find on here okay and technically I
mean you might even be able to find that
Cadillac on here if you know the correct
search because I believe that the scalac
has Wi-Fi so you can be playing
PlayStation and Xbox battles with each
of them the back of that car right now
so I'm on a website that has a list of
some of the most fascinating interesting
Showdown searches and also some Google
dork searches that where you can find
classified material um using Amazon web
services that's got pushed online for
some reason so technically it's PL in
classifi is it like it's they put it
online
um so here we go so here's some software
so here's the um here we go this search
here all right and this will tie into to
your smart home video uh LJ uh which
we'll get into next you can find
hopefully you can see here you can find
the uh the inventory of certain uh gas
stations and then if you use the city
tag you can search down to Houston of
gas stations in the city of Houston so
I'm going to search through here it's
going to force me to log in so let me
log in so I'll just make the screen big
for a little bit okay so after you log
in with your free account I use my
Google account you can use Microsoft
account or just like a normal email
password and sometimes these go on sale
for $5 a year so wait for the sales just
come on around like Thanksgiving um so
we put in your tag here and if you guys
are interested I can um share these on
my website and then you can do
city city of Houston right and you just
search here this is all for free by the
way um and of course you can even find
webcams like you know like security
cameras which is you know what they
might have here here you go you just see
that IP address right here and you can
see how much diesel fuel is in the tank
right and I believe you just click on
here and even shows you what
vulnerability is on here so attacus
let's say let's say I wanted to hack
into this gas station
which I don't know why but someone might
um attackers could use the K Linux
software and um software that can export
those run abilities and basically own
that thing and you can even see the
address right here of the uh of the gas
station that uses this uh software
that's on here so you got jeffre 05
Eastway Houston Texas so you can copy
that in find the map and you can even
see what the software shows so you can
see how much what what it's showing and
what the temperature of the gas how much
gas is left into do I mean maybe someone
can tap into the API and come up with
the way to know which gas has the
cheapest and most gas at any given time
all right and using special software it
doesn't tell me what kind of software
you can use to tap into this but it
tells you the correct Port so you can
look up what kind of software you can
use to connect to that um Port 22 I
don't know how to connect to Port 22 but
you can so you
know uh there it is
but thankfully you don't have to connect
to it right now because it tells you
what it is and it's address and the time
that it was seen online 4:51 p.m. right
now and it's 518 so this thing was seen
online about 30 minutes ago um so it's
probably still you know online right
now and I found the address from the
place right there on the map and
hopefully I can show you this on the
screen and I know this is all legal no
this this isn't even considered hacking
by the way this is just this is
basically like using Google and right
there you got your you got your location
you got your
map and you can also do this on a phone
so you can see if the prices and
everything is accurate um yeah and right
now you can see it's the Chevon
um and let's say you want to see a
street
view you just click street view right
there
boom and now you can see how much gas in
the like probably the real price they
might show the prices on there of of gas
right there and this gas station right
here is
connected to the internet and you can
see see what it's doing now that's an
interesting Soo so I go back here
um you can find electric vehicle uh
satellites ship tracking um
refrigerating plants wind turbine Farms
um things of that
nature um but here not a good Showdown
search let's say you wanted to find uh
let me showare thing so this is from
dvis is and it's called show and search
queries you can find unprotected uh VNC
and I'm not going to connect to these
computers but showan does sum of that
for so I'm not going to control the
computers but you can see uh the latest
screenshot that's on them right and
these are computers that are basically
online so it's basically like accessing
a website so you go back and do you find
command and let me showare this on the
screen this is from Japan and you can
see the Japanese keyboard and it's
running Windows 7 right there so you can
also see what what the most number of
countries are it appears that United
States of course us actually Sweden has
the most VNC hosts online unprotected
but Japan is also one of the leaders
there so that you can even search by
city so of course I live in the city of
Houston
and you can do this like this is the
kind of thing that they're doing in
um
in the blacker Chronicles Rook Ru uh
book series right where Dr blacker is
trying to tap into Mr Whitaker's AI
computer in 1989 bya dialup well now you
can this is basically like War dialing
if you seen the movie on here and you
can see you got three computers
connected in the over VNC
unprotected right the and has all these
ports open including Port 443 which
means it's actually accessible over the
Internet uh like as a website so if you
go just type the IP address into
your into your thing it actually
downloads something let me see what it
downloads it downloads a windows program
of course we're not going to run that we
don't you don't know what that goes to
but I mean that is it's actually oh it's
an SSH server okay don't actually
download anything from those things
don't run anything from those things all
right and you also got some other IP
addresses here that also download stuff
so it seems like these IP addresses
actually download things um from those
computers and you can even see what's on
their screen here you
go over
VNC and the applications called VNC
viewer you can find it in the m oft
store or online and you type that in and
you type in the correct VNC Port which
is uh th and since there's no password
connect to the computer of course don't
actually do that I'm not telling anyone
to do that I'm just showing off the
vulnerabilities in these computers but
let's say you want to find something
else instead right let's say you want to
find some security cameras right so this
is via the command line but I'm using it
over the
Internet um well of course the command
line is over to internet but um
um you can find
your
specific brand so lots of people use
webcam XP for some reason um so I'm
going to go
into enter my search bar and search
webcam XP and then do
City Houston oh make sure you put webcam
XP in in in quotation marks this we hope
you find
things uh find find in the text in the
banners of the web
page all right so you go into here oh so
it doesn't have anything here so maybe
maybe you don't want the qu Mar let me
check
okay no it's all of trial and error
right this is very interesting searching
that you can do here so maybe maybe
there know webcams and Houston right
there
so oh webcam XP needs to be lower case
okay
the XP needs to be lowercase as well
okay okay and all of this right now is
for free I think you run out of searches
sometimes but
um and some of the more advanced things
like longitude and ltitude you need
things for that as well uh you need to
pay for that as well
you can also find
uh devices by operating system so you go
by OS um Windows
95 which I know Windows 95 and the 95
stands for 1995 so this is an operting
system orderer than me older than
YouTube I think it's even older than
Google okay
nothing okay so you search by OS Windows
95 um so these systems probably
shouldn't be connected to the internet
because you know easily hackable Haven't
been updated in a long time and of
course you find much because you know
there not that's not much Windows 95 out
there today no Windows 9 y wow okay
let's see XP XP is still online I
guarantee there we go so you can find
all these computers Windows
XP and let's pick United States we got
95 for 94 computers in the United States
um uh 94 Windows
XP computers in the United States that
are still connected to the
internet and this even lets you connect
to it right there so if you see that
button that means it's going to open up
in a website and uh you get these weird
I don't know if these are
passwords but you get you get something
and you can you
know check it out
yourself um and you can see what kind of
vulnerabilities they have here and of
course you can find
uh tet stuff which is a way that you can
connect to um computers so let's say
so it's basically like connecting
computers by a terminal which um which B
how they connect it to
computers
um in the old days uh basically over the
internet but it's basically emulating
how they connect to computers in the old
days before the internet right
um it's not enabled by default on
Windows
but
um some computers have them up um that's
how some BBS servers still operate
nowadays
um so yeah you can you can search for
showan and tell
that um things like that we might have a
more dedicated stream for that but now
let's get to
LJ's um stream after this after I show
you how to connect to cameras and you
can can probably use this um if you pay
for it of course to search by via
longitude and
latitude um for for like the cameras at
a specific building location so like
maybe your school your
your workpl see if the cameras are still
accessible to the
internet
okay um so here's how you connect to
webcams here so this actually allows you
to do search tags via webcam here we
go webcam no password because of course
using a password would be uh illegal to
access the computer system but if it's
no password
then then then it's fine because uh
you're just connecting to like another
webcam so sometimes you can find Zoo
webcams houses locations such as
that and most of the webcams
unfortunately
um protected by simple passwords like
admin and just password um like they
come in manual that's how you you know
set them up so that you know people know
how to log into them but they're
expected to you know share them not
share them change them later on like
here's one from Microsoft let me access
to
it this is in
Spanish u i just an HTTP file I mean
HTML file
um okay so let me see how I can find
webcam and the these are the type of
cameras to like you know protect houses
and stuff like
that all right and after we get to our
show up after we get to our video we're
going to talk about um all the RIT stuff
and then we will be done
oh great there is a actually a subreddit
called controllable webcams right here
so hopefully you guys can see this you
log in register and of course other
websites that do this for you as well
like s siiz and zoomi stuff like
that what is suit so you just search
server I'm calling webcam so I'm going
to go into here and really nice be
flying on the computer
today okay nothing
the
space I let see if it pulled up oh it
did yeah so here we go we got another
webcam server open right
here what is this uh
no okay
okayy
um make sure you don't click the ones
that say honey pot because these will
track your IP so let's say it's no honey
pot let's do
um let's do windows because Windows is
probably going to be more legitimate
than some of these other operating
systems here we go webcam set here we go
great I don't know why blew it out but
we got
um webcam of what looks to be a train
yard right there we got a backyard just
some field probably
England doesn't tell me um some
Forest a bedroom oh Russia okay so you
can find all sorts of things here the
American flag um online right here just
publicly accessible all right so let's
get into Smart Home Technology and we'll
talk about the pranks the kids pulled
well they were kids when they did this
on here so LJ we're about to do your two
of your
2024 video here and it's it's really
nice to hold a phone like
this Stefan Roo's 2024 iPhone okay
that's
smallart also let me see what battery on
my phone is I can't believe that's at
47% that's great at five instead of like
at two man must be
nice let's see what the uh battery
statistics are
saying
who this thing is going to last for
seven more hours or four hours of screen
on Wow four hours
man I can't believe it I'm finally
getting good battery life um isn't you
know off but
whatever dang 7 hours from now what's
that it's five o'clock now so that'd be
12 wow imagine lasting a whole day
dang wait wait which video is it let me
check it's the what the phone on the
side he has the same phone over here
okay we all know the
history how we supposed to wait for
turn hey guys it's time to update you on
my smart home tour for 2024 got some new
smart locks Shades some smart locks I
wonder what how how everything would
work if his internet went down but it
still work over Wi-Fi which you know
just works even if the internet's out or
doesn't go down with the internet
different automations going on and
homekit buttons plus I have a new garage
door opener it's known as the action
button on the
iPhone also got some new homekit secure
video interesting I wonder what happened
if someone stole his phone cameras light
strips and this year we even put solar
panels on the roof going to go through
all of that also I wonder if you can
connect to home kit on let me see find
home kit on showen because it' be really
funny if I could just open his garage
900 miles away uh home kit on
Showdown oh you can't even see the
video oh my
gosh that over 100 devices me I'm going
show you that action button again is
pretty cool this one is an if statement
shortcut checks if the garage is open or
not and then performs the opposite
action all right so let's go in through
the garage again if you want to learn
how to do those kinds of shortcuts
toggle automations with homekit devices
I'll link that video above and in the
description all right here in the garage
I still have my Eve water guard this has
a little like rope thing that goes down
to the floor and if it ever gets wet I
get an alert I still have the aara g2h
homekit secure video camera in here it
also acts as an aara Hub but I like
being able to see in my garage when I'm
not home still have the Maris garage
door opener which makes sense adapter
which works with pretty much any garage
door opener you might have yeah I now
have a ton of boxes because I get like
scent stuff and my switches here in the
garage I like to get scent stuff still
the trusty Mera switches they've done
really well but one of the big changes
this year is I'm tired of them switching
more and more to the Lutron Diva and
Clara switches which I heard that
they're good but
expensive second another update this
year is the Smart Lock here on the
exterior door this is the aara u00 it
works with home key fingerprint sensor
keypad and kind of has a hidden physical
key slot it's pretty good but I actually
did a whole Roundup of every home key
lock here in the US this is not exactly
my favorite anymore I'll show you that
when we get to the rear patio coming
inside you'll see that light actually
turned on as I opened the door that's
because of one of my home automations
this was one of the new Lutron D.A
dimmers that I switched out this was a
belcon switch now it's Lutron and I have
a contact sensor at the bottom of the
door that's actually the accara contact
sensor whenever this door opens it turns
on the light and then this light will
turn off a few minutes later that Star
Wars puzzle that was a 2000piece puzzle
we did last Christmas so I'll come back
to my home theater setup which has
remain pretty much the same but Houston
syn box gradient light strip things like
that now here interesting it's kind of a
small TV for a home theater my kids room
I have some Nano hexo lights here behind
my son's desk and the switches here are
still light and ceiling fan switches
from Lutron they've been super solid
another change in this room is around
the holidays we do some lights and these
holiday lights are going into some smart
plugs that's a Mera smart plug down
there got a weimo around the other side
and we do have nice Christmas lights
smart Christmas lights new addition to
the family this year it's actually a
snake but I do have an aara E1 camera
over there which gives us a little snake
view did a whole dedicated review on
that camera I'll put the link down in
the description neat also hopefully the
cameras are you know secured so that he
doesn't do what we did to other people's
cameras unless of course he wants that
then fine whatever all right coming back
out to the living room we'll go into my
studio in just a second I got this all
right nice uh robot tidbit little screen
here which is kind of cool you can have
different pieces of information on it
like the moon phase and you can oh I to
check that out tidbit I thought he was
calling it a tidbit not that's what it's
called
on Windows one of the things I don't
like as you guys know is minimalism
techn minimist technology because they
sell you objectively junk tell you each
junk for a
reason and sell it as a feature like
think about the Light phone and
hopefully that tidbit doesn't sell
itself as a minimalist display yep it is
it says see what matters spend less time
checking your phone
and and more
more
more
time good
grief hopefully your display is not that
bad oh my goodness I mean this thing
looks like a uh a tiny display from uh
the
1980s like it's the scoreboard all you
can see GitHub quotes stocks weather
crypto train and stuff like that but the
problem with this is the
technology in here it is objectively
worse than just like a mini tablet right
and since it's always going to be
plugged in yeah it's OB to be worse and
you can always have something to plug in
right there right hope not selling it
for a little for a lot of
money hopefully not selling it for a lot
of
money um because that'
be annoying to
me um
I would be very annoyed by that um yeah
so let's see what this thing can do
especially since like you have to set up
of your phone stuff and the display is
objectively worse like you might think
it's a neat Factor but BR you spell
Minnesota in the end is barely legible
okay
um here you
go I don't know how about the price is I
I I should probably asking for a review
unit
okay
um I'm just need to
uh for
go I just really don't like minimalist
technology in that like because it's
like they're selling objectively bad
stuff
for
profit and then they're trying to sell
it to you
extra like I mean that that is a
greatest game of all time
interesting that he has two of them and
not you know one
combined wow that's neat it kind of
reminds me of the um what is it the
rabbit R1 like the screen and then you
have the like the weird portrait screen
and then you have this
bezel that looks interesting but very
slow like I'd rather use my phone to
control music like why would I want to
get up
from off the couch come touch that
tablet let I mean look at the loading
times on this thing look he touches
it wait you
can't oh no people are saying that they
cannot hear or see okay okay um Let me
let me
check Oh you mean the screen sorry okay
so as you can see on the
screen all the Sonos devices throughout
the house so my Sonos bed let me let me
rewind I found really useful is actually
for music it can control all the
sones the house so my Sonos bedroom
living room have Sonos moves out on the
patio and a pair of onls I mean it just
be smarted just use your phone app
that's actually my favorite part of the
smart panel and one update on the
brilliant panel I didn't know this
before but if you go to the music and
you have Sono speakers connected you can
actually group them together here in the
brilliant panel so I've actually grouped
all the speakers out on my ptio together
and then I can play to them here with a
brilliant panel on the other side of
this wall is my EOB thermost we put home
device technology that we're going to
have to get into um next and then we'll
talk about the more Reddit stuff later
cuz apparently I have to go</pre>
