<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 1624 The Future Of TheTechBoy Media</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to the this
week in the tech boy podcast and a very
Happy New Year to you all this is the
first episode of the Year hello and
welcome to the tech boy This Week in
Tech
[Music]
podcast
all right hello everybody Welcome to the
disc week in the Tech booy podcast let
me uh showare this
online and then we'll get right into it
as I saying um we got today the Texans
are playing and obviously going to win
today we have plenty of tech headline to
get into so probably like a on Hour
podcast stream so just pull it up online
so we have all the time as much time as
we can
get
I'm going to debate on if children's
church is a real thing right now one of
the rer debates I've ever been in you
know
because for like all my life up Co I was
in it therefore I I kind of know it
exists because I was there anyway um
I'm still in it now anyway I'm going to
share this podcast online see
here all right so yeah Tech boy had
produced two articles this week um we
had there we go we had a um let me
showare this on screen we
had the Leela AI review and we oh wow
two viewers already come on come in and
comment so you can enter all your
questions um we have the Leela AI review
and we also reviewed
um uh fishing software yeah using WSL
and 3D spe without in so hopefully that
was a popular article to start off the
new year for you guys so Lea AI is an AI
application that um retails for $15
$14.99 if you want to be precise on the
Google Play Store I was given the
application for free in exchange for
this
review and and yeah it's a pretty decent
app I mean it does what it says it will
do hope it's insanely slow now one thing
I forgot to mention in here is that you
can make your own personality in here
but I just tested out the normal thing
and it's slow even for a high-end phone
like mine so if you want to test that
out there it is and of course how to
fishen in it's really easy I like this
tool and it legitimately works I tricked
it on someone
who it was legal right and um also some
other people um it it works
and I've tried to make as you guys know
for cyber security articles they make
them so hard to understand they always
expect everything you to know everything
so I I helped everyone figure out how to
use it here's imag here of all the
software that you can fish you can fish
Facebook Instagram Google Microsoft
Netflix PayPal Steam X Twitter Tik Tok
Discord uh deviant H twitch Spotify
Reddit Adobe so like those big names
unfortunately you can't fish for Apple
of these with this software
so so there's there's
that
um
yeah and of course we got to talk about
the Galaxy AI event that is coming in
soon Samsung Galaxy will be releasing uh
their phone next week on Wednesday
hopefully depending on the time that
they release it I will be able to live
loock it from my computer and you all
will be there
unfortunately it's on a Wednesday uh I
can't live stream it to you guys because
this this thing called school that I
attend and don't skip
um yeah so this get to that um yeah so I
got to go into Costco today and went
hands on the iPhone 15
Pro Max and a video will be coming about
that soon and I also found an old video
that never got uploaded it's on my phone
of my remote control robot shooting no
bullet so yeah that will also be coming
out soon both as YouTube short um I
guess we can improve our YouTube short
um game
all right so here we are on the Samsung
[Music]
website Samsung AI Galaxy AI oh okay let
see 10 a.m. Pacific time that would make
it 12
Central oh wait no they changed the date
the January 17th January 17th would make
that oh yeah 17th we make that next next
Wednesday okay okay
so it's two weeks from now January 17th
10: a.m. Pacific Time be there I will
probably be there live vlogging 10 a.m.
Pacific Time 12:00 a.m. Central I think
10
a.m. yeah it's 12:00 p.m. central
Time uh yeah so I'll be able to live
Vlog some of it yeah I'll be able to
live vog some of be coming in for the
Galaxy
s24 series and you know what that means
you know what that means it means that I
will be able to
probably get s23 and review it because
it'll be cheaper on eBay or maybe I'll
get an omz C or Flippers Z flip looks
really nice in my opinion what's this
image here now look at this here said
zoom Galaxy AI is coming now I'm am a
bit nervous about this because I read
some report saying that the Galaxy s24
Ultra may not have a 10 times Optical
and Camera now if that is true that mean
and we only have five and three times
optical zoom camera which would you know
have the zoom so hopefully Samsung's not
trying to go to pixel rout and say zoom
in like that 100 times with
AI
So speaking of Samsung I also got to go
handson at Costco with the Galaxy Tab S9
Fe and it felt really fast even though
my phone's probably faster that that S9
f plus was Snappy um they didn't have
the Spen on hand like where I could use
it but like I was able to flip around do
it you know swipe up open apps and a
little bit and stuff I did that on the
iPad you know those
little um videos yeah that was that was
fun but yeah last night f t night F he
felt kind of
slick so yeah I mean if you guys are
looking for a tablet I don't know since
you get tablet I mean we can get into
that about the guy tab S9 FN we haven't
had that many viewers come in and you
know talk to us recently so we haven't
been able
to talk back to you and have a
open-ended stream um and we we we like
that all right so here's the GXT S9
series Galaxy Tab SE e S9 Fe plus great
name in convention from samung
honestly um one of the
best all right here it
is and yeah it's a nice little T let see
what kind of specs we have
here offers and I'll tell you if you
should buy
it so the Galaxy Tab S9 Fe plus features
a 12.4 in scare so that's pretty good
that's actually almost as big as my
screen here this is a 13.3 in screen and
this is 12.4 so about an inch
smaller the bezels are probably a
bit smaller but it is smoo than my
screen at 90 H it's probably right felt
so smooth I don't know what settings it
was turned on it just felt the software
felt really Snappy running Android now
it is running an xnos chip but it does
have Micro SD card slot unlike the
phones so that's nice and it did have
Luma Fusion I was thinking maybe I could
use as like a little teleprompter for
the kids I film videos with at the
school and then just edit their on
tablet because it' be like a bigger
screen you know I like doing stuff on my
phone even though this looks insanely
productive right here mean you got
Google meet you got uh a PowerPoint and
then you have notes here but they always
make that look so easy in my opinion you
could do all this on a phone I did all
that on a phone I mean I um was taking
like some
random
Health State Geography
yeah geography yeah State geography
class of
course class it's just like one of super
accelerated classes you can take like
two days and that was in the period when
I was doing everything on my phone and
locking it into deck so yeah I was on a
video call Via zoom and then had my
browser open on Samsung internet and
also had a um of the you know more
interesting stuff like websites and
YouTube streams up because you know it's
past the class I actually to pay
attention like recommending that I'm
just saying that it's not like a steady
study class you just have to sit there
answer question and quizes I got like TP
on all the goots and
stuff so yeah you can do this do all
this on a phone so you know it's not
special um of course my phone was
plugged into a monitor does have 5G
connectivity which know good for being
on to go and then battery how big is
this
battery okay draw a I mean to make
drawing Look So Easy on these tablets I
mean what is this in
word I mean I make tablets look so smart
like in in some TV shows like some of
the kids were carrying tablets around
and tablets are just tablets are nice oh
what's good notes oh good not is that
new app this is not W oh okay okay that
makes
sense that's beautiful no pay money for
it heck no um all right so find the
Galaxy Tab for
you it's still sending the Galaxy Tab S6
light
[Music]
dang okay so who expects for our galaxy
tab S7 Fe plus all right so what has
LCD that's have 7 FP has a 50 H
display that's weird that's probably a
mistake I doubt that the x is like you
know this does a 90 HZ LCD that's smart
it's water resistant it's xn 1380 the
chip might be a bit weak 10,000 M
battery is good and of course expandable
storage Xin expansion and Wi-Fi 6 no 5G
so the tab S7 Fe is more
connected and I guess we could do a chip
comparison of the xn 1980 vers the
[Music]
750g
that look like it be an interesting
tablet comparison tab S7 Fe versus Tab
S9 Fe plus like do you want the bigger
screen or do you want the better
performance and 5G connectivity so here
you go here's the Snapdragon oh man it's
tring it the exos is actually faster but
this does support 5G I don't know why
they're selling selling the price on
Amazon it's not like you can buy an xnos
processor stick it into a computer okay
so the xos 38 is 15% faster and it's
smaller
okay and
this has more RAM fast uploads so yeah
the the this chip is getting Tred by
Samsung yeah Samsung is TR it's own
Samsung here but I guess if you want 5G
yeah so 1380 it's not look like it's
just LS now I'm doubt that it's 50 just
play so I mean honestly say chap 9 F of
S7 FP unless you want the 5G
connectivity and maybe a lower price
because they it's older and they have a
smaller storage
in however both of them do support Wi-Fi
6 e so that's good
so yeah Samsung's been doing pretty
pretty well speaking of doing pretty
well let's see the stats for check
booy here our first statistics of the
Year let's see how well we are doing um
I want to see if we got on Google
Trends first Google Trends is that
website that we showed at the beginning
of last year where we were comparing
like the LG v40 versus the iPhone 4 and
showing how the iPhone 4 has had a lot
more search than was trending a lot more
even in
2020 doing oh yeah the Steelers are
trending right now CU
game oh I typed in Texans oh my gosh
which they better win they're gone away
obviously okay I need to type in the
tech
boy so let
me okay here you go
I hav left dat yet okay so this is our
new goal for 2024 our new goal is to
appear on Google
Trend list wait maybe we put some spaces
in Yeah by
2025 no okay
we showed up from
Texas all right let's go
Texas with zero clicks but at least we
showed up joining 5th January 6th
speaking of January 6th we launched a
website on January 6th as you guys
remember last last year January 6 uh I
think that might have been a
Friday we watched we launched CC that
little like Bon B spinoff so yeah that's
doing pretty well but let's uh check our
sweet Trix account see if we're doing
well I'm nervous about seeing this I
know you guys are nervous as well oh
look the EU how
helpful okay let me see I'm going to see
this all you oh no we're down 9.8%
but oh oh in the last seven days we have
had this is hour by hour why this buy
hour by
hour in the last day
we four minutes 55 seconds I can't
believe it yeah 45 unique views in the
last day okay that's pretty good now
what about over the past three months
have you been trending up
okay so we had a pretty good November
decent December
[Music]
and we have a okay yeah so probably
going to hit like
1,2 one 1,300 visitors um over past
three months we have
5,500 uh page
views and a minute and 22 seconds
duration all right so our top countries
basically of how far can you
go our
top our top countries of the year and
the year starts in July with our peak of
2078 oh yeah that was a peak that was a
peak month I mean we we got 100 viewers
in the same day but that was amazing
thank you to all the viewers that day
yeah so in half a year we've collected
about 10,000
viewers 12,000 page views and an average
of a one minute and 22 seconds page
duration we only had one month we
couldn't crack 1,000 and seems like
we're going to be on crack to OnTrack to
crack over 12,000 views this year I mean
we probably cracked over 12,000 views
last year too just the software wasn't
installed until June
oh this makes sense the summer months
having the most views because that's
when I have to Contin okay um our top
article of the year was of course the
lovely Samsung Galaxy m versus M7
article and of course we got to do some
evangelizing with uh can you install you
version we got the AI breaking
through pay walls are first ever uh
reporting and in cyber security Ro and
then ccpu and GPU speeds how to download
Instagram Samsung notes Google analytics
and our top operating system with a
whopping
31.7% of the count was and Google's
Android congratulations and the number
two operating system with basically the
same
percentage was Microsoft Windows with
3.3 views
31.360802 why is it not scrunch of Linux
I don't care open BSD W someone watch us
on kyos and
Tyson Tyson phone or Tyson
TV um all right and then of course the
top search engine was the best search
engine no one can stop them for now okay
no one wants to use
little look your searching sucks number
one google.com number two bing.com
probably all AI ready it

YouTube
Twitter where did they
go there a Twitter link to my oh sorry X
to my uh website Instagram so we've been
doing well D laabs Quant Facebook at x
medium looks like it's just a count of
everything that we've done already so
look at all these refs I'm really
interested in seeing where Reddit took
us like how how has the traffic over
over there that's been our top search I
mean it's been it' be Google I mean it's
in third place at the Bing and Google
that's
impressive oh let me
filter so we had 4 40 unique views from
Reddit for the 95% bounce rate in a 23
Second duration wow most came in decle
so man we got to keep this Reddit up all
right how to find Instagram Canada they
came from reddit.com I wonder if they
came from my subreddit L them were
coming from desktop Mo and mobile and
then some came from tablet which I
don't all right all right let's see who
our yeah so thank you to
our loyal
listeners and let's see how our
performance went in
2023 ooh stop freaking about FC a
fouryear old article at this point not
four threey old article at this point
almost um six seconds long long we had a
page that took 44 seconds long to look
wait that's so fastest page dang however
however our slowest Pages come from uh
third world Middle Eastern country
so people in
China our website okay Le just have to
be like Serv just pinking website I mean
we don't even have a Chinese language
you can translate it but we don't have
it so people reading our website on
consoles
which I like we respect every viewer but
I've never heard of anyone reading my
website on the console if you're a
console listener come into the comments
and we'll
talk
okay uh then number two is desktop of
5.87 seconds which is pretty good okay
so we try we will get these down a
console I don't know how we're going to
fix that we will get desktop tablet and
mobile down to four seconds by the end
of year we try to make this faster well
if it's averaging then uh yeah well
we'll try to get this down to 4 seconds
now the slowest browsers were UC Browser
B box and we chat so uh we call upon the
Chinese government to fix their
technology all right Chrome and Opera
Firefox Samsung browser AVG Shaquille
browser GSA whatever the heck that is
and duck. go seem to oh wait Instagram's
faster than Chrome Tik Tock with uh
thanks if if
you we don't even have a Tik Tok but you
know anyone who reads our Tik Tok who uh
reads our website from Tik Tok thank you
and uh the the SP stay on the website
line that isn't that messaging app line
was our fastest browser last year and
our slowest page one of our SL pages I
hate Tik
Tok it seems like our fastest Pages or
the newest pages so uh yeah just
that so we average about this look like
5 seconds in August and now up at 7
seconds so maybe that's just because
more people are reading the
website wait a
second I can see who what time people
access our
websites 10:18
p.m. how can someone be accessing this
website today at 10:18 p.m. in the
United States United States is Big it's
not that big we don't spend 14 different
time
zones but you know we thank the person
who did that
um okay so maybe this is all right here
we go we are an Indian VI view of using
Android Samsung browser they read the ma
versus M7 because course they did that's
almost popular article yeah so that's
enough of that those are our goals for
the tech booy to see we're going to try
to
unleash over 100 nonv video articles
this year we record over 50 podcast
episodes this this year um and we will
crack 200 subscri 300 subscribers by
this
year and um November 9th 2024 will be
the new relaunch of the techboy media
mark your calendars for November 9th
2024 the grand relaunch we will merge
everything together become super
Corporation and we will take on the
world of tech media once and for all now
this may seem a bit off topic for you
but this
is this is a
um interesting thing that's going on
here and then I guess we can read the
review from Plugged In which plugged in
is uh funny you know I stand by focus on
the family you know good support great
supporters of them like what they're
doing with adventures and odyssey and
everything like their broadcast and
books and stuff you know I went to their
headquarters right before Co I don't so
see I'm a fan of it that's what I'm
saying uh plug in is kind of you know
interesting um of course this is an
endorsement of the movie however I saw
this I'm just going to read this to
you can you see this there we go yeah
um now and I'm just going to go a little
plugged in on you guys we're going to be
talking about this in viewer number one
if you please like to comment in here um
anyway we just got to talk about the
plot holes in this movie yeah that's
what it is
movie okay um so as you can see it's two
kids named Kendra Brett when I kiss with
a mom finding out so instead of I don't
know a obeying their parents or B
disobeying them which okay a TV show so
it doesn't really matter collect um well
I guess it kind of matters but whatever
what they do is they have drive to a
theater 20 miles
away 20 minutes away about 30 miles
where the entire School shows up and
they are tipped off and
caught like what kind of
dumb plan is that if I wanted to do
something wrong you think I'd go do it
in a place where I'd have to sneak into
have my all my friends invade into that
spot and do a sing and dance routine
where some where someone could
potentially see I mean it's a small town
they could e the P could easily find out
okay
um they they practically invaded the
theater how did the patrons in do to not
get the 12-year-old just walked in I
mean how bad is the security a kid in a
wheelchair was able to sneak into an
R-rated movie I'm sorry but that is a
terrible plot hole like how oh shoot he
dropped popcorn on the ground he's a kid
in a wheelchair how do you sneak imp
past
okay okay
okay okay the plan had multiple value
points I mean they might as well just
made an announcement on the radio okay
they might went FL to the entire to all
the parents to invite them to okay they
might got a helicopter made an
announcement of the radio and then just
write it write the names in the
sky
okay second how can one of the
antagonist and Friends be so powerful
that she controls the school but she
gets up and
leaves and then her power is gone that
means she basically a third world power
at this point she's just like popular
but people will leave her anytime she
wants which the pl which means the plot
of having him having this kid have to
shut down the
um shut down kdom Brett doesn't make
sense if everyone's following his idea
just tell them what Lu Lucy did and
everyone was turn on hook and then I
guess there be no more movie but I mean
it's a lot more realistic I mean the kid
had the popularity and the power to go
Toe to Toe with one of that most popular
kids and school who got basically taken
down um second of all these kids
here are so insecure that they're so
invested in a bunch of 12y olds like why
okay they're 12old maybe six second of
all how do Lucy obtain power and how is
he holding on to let explain okay
um yeah
so now let's get into some more
technological news for today to see
GSM and if you want to see that thing
tell me and I'll post into the links
because I would it because it absolutely
makes no
sense all right so GS is a really good
technology webs better
than. oh let's see let's talk about the
best Downing smartphones after year um
I'm pretty sure that the foldable phones
are going to be on
here oh Al so they go byy foldables oh
okay the opo finding
three had better sound in a OnePlus open
even though they're basically the same
phone
okay zold fire had a very good L score
One open had a average L score op find
in three very good
um ano magic which everyone was saying
that this looks futuristic I'm sorry but
just forget this there we go you see
that what does this remind you of this
reminds you of something like some
random TCL 20 phone that you can find on
the streets of Walmart and speaking of
TCL we finally sold our TCL phone so um
thanks to the buyer out there and yeah
just remember that the tech boy sells
Tech at affordable prices um and of
course of course if you always want to
contribute technology to us to help the
channel we'll always be open just send
us an email and we'll send you the
address where you can send us techology
to a
you oh we got to talk about YouTube I've
been ping this off like days like weeks
now but when you click on a YouTube
notification and you and you open it you
open the YouTube application right and
then you click a link on YouTube no an
ad it will open up in it's like little
YouTube internal browser and the video
disappears like I it should open up and
pop and pop picture and picture view it
makes sense why would I want to open
YouTube right click a link in the video
and the video just disappears that makes
no sense it also would driveway traffic
from creators totally
annoying wow 2200 MH bad
wait the Capt buttons are fil thing I
like how apple is adding new buttons to
their phones I wish I had like some type
of mute button on here to switch like I
say I'm G like say hostage situation I I
wouldn't want to have to like FR my
phone I kind of mute it or anything or I
can make a routine for it
like
wait
my volume been
stuck I guess I could just turn the
volume down but then if my parents
called me then the sound gone because I
have a routine for that so I should
probably fix
that so who's excited yeah so
um I think that's all we're going to do
for now God bless Tech talk to you later
go text him it's obiously going to win
today so yeah you know where to find me
online I'll be watching that game and
live
X bye and pray for nation</pre>
