uh yapping for all that time and no one
even uh and I didn't even know I was you
know talking that's that's really sad
okay let me let me

come
on thank you
hello all right yes we're up we're up
and we are live all right so happy
anniversary happy anniversary to all my
fans you've been here for for four years
four scor and seven years ago we set out
to create a great Tech blog and that we
did starting off in 2020 with Maestro Mo
July 2020 in the midst of
pandemic really really wanting a note
s20 Ultra and S Note 20 Ultra and we
started out okay we created a Blog and
now it is great it is very very great
okay we we've been syndicated on
multiple columns okay we were
on American Daily Press talking about
the ramifications of qu artificial
intelligence and how America needs to be
first and the greatest in artificial
intelligence and how we need to take the
shackles off AI um it's in fact our most
popular podcast episode was talking
about the uh woke Ai and the
antichristian anti-christian anti-
americanish uh that's in AI you can go
back and watch that um anti-creationist
of course especially in chat jbt image
generation problems in Google Gemini
um but but we've also we've also done
really really interesting things too um
so of course you know the launch of AA
Harper AA
Harper um you know we we've received
some criticism or we know we're going to
receive some criticism from some people
we were like whatever so we declared
world and teenage girls and I guess
those people by proxy um also we
received criticism for you know the sslw
series um we launched a new Social
Network um not the boy.com after so sad
so sad you can go back and watch that
episode it's like an hour after I got
kicked off of uh not to be so sad and
you know we're still nice to him you
still have all our 20 articles up about
how great they are up but anyway we will
come back and we're gonna be great um
also um we launched you know new
websites new
blogs and it all culminated with our
Shining Moment our grand moment in which
we finally got syndicated on American
Daily Press um you know we tried to get
on NTB takes almost made it but uh okay
almost made it as in I sent the email to
the
Inbox and it's still there
um we we've made great works works of
art on YouTube you know we've criticized
the idiot Snapchat kids uh well of
course they're fake but they're also
idiots um with the parody of the
national anthem the national RZ Anthem
speaking of RZ on the SS ltw series we
I'm talked about weaponizing RZ um we
talked about using it using it as a
weapon and and self-defense and naal
security and intelligence so if you're
into intellectual stimulation of the Riz
National net work check it out um you
know we have plenty of spy traces coming
up there too okay we to compare it
certain people to Ai and we've also um
we we've done plenty we've done plenty
so as you guys know never never we never
let a good controversy go to waste in
2023 winter December Christmas season
there was this calendar going around
with all these like famous people um and
people X was so mad about it it was
called calendar gate actually has his
own Wikipedia page for some reason um
and guess what did we you never never
let a good controversy go to waste that
that that's the rule here so instead of
writing a great you know passioned essay
on the Christian defense of the West
blah blah blah blah blah on NTV for
7,000 words you know doing that you know
it's called K in the gate you know what
also has K do Samsung so guess what you
use the calend the gate ooc on X and
great GL you get 400 clicks on on an
article about Samsung's calendar okay
and now there's this new gate where
people were uh adding laser eyes to
photos um to protest and guess what did
I believe in it sure whatever but people
need to know how to add the laser eyes
to the photo so guess what use the
hashtag and then we uploaded it to the
server boom we get extra clicks on the
website so that that is what we do we
always try to find the tech in
everything and which is probably not
gonna let this next controversy go to
good waste we we cannot let let this
controversy go to waste which is the
Olympics here's my statement on the
Olympics
Samsung great job guys um the Galaxy Z
flip
6 uh is now the official phone of the
Olympics and they are handing them out
to the uh
handing them out to the athletes and
what does this have to say about Samsung
and Bren Western
culture well it has nothing to say about
Western culture but it does say that the
future is foldable that's right the
future is foldable Samsung you know
usually hands out their best of the best
phones to everyone who attends the
Olympics okay I don't remember the 2012
Olympics because I was like full but no
I wasn't four six um but in 2016 Samsung
handed out the Galaxy S uh seven Edge
the best of the best phones to the
Olympic athletes in 2020 they probably
were going to hand out the s20 but you
know Co so in 2021 they handed out the
Galaxy S21 Olympic Edition but now
they're handing out the Galaxy Z flip 6
Olympic Edition right and this spells a
new era for affordable
technology
um the Olympic you know they're sending
out 17,000 phones of their best
technology to to everybody so the other
say that they believe in the hinge
technology to at least last until I
guess
2028 um they trust S21 the last and
someone some Olympic Olympian used days
until it died the pixels off the screen
so they can get this but they expecting
that people are going to enjoy the this
over the S21 and that is a bold bold
move that's that more updates yes is it
g to feel smooth and faster a little bit
Yeah because of the new chip yeah but
what they're betting on is that the
camera system isn't going to take much
of a hit S21 series had a telephoto zoom
camera this does not n does have 50
megap pixels but you're sending this out
to 17,000 Olympians all over the world
um all over the world right and no
insult to them but I doubt that Samsung
that they're GNA really go into the
settings and activate 50 megapixel or
whatever so they're trusting that the
zoom is going to be good enough they're
trusting that the hinge is gonna um hold
up enough because there in Russia China
uh North Korea okay I don't know if the
people in North Korea get the phones um
Afghanistan um Togo Mexico um Nigeria
right all these countries that I named
don't have Samsung stores okay the only
countries that have Samsung stores I
believe uh England the United
States and that's it right so you know
they're trusting that these phones are
going to are going to last them at least
a long time at
least good enough to hold up in the
Olympics at least hopefully um I don't
even know if France has wion and Samsung
so so they're trusting that these phones
are going to last a long time but also
the United States Olympic boat and all
boats of the Olympics had Galaxy s24
Ultras on a private Network private 5G
Network um from with orange and the
importance of this is
that they were live streaming um from
the boat so like a point of view from
the boat's point of view um with on a
private 5G network with the Galaxy s24
Ultra and what they have to do them was
so interesting so according to Samsung
the way that their phones work is that
their phones have to um
when they ping and if there's no
connection you know they don't they
won't constantly ping because that would
waste the battery but with this to make
sure that the phones are always
constantly live streaming it's not
jittery so it looks good for Samsung um
they modified the firware they actually
went into the phone's firware it's not
like something I could probably do they
probably have to like code the software
them so make sure that pings the 5G um
Towers every time that they need it and
they also tested out this private 5G
Network and they gave 100 gigabytes of
5G data to all the athletes which I it's
probably more than enough for the I
don't know four weeks that they'll be in
the Olympics all right but speaking of
folding phones in the Olympics so
Samsung saying hey the future is
foldable and I was I was skeptical of
that right um two years ago right more
anniversary talk two years ago you know
I was like Samsung St making thousand
pocket mirers in inov it right and
Samsung didn't listen to me they haven't
listened to me yet the the vge you know
we did cancel the vge um we did C War
teenage girls we'll see how well those
things go but Samsung that's not
listening to me yet I me I don't want
them to stop I want them to innovate on
top of here all right so I'm calling
this and you can go back four years from
now 8 year anniversary that by the 2028
Olympics and definitely by the 2032
Olympics the only B phone Samsung's
going to sell is going to be and maybe
not by 2028 2032 all right the Samsung
is going to sell is um cheap phones so
like sub $600 lot of phones phones that
you can find on the floor of Like Home
Depot and Walmart okay so obviously
those going to be B the Hing technology
is not there yet to be you know that
hinge probably cost $100 um and then
camera phones like s24 Ultra there it is
you know because you need extra space to
have a big battery and to have the zoom
camera system and then the rest of it so
the s24 and s24 plus you know it's all
going to be combined into one phone I
don't think they're gonna make a small
version of The Fold uh flip sorry and
that's going to be your regular phone
and then you're going to have
your uh folding phones like you're that
fall out into tablets it's going to
replace many tablets now a benefit of
this is actually going to make older
audio dramas like advention Odyssey and
down K Lane all episodes of those audio
dramas somewh realistic because you can
hear John Morrison and Mr whu clicking
their phones shut which now like why are
they doing that but now a four years now
everyone not everyone but most people
are gonna have these folding especially
when Apple get into the game because
then uh the teenagers gonna be wow it's
so cool so Innovative only seven years
late
um and then Apple it's goingon to sell
these things you're be like flip maybe
have some interesting software for it or
whatever and then you know people are
going to be using these flipping phones
all the time right but speaking of audio
dramas we have so much to talk about
focus on the family God bless focus on
the family um they released an episode
on advention Odyssey a new one about uh
Jay Smouse called the smous show and
there is lots lots lots lots to talk
about to get into with that episode let
me make some my audio levels are still
up yes they are okay there's so much to
talk about in that episode okay first of
all Jay Mouse uh has a crush on Z grant
for some weird reason whatever and Z
Grant's in a meeting with this person
who's really enthusiastic about the news
let's go and
uh he's talking about the geopolitical
and economic ramifications that mustard
packets are going to have on on on the
school's economy sounds like something I
would say in fact uh we're gonna get
we're GNA get there about the time I
propose making a stock market uh in uh
the SS LW book series um which I guess
in the book series we can make a real
stock market didn't actually happen we
didn't have
enough time people people care about
anyway so he comes in here and se's in
the meeting and she's like E I don't
really want to do the story but
whatever um so trying to pick a new
story and Jay Smiles he bust in he's
like happy anniversary not to us but to
um so we gr and
um and she's like what and then she's
like oh it's it's it's our anniversary
it's our anniversary uh first time I saw
you eating pizza something like that and
and he brings it flowers and balloons he
makes all this noise and has all this
hoopla and zo Grant to her credit
doesn't just sit there take it okay she
nukes him into like the next day and she
starts yelling at him she says that we
ar Fringe and then leaves the room says
she has work to do and Jay leaves I tell
you I do declare if Zoe Grant no if not
if someone some girl did that to me
let's say Jayla Smouse um did that to me
she would be nuked into the next
Olympics you wouldn't be hearing her
from her ever again okay I would have
graduated by the time you hear from her
next if if something like that ever ever
happened to me uhuh uhuh that's not
happening not happening okay um just
yeah so honestly zo was Zoe was under
control because I would have nuked that
kid into the next
uh into the next centc okay um
but then Mr Whitaker you know talks to
Jay he's like I have this uh uh room of
consequence adventure for you uh they
help you work out your
friendships okay let me tell you this
let me tell you this the world of
Odyssey is different from the real world
or my programming abilities are just
trash okay it's either one of those two
things which I guess we can say that my
programming abilities are trash because
uh yeah no that doesn't work okay okay
software there's there's no app that can
do that okay the software is not going
to fix your friendships I think or fix
just kind of like reverts anyway he gets
zo to go in there somehow so you know
there's some problem that does because
you can go check when we readit post
right we made an app it kind of nuked
okay we're gonna go that into the SS ltw
series but yeah that doesn't work so
yeah no so any kids out there who
thinking about building a room of
consequence to to simulate friendships I
said know if you have the technology to
do that maybe you could do it because
maybe works in the room of consequence
you know that's 20 T level
technology but 1980s spread sheets I
guess they don't work all right
um
anyway whatever the world of Odyssey is
different and also kind of wonder about
the data privacy laws of wit in
cuz he has like voice samples of all the
kids in the room of
consequence which of course you can
replicate with AI cloning technology
which heaven forbid I ever make a AI
program to help me with friendships
because uh yeah it doesn't work and the
last time I cloned someone's voice they
didn't like it so whatever maybe it's
just the Mr wi effect who knows um
anyway
uh these they go in whatever and he
figures out the thing which is you have
to be a good friend and stop you know
busting in meetings
and screaming heavy anniversary yet
Sor um anyway that's what I have to say
about event episode also the Avent
episodes both of them have been in
Virtual simulation there was the first
one was in the gallery the second one
was in the room of consequence so
very interesting also event odyy episode
1000 is coming up you know know that's
going to be a family-friendly episode
really really
interesting but
but do you know what's not
familyfriendly dead pool three going the
plugged in uh which um plugged
in plugged in plugged in is plugged in
it's one of the best sites on the
internet so I was reading three I was
reading through
um reading through uh plugged in was
reading through focus on the family I
was listening to Advent NY podcast like
a good Christian um you know like a good
Christian should reading reading through
focus on the reading reading plugged in
right
um and this review is
so my gosh it's not a review it's
discussing questions that of course are
legitimately going to happen in
non-focus world and like I said I really
really like focus on the family but okay
okay really I I don't know what w the
living in Deadpool and mov is the only
Marvel movie of 2024 and it's rated or
so obviously you shouldn't be watching
that obviously we both
agree so they go through here they go
through the history of the MCU and now
just saying um most people could take
their teenagers to go the MCU movies
without willing but explicit content but
now they'll be exposed to a quote SM
world of content engaging in Ranchi from
ribed nice use of the word don't know
what that means but you know it's always
good tickp vocabulary uh a suggestive
humor to vulgar visually suggestive
slight gas enough BL leting to make
Quinton tantos Kill Bill envious don't
know what they're talking about I don't
know what they're suggesting but I guess
they're suggesting something bad okay
and not to mention foul language F bombs
supposed to to toally into triple digits
but Discerning families may be able to
convince their kids to read the plot
summary online
which congratulations that's what I do I
go read plugged in then I know what
people are talking about people go talk
about this random movie I'm like what
are you guys talking about type in the
plugged in I'm like oh that's why I
haven't seen it anyway um also you
saying that sing families may be able to
convince their kids to go read something
online without you know the whole oh go
ask your parents to do this to do
congratulations congratulations and also
um the sheer number of cameos along is
going to be a huge draw for the fans of
previous X-Men who cares and the
cultural popularity of the film's title
characters on Fourth all Breaking Wings
MC Lord he can better be all over
teenager social media and teenagers Tech
stret okay um it might
be if I cared but you know most Comm is
probably doing if I was in school
because it's as you guys know it's some
um I'd probably be hearing about this
and have no idea what they were talking
about so that's probably true all right
um but here's where the difficulty as a
parent really comes in difficulty
difficulty yes you may have said no to
the previous deadpol F because they
explicit
content okay I didn't even know they
existed you can't say know what you
don't know exist your friends your kids
friends payments might have veto films
too yeah good luck with that
um Good
Luck Good luck with that kid no that's
not happening um but now what
no Fe up the films oh my
gosh
Congress the president they did not beat
up films but now know that the keep up
ongoing there in the highest ghting film
series of all time 29.8 almost $30
billion in earnings you may find
yourself considering a film that
probably would have landed in a video
rental store back room in the day if
you're able to say no I think you should
it would be hard especially if your team
starts feeling isolated from not seeing
it but opens the door for you as the
parents have really really important
conversations with about media to shment
and let's talk about this media
discernment discussion questions that
absolutely no one no one is going to be
asking their
kids um yeah
but but but the these these media
assuming questions I thought we got
we'll talk about those later what we
need to talk about is
um so I remember a few months ago in
April uh we were talking about the
parental compromise unless your kids
stay out until 12 I was like what the
heck are you doing up at 12 used to be
in
bed um I don't see how that's a
compromise
okay um
well I mean if you think your kids are
well you don't think they can sneak to
the movie theater or maybe pirate the
movie or maybe pirate the movie and the
kids fins of vetoing it yeah no sorry
sry the kids are gonna get in the car
and sneak off to the movies that's
what's gonna happen Okay like this is
exactly what Jules kle would do in
Avengers Odyssey exactly what she do
anyway let's get to the discussion
questions this movie initiate invites
audiences to laugh during the most [ __ ]
and our SE suggest moments how do you
think this
desination stop turning on gaming mode
there go how do you think this
desensitisation will affect you in
future good luck good luck and God bless
that ain't happening all right when you
hear the f word on repeat as in this
film do you notice that the St of
language is in grading yourself in the
brain even have you been tempting you to
use it yourself
smart kid would say no because a smart
kid would be playing these questions as
the oh I have a good Christian but I
want to see this movie so they' be
playing the questions like H that's
really good but also no it didn't really
affect me that's what the smart kids
would do um more like like the smart so
so imagine like Lucille Cunningham schz
or just Lucille and
uh in Kids Corner and Liz merging
together so Liz you know he's he's he's
smartish you know he he knows stuff
right and he's he's always getting into
all kinds of trouble like kids's been
kidnapped like three times um and then
lucil is like the lucil Cunningham Soul
so like this little Miss Goody to shoes
so You' be like oh I'm so perfect but
also I'm so
sneaky um when you answer these question
to in the way ging talks especially in
church groups okay and this this this is
probably a major problem R talks to
church groups in like the testimonies
that they give or whatever it is
so
stereotypical like it's exactly the same
and it's also
so
Sous like these kids are like yeah yeah
yeah that's truth that's truth and the
message was you shouldn't steal nah
really okay like they're
so I don't know what they're doing okay
yeah honestly they're probably Faking
It most of them I'm sorry y'all have got
to be Faking It your acting is
laughable
but like you're acting as no no that's
not deep no that's not that's
not that's not truth or facts okay this
isn't a
documentary but whatever we can talk
about CH groups next there's nothing
about Deadpool or Wolverine that
glorifies God and I like focus on the
family for this I like them providing
the sentence that said your pews aren't
going to see it to glorify God exactly
exactly
exactly who who who goes to a movie even
the Christian movie and sitting there
thinking I am actively glorifying God no
no no so thank you for writing that
sentence they're GNA see it because it's
supposed to have fun it's supposed to be
a fun film but if you don't see it where
you feel isolated from the friend from
your friends you
have
now okay now in this hypothetical lucel
Cunningham Schultz SL Liz person or
Coach Stevens right these will be the
correct answers to the questions to
watch the movie in my opinion all right
so for this question you're saying do
you think this type of desination will
affect you in the
future you might say yeah it will affect
me by uh you know you gotta be really
careful if you would to you know make
sure yeah to leave wiggle room right you
don't want to lock yourself in and I
swear if I hear lock in one more time
unless we're talking about a missile in
the middle of a church group
um you be
like what no I don't think I'm
desensitized because I'm in the spirit
whatever just string to go to church
word together whatever all and
then uh when you hear the f word on
repeat do you think it attempts you to
use it obviously you say no you say no
you say no if you say yes you're gonna
be like well I guess you're not going to
see it and then uh there's nothing but
Deadfall or Wolverine that glorifies God
that said your peers aren't going to see
it to glorify God no really and but if
you don't see if you feel isolated from
your friends you have now you
know this this is a this is a tricky
question because think about it Connie
kle wants Jules to have more Christian
friends that's why she got spana spana
Christiana I forgot her name that you
know the homeschooled girl who listens
to audio dramas with 17 siblings um over
over for dinner was it 17 or 11 I don't
remember it doesn't really matter okay
um over for dinner so if you say yes
they answer this question feel isolated
they be like oh find some spit Lanas and
you know SP they can find but maybe
these kids don't like SP because
obviously they're faking and you know at
school they're totally different people
um but if you say no then you know well
okay great I guess you won't see it
um and then says how you determine what
films are appropriate to see when you're
adult well the answer to this question
is you don't you just go look for
plugged in then you'll see the films or
whatever and then you can criticize them
and not see them again that's how it
works
um and what are the longterm effects of
seeing these films I'm not sure so
that's how so this this this is a tricky
question here these other two questions
pretty easy answers for those l/ lucil
type kids to answer right there so focus
on the family um also you know if they
are really smart kids they'll be
listening to listening and reading the
uh Focus on the Family Plugged In uh
plug plugged in broadcast because you
know yeah I mean it makes sense like you
got to listen so you can find out the
tactics
um anyway we we have more more more to
get into so we talked about the
AI build that's uh
happening
um the AI build uh not AI Bild but like
propos AI proposal stuff that's
happening in an article um it'll be
linked down the go it's on ADP and let's
go so let's talk about the gy D flip 6
more in depth about the uh new camera
tricks and apart from you know the oneui
6.1 update 1.1 update um
the uh updated 50 meg camera which is
it's okay I wish that motion photos
would come to the 60 megapixel 50
megapixel cameras on Samsung phones
think goodness is a team over ad and
um on on Samsung phones because I like
motion photos
um there's not really much to talk about
oh other than like T-Mobile savings take
one Focus here's a lot at T-Mobile you
get tons of benefits and you can still
save versus the other guys okay guys the
Samsung Z these are the new software
tricks that are on the flipsticks
they'll be coming to other phones too um
but some of these of course are talking
about the cover screen and and here we
go Galaxy store you can download
something called good luck once it's
downloaded open it up and look for the
multi if you're not in United States or
Canada where good luck I supported there
are APK versions of this available
speaking of AP we got to talk about
fortnite um we'll talk about that after
this video option because in here you'll
find this I love Galaxy foldable option
and if you tap on it then select
launcher widget now you can pick
whatever app you like onto the cover
screen which um and this really looks
like a fun like like a fun phone like I
I really try to push my phone to the
maximum limits as you can see we made a
nuclear bomb um with the power toy on
um you on on our article um you know we
some AI generation some email I wrote
entire Artic articles on here including
the one on ADP using you know the chat
conversation features on the keyboard
which have fortunately come back I was
able to like change the theme of the
phone and switch it to dark mode I think
this yeah no oh it's in light mode yeah
switch to the light mode to get the
everything to work no it's in dark mode
sorry it's in dark mode yeah to dark
mode to get everything to work properly
so now I can see the words that are on
the screen so the Samsung keyboard has a
problem issue I got it
remedy but you can see here from the
applications that you chooses here I
mean actually looks pretty productive
okay you got YouTube I don't know what
this is might be a game might be a Bible
app I'm not sure um Netflix which I'd
like to see what Netflix looks like
there I mean it's no probably no
different than watching from picture and
picture and it's a nice you know Square
display so I mean it's probably fine too
um it also saves battery so that's good
oh Chrome for browsing
jbt uh gallery that makes sense uh Gmail
Instagram uh Lightroom I have no idea
what that app is notes and Spotify like
this phone feels like something that you
can feel good about you know spending
time on Instagram or Spotify on but like
if you have a s24 Ultra I mean even
though they have like the same chip set
in there um you you want to use this
more for than just like games and web
browser you know screen or you could
just pick all of them then again go back
to the cover screen tap and hold down to
go to your widgets and right over here
you can add the good luck apps widgets
and have access to all your apps so you
can open up your emails and read through
those right on the cover screen which is
neat of course we go through all
applications now we got Dynamic
wallpaper and I think you can still do
this on Samsung not okay now the flip
six actually has a wallpaper that you
won't find anywhere else to find it just
tap and hold down on the cover screen
then swipe through the wallpapers and
you'll see it right over here now what's
so cool about this wallpaper is its
Dynamic meaning that it moves based on
how you move and reacts based on how you
tap the screen I'm not going to lie
it's DVD animation logo animation which
is really neat and what's also cool is
if you go back into settings then scroll
down to cover screen and tap on add new
in here if you scroll down you'll see
this interactive option and there's a
few other different ones to pick from it
looks really neat uh as well I'm glad
that we're getting back into interactive
uh
wallpapers
oh I mean it's a fun quirky wallpaper to
have but hopefully they add some more
designs soon then back inside your
wallaper oh okay it doesn't really do
okay but this is the thing that I think
if you scroll down you'll find this new
photo ambient wallpaper option and once
you tap on it you can yeah yeah I talked
about photo ambient wallpaper choose a
picture from your gallery to set as a
wallpaper and of course you can adjust
the clock or even choose an entirely
different clock but then check this out
once you set it as your wallpaper it'll
detect the weather and then display that
like whether it's raining or snowing and
the time of day based on where you are
and incorporate that into the wallpaper
kind of bringing it to life but we're
not done yet cuz I also suggest you guys
check out the informative wallpapers
where in the past you were able to
choose a picture from your gallery and
set that on your wallpaper as well as
change the colors too this is really
neat see it's like the customization um
I guess Fun phone
um other than like say a w house like
the
Galaxy S uh 24
Ultra whatever you want but now you can
also adjust the widgets so you can
remove and replace these widgets with a
couple different options like weather
stats battery info or notifications also
shows you know like power the power of
Android the power of fun right and it's
really sad that folding fold phones like
this are going to only become
mainstream in 2026 when all the team are
like hey wow great iPhone has a folding
phone it's so cool so Innovative
Innovative by seven years later there's
not a ton of options but still at least
you can choose what type of widgets
you'd like to see and of course you can
design it to suit your own unique style
but if none of that happens of course
that's when the flips will go in do it
for you then don't forget you can still
set an animated live wallpaper just like
this one that you can grab from haes
world.com I mean come on look how cool
that
looks okay now so now we're going to the
camera and I actually like some of these
camera features especially the video
calling abilities and this makes it like
one of the best phones for video calling
I didn't say the fold which is I guess
arguably better because you can still
see stuff and do more on the screen the
flip six got a huge camera update from
12 maps to 50 which is pretty massive
but you'll notice that when you take
pictures if you swipe up to the
information it still takes them in 12
megapixels like I said yeah no one's
going to
be um also what is live effect let me
take a front facing picture no one's
going to be um you know changing 50
megapixels to 12 like those the 17,000
Olympians only the tax savy ones are
going to be um doing
that but to change this all you actually
have to do is open up the camera and
under photo mode tap on this 12m so it
goes to 50 megapixels but then head into
your camera settings and scroll all the
way down until you see settings to keep
and right the problem with 50 megapixels
is that
um nope I don't have that feature yet
okay to the trash it goes um the only
problem with the 50 megapixels is that
it is bit slower um you can do some
things to improve the speed but still a
bit slow um it has uh
it loses some features um and also when
you zoom in this isn't a problem of
course on the uh Z flip but on phone to
have Optical cameras let's say has a
three times optical zoom camera um it
doesn't activate the three times optical
zoom camera it just CS with the 50
megapixel C which essenti which I rather
to
activate so here's what I would do if I
if I could use my 50 megapixel one even
200 N not 200 200 smudges too much but
50 I think 50 is a good compromise um
all the time so I'd say in one to two it
always works and then when it starts
zooming in so it's three to 10 um of
course you use my Optical lenses there
because not sorry three and five and 10
I'm use my lenses there because you know
that's what I paid for the phone for I
could have got an s24 plus and I didn't
want to do all that zoom and um also has
live photos enabled I don't know why uh
not live photos motion photos are
enabled I don't know why motion photos
can't be enabled on a 50 megapixel
centor okay we got 512 gab of storage
here um and you can record up to 8K
video so I'm that's say yeah it's
ridiculous here turn on high picture
resolution now every time you open the
camera it'll instantly be on 50
megapixels so you don't have to switch
it
on and you can just snap some fcks and
get this you can also use the updated
camera for video calls so to do that
just open up a video calling app on the
cover screen like WhatsApp for example
then in your contacts if you start a
video call with someone it of course use
that so useful um especially since you
can flip it over use it as a stand it
can track you when you move around the
room so that that is probably going to
be the best phone video calls main
camera and your video quality will be so
much better and another also I wonder if
you can use that thing as a webcam like
just snap it onto your laptop new camera
trick to the flip six is if you go into
video mode and flex your phone to hold
it like this and then hit the cord
button it activates this cam cord mode
where you can zoom in and out using just
your thumb and that's neat but I like to
see what the ergonomics of that feels
like matter you know holding it like
this um as you guys know I'm from the e
sh SS ltw series you know I Ran news
channel filmed it all on phone so um I
like to see what it looks like and a few
other settings just like a camcorder and
while it's folded if you press this
button the viewfinder will drop down to
the lowest screen and this way you can
take waste level photos which actually
look better than taking photos from ey
level but enough
about I guess
it I wonder what the Optics of that is
it's taking pictures this is why um you
know phones going to be um
more useful um from now on uh like they
have all these different modes here I
mean if you think about it you can even
use this as a uh I got one of these
like
endoscopes right um the test out from
companies you know can go through drains
go into like small small spaces underd
doors and stuff like that um so it can
be used for either a uh know inspections
of drains and stuff or B as like a spy
toy you know like night vision goggles
or whatever I mean do Z flip I mean it
can be argued that it can do that I mean
you can pop it up and it can tape a room
for however long you like um even live
live remote into it um of course like
off with home cam or whatever or you can
stick on the doors and like see if the
room is secure the flips also has some
tricks to transforming them too oh well
I mean technically you can do that with
any phone but you can flip it up so you
can see the uh see the viewfinder of
course I'm not responsible for if you
play your phone doing that so just
Samsung would recommend
that now they three really cool ways you
can transform your photos the first one
is if you choose a pick of a person and
then press this little icon over here
the Magic episode I believe that
Samsung's going to all over to
cloud-based artificial intelligence
features because it's going to generate
revenue for them so that's why you know
I have to counter with saying some of
the stuff you can already do offline
already where you'll find this new
portrait studio option and if you select
portrait studio you'll get four
different art sty to choose from like
comic 3D cartoon watercolor and sketch
just go you can get you know
water waterolor I think it's oil painted
image on your Samsung
galy and pick one of these CU what it'll
do is transform that person into that
art style which is actually a lot ofun
also like to see what this looks like
um compared to Samsung's aremoji to play
around with it's not always a 100% %
accurate but still you can definitely
see their features and if you ask me
this is a pretty cool way for making
some stickers but I'd also love to see
this feature work for pets too so
Samsung if you're
listening then for the second transform
pick again if you have a photo of
someone or yourself and you swipe up on
it you'll now see this live effects hole
in your head and if you tap on it it'll
turn your photo into a 3D video which
basically gives your pick a bunch of
depth which actually looks really cool
and you can use it for one specific
reason which I'll show you a bit later
then the that's really interesting um so
I guess it's coming out to the oneui 6.6
update I also like to see what kind of
data it uses so like uh if it's taking
photos of the ultra wide um as
well third trick is back inside this
magic editor and it's called sketch to
image so let's say you wanted to add
something to one of your picks well all
you do is just draw whatever it is you
want using your finger like a Golden
Crown for example and don't worry if
your drawing's bad once you're done just
click on generate
and detect what you drew and add it to
your photo as if it was there in real
life well this works and while you're
drawing a little trick you can do is if
you hold down at the end of your sketch
it'll actually correct the shape so that
the result comes out much better and I
mean these results are just absolutely
insane it's a lot of fun to play with
and I was actually really oh it's the
fake I'm wonder you sketched in I'm
really excited for this um you know 2025
is going to be an important year for
schools you know I've always been on the
Forefront of this you know since
2018 you know we always had our policy
of you know not saying anything so I
couldn't be like cloned or spliced
together um by by Rivals um but also we
we tried to learn Photoshop so we could
like you
[Music]
know like let see what fake security can
images look like of Rivals doing
something or scandals etc etc like that
but now people can just like pick pick
out the phones and start drawing stuff
in
um I wonder what kind of things people
could be drawing that could you know get
you in trouble let's say someone drew I
don't
know let me
think bricks yes bricks and then
coincidentally the next day there's a
window broken well you know I like to
see what this is happening so I'd like
to see what kind of you know metadata
investigations that I get into you know
image oent it's GNA be such a great year
for all the Teen Spies all over the
world surprised with how accurate it is
so you've just got to try this
out so remember that 3D photo we made
earlier now let me show you what you can
actually use it for if you go into your
phone app and then enter contacts and
select your own contact you'll now see
that you can set up your own profile
card so once you tap it it'll take you
to this section where you can then go
into your gallery and select that 3D
video we made earlier it'll give you a
quick preview of your profile card but
then you can still go and edited even
more by tapping on your name and making
the font a bit thick it's really
interesting you can do all this and it
will pop up when people call so sh edit
um I was okay now let me show you
another brand new feature that you just
have to try SS really interesting and I
hope Samsung you know shows this off to
the Olympians um when they're done with
their events inside the side panel
you'll Now find this icon and with it
you can actually draw out anything on
your screen it does not need to be
perfect or anything as you can see great
you know for spin enabled phones like
the flip uh like the fold and because
once you're done if you select this art
style and pick from one of these five
different options then tap on generate
bu flp 6 will completely transform your
sketch into a proper artwork this is
just so cool and another thing you can
do is open up a picture then sketch to
image and if you tap on these three
little dots you'll notice this
transparency option where you can drop
the transparency and actually Trace over
your picture again by no means does it
have to be perfect as you can see and
when you're done just pick an art style
tap on generate and you got a sick
artwork that's that is better than the
uh filters that you can these features
did work offline so that you know it
didn't uh you know take data up on
servers which of course we're going to
have to pay for but you know it's going
to be neat while we have them um and
hopefully maybe Samsung can add you know
part down version of these features to
the chips because these are pretty power
Fones of different things by the way if
you're ever a notes you can actually do
the same thing here too just draw
selection around your sketch tap on
generate and but bam in a couple of
seconds you've got a much better drawing
I mean this isn't even a smartphone
anymore it's just on a whole another
level hi we're visible getting set to
travel this summer and need a wireless
plan that'll keep you
connected okay so we're not actually
done with the side panel just yet cuz
right under the sketch to image option
you'll Now find the smart select and
there are three different tricks you can
do with this I'm glad that they improved
this um and hopefully they make the edge
panels faster cuz my Edge panel is kind
of slow PO stter is if you're scrolling
through Instagram for example and want
to quickly take as do ask a screenshot
of anything just tap on literally any
image you'd like to save it'll instantly
come up with these options where you can
share that image or you can download it
straight to your gallery you can also
tap on any text to instantly select it
which is so cool especially for things
like Instagram where you can't usually
copy text and for the third trick
instead of tapping to take a screenshot
you could just draw around the exact
area you'd like so it's more precise or
you can use these little handles to
adjust the size and save that as a
screenshot but as smart as the side
panel is it's not actually the smartest
part of the
flip I want to bring the side panel to
the front screen okay so here are a few
of the smartest quick tips that everyone
should know and I'm leaving the best one
forast for the first tip if you hold
down on your navigation bar or Senter
button you this is ridiculous the way
that they're Mar getting Circle to
search is a groundbreaking new feature
is ridiculous okay watch this scan your
entire screen and there's a few that's
great that's great I use C to search L
like we say I don't know what all these
teenage go fast and TR are so you know
we scanned images we found out the tips
on it's not that good just takes me some
shopping website but there are other
tools that can do this for you but we
also use this to copy and translate text
on the
screen you can do with this like if
you're scrolling through social media
and watching Wheels then tap and hold
down on the center button you can Circle
any on the that makes sense that makes
sense and it'll quickly look it up on
Google for you I mean this is
ridiculously useful or if you need any
text translated you can point your
camera at it hold down the scan button
and if you tap on that that's ridiculous
why would you that doesn't make sense
that makes zero sense at all okay first
of all on a Samsung phone you got Bixby
Vision Ena in here
somewhere did they take it away no it's
right here okay okay I just have to
unlock my phone to use it Bixby Vision
can translate text if you don't want to
do that let say right within the camera
okay so it's it's a setting in the cam
option and it's also a separate app so
let's I have Bixby Vision
here oh they took translation abilities
out of bxby vision so now it's just a
wine searching
app let me see oh no it's just toned off
for me okay there we go I was gonna say
all right yes so bigp Vision has the
translate mode
and I'm translating
translating I don't think it translated
from English to
uh okay but big spe Vision has translate
mode it may not be good so you also have
Google lens which is pre-installed into
Google mobile application so you got it
you to type Sut with your camera you
click and then you click the translate
button and this and the sign says this
way to the bathrooms
why would
anyone open up the camera app okay wait
for it to load hold down a circle to
search button circle around
there uh hold this down click translate
and it opens up in Google Translate that
doesn't make any sense people are not
using Circle switch the way it's
supposed to be intended translation icon
all of it gets translated I'm also very
mad about
the uh and this looks like it's a bit
updated but I'm also very mad about the
way that
Google Google assistant is being used
now like they they've pushed for Gemini
which has no personality not a good
voice
and it's
just it's not that good then for my has
no phone control like why would I want
to just ask
Jimi some something like that I just
wanted to like open my application start
my time which is why Bigby is better
it's quick smart tip and this one going
to save you a ton of time inside Samsung
internet while scrolling through web
pages if you come across a super long
article did you know that you can just
that's actually useful I actually used
it to summarize Samsung's terms of
service tap this icon right over here
tap on summarize and your flip will scan
the entire page and summarize it in a
few points for you and if you tap on
this icon you can even ask it to give
you a more detailed summary just in case
that's a good but I I need samung and I
still have it as my default browser but
I need to get get a lot better
want that little bit of extra info this
is really
cool so believe it or not but I also
like to see how to phone text because
you know we already have prean resp
sponsors already and I also despise the
way that Google messages is being forced
onto millions of Samsung devices of
course it's still in the Galaxy store um
for now and the probably APK version of
it but Google messages is objectively
worse okay first of all if you want to
copy a text in s message it's really
easy select the text you copy it you
paste it in Google messages you can't do
that so I guess you have to use Circle
to search which sends to the internet um
which I mean it's probably fine but I I
just don't like Google messages it it
doesn't allow you to copy your text
because when holding it down for you you
to um send reactions to them um texting
is linear so scrolling through only
pulls up the latest text that you have
sent to you instead of um having like
organization like a sane person um it it
it's in the style of iMessage and um
because it's using RCS um it hasn't been
opened up yet so the only other RCS
messaging application that's legitimate
is beeper mini right so if you want to
use a better texting application like
Google Samsung messages or text uh too
bad uh too bad so sad
um I I hope to see someday that the same
way that Samsung's
um like b mini is able to sync to Google
messages um I think it uses the way that
Google messages is able to send messages
to your computer it just signs in as a
computer on a BP message server or
something and it sends a message there
and sends it via BP message so you do
send by RS don't know how secure that is
but I hope it does come as an option to
other messaging applications because
honestly Google messages is terrible I
mean it looks like a message and I
message looks terrible B6 can actually
write all your messages for you it is so
easy and all you have to do is go into
your messages app and in here just go
into any chat i' also like to see how
good uh if it's only with Google
messages or if it's with any messages
application because you know text
translation does work on like Samsung
messages I think it works on WhatsApp a
text translation but doesn't work on
Instagram and press this magic compose
iccon and basically what this does is
reads your most recent texts and writes
a message for you based on what you said
in your previous text with that contact
this is course on device if you wanted
to instantly reply to someone this is
literally the best way to do it because
it sounds like you and it includes
emojis take it a step further if you
select this icon inside the Samsung
keyboard you'll find this composer
option and this is basically a chat
composer so in this box you just out
what message you want to write you can
also then choose the format like an
email for example and the tone of that
message whether that's casual polite or
professional just click generate and
it'll write everything for you you can
just press insert then it'll go into
your mail and you can send it off saving
you so much time it's really great but I
doubt the people who have tons of emails
to send because I was listening to the
book The Signal or something like that
losing the signal which for some reason
they had to make into an R rated movie
which is really sad um they should not
use bad language in books like that or
movies U anyway losing the signal um and
I talking about blackberry and like
sending emails and people like sending
all kinds of emails I don't think this
the people send the emails are going to
be buying phones like that it's email I
still stand by email being amazing one
of the Great Inventions
so and back inside this icon on your
keyboard you'll also find writing styles
or what I like to call rewrites because
basically this and this is next Tak your
a message you've already written and
just rewrite it for you but in a
different style so it can text for you
but it can also talk for
youour this would be useful in the
Olympics so this next trick is probably
one of the most unique things you can do
on the flip 6 by now I'm pretty sure a
lot of you know about The Interpreter
app that also I'm interested to see what
the new Samsung oneui software looks
like it looks
like it's 20 2015 called Samsung I want
the icons back it's what you're saying
from one language to another language
but on the flip it now has this new
cover screen button that if you press it
you'll notice that whatever you say will
actually get translated to the cover
screen for the other person which makes
it so much easier for them and whatever
they say will then get translated for
you on the main screen I mean this was
just such a smart move from Samsung and
as you can see the flip 6 is a
Powerhouse full of some of the coolest
Tech out there and there's even more
they can do so make sure you check out
these videos for that but I'll see you
guys in the next one all right so good
for good on Samsung for including all
these features and I really wish say
advertising them a lot more not just
some of the AI stuff because these are
smartphones um we spend thousands of
dollars on them so I um hope that they
uh do
well okay
um we we really need to get to a place
where we we do more with our smartphones
and texting calling and some like gaming
um because it it is not
worth it's not worth it you
know second I about the OnePlus pad too
I'm going to be reacting this brand
new all right let's get this bad boy out
of the box really excited to see what
this thing can do of course there has a
tab not a phone I didn't even know to
release it yet so I'm really
interesting this episode of some Gadget
guy is brought to you by viewers like
you all of the amazing people who share
content across social media and the
generosity of my awesome patrons at
patreon.com guy more info on those
awesome nerds later in the video I think
we're going to see a lot of chatter
about this right here this is the
OnePlus Pad 2 it just showed up on my
door very
interesting um box um usually they did
do like white on white so it looks
seamless like Samsung does black on
black I'm with that tablet I thought it
was one of the best bang for buck deals
in a high performance Android slate and
here is the beautiful OnePlus Pad 2 see
nice to see plastic covering on the
tablet not being like
Oh environment I pull on this tab here
if I pull that kind of pops out now I'm
happy to see more companies doing things
like putting tabs and pulls so that it's
easier to get a product out of the box I
think that's some really nice
accessibility consideration that one was
a little stiff it kind of popped out of
the box right there there's that big old
camera sensor module like we had on the
first one looking at this right here if
you just kind of like zoom in pan right
there you go it kind of looks like a old
phone still good 2015 plus pad I just
want to set this aside just to see in
the main box what else uh we might have
here got some papers and a cable this
box was super thin so I wasn't expecting
the fullon uh you know the charger the
brick in the box with

it oh that's great I'm glad that there's
a charger in the
rep where a stylus is going to snap on
and charge USBC and a couple more
speakers on the other side and then
right there we got a trio of pogo pins
that's where I think uh the keyboard is
going to snap that's nice I do wish and
I do wish this for Samsung too so I'm
not being biased that did have a
headphone jack or maybe an extra USBC
slot so you can you know plug stuff in
not just charger if you need it
especially for a tablet like use which
are probably going to use as laptop
Replacements on make this kind of a
little Android laptop replacement we're
part of a full review after I've had a
little time to use it ah let's get this
thing fired up I really want to see
what's going on with this tablet little
OnePlus spinner getting a started and
hello what a what a lovely introduction
I wonder if that's live or if it's at
because I was pretty fast SC up it's
live and we're going to tap on that I
speak the English we're in the United
States kind of fly through this here
user
agreement this is set up you know stuff
you see all the
time at least last time I checked and
now I'm going to just kind of skip
through this so off of another device
I'm an adult or a teen at least last
time I checked and now I'm going to just
kind of skip through this so you don't
see all of my Google credentials okay
we're back in I've already set up
password unlock that they have here so
it doesn't look like is it a fingerprint
I'm not sure but my super secret
password of 1 two 3 4 5 and the only
other option here is a Face Unlock so
enroll face for best interesting that
they don't have a fingerprint scanner I
like fingerprint scanners personally
kind of links back to the Spy thing
where it's like if you find fingerprints
I thought maybe you could put them in
unfortunately all the applications that
do that only let you you have to have an
exteral fingerprint scanner but I do
likeing results keep the device 20 cm
I'm going to see if I can just hover
over it to also why is it in centimeters
like this this is we did select America
but in Freedom Units which
be seven inches up my face it's pointing
directly at my little overhead camera
here no that's not going to work see in
an awkward angle it's a funny angle
oh and that was
it I like to see how secure that is I'm
pretty sure someone can make a 3D model
of one because you know he famous I can
unlock with my face that's maybe one of
the fastest Face Unlock uh enrollments
that I've ever done okay continue setup
let's see SPO me else we have to
continue I'm going to say I agree for
Google
Assistant uh for that keyword that
trigger there to start the assistant I'm
just agreeing to all this stuff here
interesting I like to see how you know
well that works on this tablet and I'm
glad actually interesting that they see
the setup for Google assistant and not
Gemini uh change wallpaper I want a nice
dark wallpaper so let's see what
wallpapers they've got interesting
wallpapers I want to know how to make
these things um I pretty sure they use
like not inkscape's what's the Adobe one
Whatever Adobe is in
design o do I go with the dark green I
think I kind of like that dark green g
to do this we're just going to stick to
it we're going to apply to both home and
lock screens ready to go I guess it
looks like it you know melds beautifully
with the OnePlus 12 oh and also yeah
it'll match the green on my uh my
OnePlus Watch 2 R elegant ooh we'll do
that that was so dumb all right let me
get out of wallpapers I think we're all
done setting this up we can hit next get
getting the tablet started let's get it
started so let look at the screen here
so we still have the oral one right
there bright red which is nice and we
have an interesting dock kind of reminds
me of a Mac
so um but I do like that's on the base
level and not and like some like on De
level of course you have a edge panel
right there so looks interesting I would
like less Mac OS inspired design um but
these icons do look considerably better
than whatever Samsung is in here and we
are greeted with a tablet very familiar
looking if you've caught any coverage or
if you are playing with a OnePlus open
only now in a slightly wider aspect
ratio bringing me right back to what I
really liked about the uh the first
OnePlus T I really wonder what you can
what you would do on here right I like
you know I shot and edited News videos
on my phone right um
so I mean I would not shoot on that
tablet the camera of course wouldn't be
as good I would edit but
if I have a phone I just edit on the
phone at 6.6 inches is good enough um
especially since the camera and all the
transfer I wouldn't want to have to
transfer and do all that now if I didn't
have this if I just had this as a
computer that would be fine I guess but
you know my phone did support deck so I
just plug it into some monitor so I
really like to see what interesting use
cases this has um I guess gaming might
be better because he
um that's the consider problem that we
have um today we
have we're going to get into this after
the video's open I'll just I'll leave it
there oxygen OS has become a much
heavier skin but it's still one of the
more fluid responsive it's has a
vertical app drawer I do like Samsung's
dra better at least on phones but this
might make sense more on laptops because
you know that's how the Windows app
looks it's got a really good feel to it
you know flick up just kind of check
what what apps are here I'm not seeing a
lot of bloat we've got the OnePlus like
clone tablet community um WPS office but
I believe uh did not
come that's the OnePlus clock there's
the kid space but that's a Google WPS
office I think that might be one of oh
and Netflix I keep for like Netflix has
just been such a consistent install I
tend to look past it but there's not a
lot on here taking up space that's a
really clean installation I'm really
happy to see that yep nice and smooth
getting us into that little Google SI
there I don't think oh we've got the
other couple apps just on a separate uh
home screen here I see we already have
the little dock that can flick out
welcome to Smart sidebar let's go ahead
and get that started and this is really
handy this is one of my favorite
additions that we find on the OnePlus
open and the smaller version of this
that actually ends up on OnePlus phones
where you can drag and drop to here it's
very fluid and it's very gesture heavy
of course yeah it i' like to see I'd
have to go to Best Buy something which
one's more fluid Samsung what kind of
dranky or OnePlus but in a in in a
really organic way so I think this is uh
one of my favorite additions to the
OnePlus UI we pulled up the main app
tray but then we have this little guy
right here where we can get a condensed
list view bit more of like a that's
interesting um especially since you have
the edge panel there but I'd like to see
how good that feature is especially with
the keyboard and the mouse a start
button menu of apps that are installed
then I just want to check the
notification sh I wish come up in the
middle as a start button in my opinion I
just love how this is being formatted on
uh tablets and on folding phones right
now this like pan yeah it does look like
a nice
panel
um for the notification
shade I like to see what it looks like
in
portrait pel view it's very evocative of
the surface Duo we're kind of treating
this as as like separate rectangular
spaces I think that makes tablet
functionality really accessible that
makes sense that makes sense and I like
to see what kind of a because the S is
Duo I like that I had to app dra like
pop up on both sides of the phone it it
was like uh less work to get split
screens and say A Z flip of course the Z
flip in my opinion I'd rather have a Z
flip than the surface Duo um I don't
know about one well I mean a lot of this
is being brought in just from Android 14
and I'm sure this will get an Android 15
update but it's like the little editions
like having a full
recent files recent documents recent
images that are very quick to access
that then you can drag and drop into a
number of other apps these little
OnePlus editions are pretty Savvy this
is the kind of stuff that I wish Google
was actually copying more it leaves
Google pixel like stock Android is very
it's very D it's very
dry a bit more of the sense of stock
Android it's not as granded departure as
some of these other manufacturer skins
but it's really clean functionality for
gestures and that's the thing that I
think tablets need a lot of help with
just opening up the gallery we've got
another little popup here just telling
us about functionality we can enable
split view Oro some of that
functionality that I've come to enjoy
with my Samsung phone like I believe
that probably be one of the only Brands
I probably switch to like because it's
intuitive it's made for power uses
window and this is another thing too I
think OnePlus does this better than
anyone else touch and hold to show The
Tap bar let's get started we do have the
ability to cut out I loved this when I
started seeing it on the OnePlus phones
you just tap in that's night that's nice
I like that having that picture ability
my hold and it it cuts out the subject
now obviously I don't have any photos I
literally just turned this on for the
first time but I wanted to show this off
again instead of making you go through
the multitasking view so you can go into
multitasking and then tap on a little
menu and you get these options like you
can lock an app floating window split
screen et lo app is really nice Etc
instead I'm gonna pull and then I'm
going to pull up and there's a little
release point right there and now I've
got a little floating that's neat um I
like to see how this is implemented on
other people's tablets to see how meat
it is um in comparison but I like this
floating window a lot it reminds me of
uh the windows 11 the way that they deal
with gestures you know touch pad things
of that nature I've got a little
floating app and I can manage it just
like a floating window in a more
windowed desktop top operating system
that's what I mean when I talk about an
experience being just a little bit more
organic you only need the conveyance
once of seeing that there's something
that you can do you pull it up also as
he's loading the applications it look
looks very Snappy and fluid how my phone
always feels you know um windows on 120
HZ not in power saving of course thing
that's kind of turning on behind my
finger I wonder what that oh floating
window release oh look it just did the
thing that I wanted it to do when we
talk about conveyance and we talk about
communicating functionality to the user
it's that kind of stuff that I think
OnePlus has gotten a lot better at
obviously there's still room because
there's going to be a ton of stuff if I
go into settings we're going to have to
get into like how how it autoc connects
to phones we're going to have to review
how it handles power management um we're
going to have to see what kind of
updates but it's been interesting seeing
the subtle differences in Philosophy
from the OnePlus open to the Google
pixel tablet and the pixel fold Google's
version of this is really good but I
think OnePlus is actually solved a few
of these usability quirks yeah yeah I
like OnePlus software over pixel
software I believe I'm also interested
in seeing what the pixel9 pro F looks
like um unfortunately I do like the
naming scheme um
un popular opinion I like the naming
scheme because it added into the line
line instead of like making it its own
line which I like um but the cameras
aren't going to be as good which is what
Samsung does but no I condem Samsung for
that I can Google for that there's a
little micro do right there and I can
hold on it again to minimize it oh that
is really cute that is a lot smaller
than I was expecting it to be yeah
that's that's cute all right let's just
do uh that would also be very good for
precise operations say with a
stylus a quick uh we'll do files drag
this over here drop
files Lexy spot asked me to help promote
their most stable table basee that they
have ever offered the E7
plus I have a new system version update
so even when it was checking for updates
it really wasn't checking for updates I
don't have anything on it I 2.7 gig of
apps oh wow okay and how much storage is
on do oh so probably about 256 but that
was all that was kind of installed this
is the 256 gig version should be plenty
for a little multimedia tablet maybe get
a little extra work done I'll be curious
to see how this says like multimedia and
get a little extra work done like
they've been saying that since the '90s
for multimedia computers and I this
proba we're going to like stop the video
and that's you know we have a problem
okay we have a problem now right and I
talked about this in my article on the
tech.org
um it's that we we
we I believe have all
these computers available to us with all
this power right let's go to the specs
of my computer and phone okay um Galaxy
s24 Ultra you know 12 gigs of RAM 52 gab
of storage Snapdragon H and three um and
this has an Intel car i7 uh and 12 gigas
of RAM and 5 12 gab of storage we need
an internet alternative because the
problem is you go on and I've been
talking about this for weeks you know
you go to any web you go to any website
right you find like some of the best
softwares are they're going to tell you
can but be Express soft phot which does
work offline so I guess you're not
indicted in this for now um there's 12
gigabyt of RAM on here and an Intel Core
i7 right the sticker say it the sticker
doesn't likee all right I just able to
do more on this computer offline than
you know
um like what what here's what's built
into of the thing and here's what works
offline photos with very very light
editing calculator which does have
graphic and calculators um and uh
notepad and word pad um and if paid for
it w um oh in paint all right but that's
it drawing typing and um oh files and
photos that's it okay the rest of the
apps here on my pinned app screen which
I didn't pin this is how it came oh in
calculator we got Edge which of course
is a brows Microsoft store and App Store
settings which equipment I the Xbox
which I don't know if you need internet
for that but you need internet for the G
some of the games um solitary which I
think you the internet for because it
runs agenda Spotify WhatsApp uh LinkedIn
uh clock whatever uh movies and TV which
is yeah you have to purchase movies on
here so I think needs internet access
that's the problem we've become too
reliant on web applications so no on to
my mobile phone right like I said snapon
hent 3 and 12 gabes of ram arguably more
powerful and faster than my laptop
itself which is why I use it to do all
the video edits it has fast internet
speeds because you know it has 5G data
and um that it's actually faster to do
the edits on here D Vinci resolve
crashes on my computer um some Co Video
Edit I have of course crash this on my
computer didn't SE to redownload it my
most used application of course the
Bible app whatever um we got Gmail
internet searching Maps which except for
the download of maps all of that works
online all right then we get to the
video editing whatever that that's one
thing that's offline but then all the a
applications um even my photo face
recognition application doesn't work
anymore I can't get the download um but
after that most of these applications
are you know settings apps and note apps
and coding apps um most of the stuff has
to have an internet connection to work
most of the applications that we use
online on um on our phones are just
rappers for a browser like I said in the
90s and ear 2000s we had internet power
programs that worked offline um
unfortunately Microsoft not in
encyclopedia in 2009 now Bradway
internet is ubiquitous and everything is
on the web including phones most land
lines use V which means dollup doesn't
really work anymore and they also
require power to work if internet went
out um that all forms of data
communication like Tex SP and stuff like
that fail right um throughout the 1970s
AT&T made video phones video you know
confering technology that work directly
through the phone in the line right
people worked on computer terminals
linked to a Mainframe in the office on
personal computers the floppy de so they
remote in via the phone network which at
this time was copper based and so you
have to think of Dr blackard Nicholas
Adams dialing in to the computer systems
that were in in the school they weren't
using the internet because these
episodes of course typed in 1989 and
1993 I believe they're not using the
internet they just using like
dollup um to dial into these computer
systems so they're not accessing the
worldwide web um but e well the power
did go out but the power what's it
called fried his computer and prent the
out download connections um and then now
in the early 90s and early 2000s you go
back go watch an lgr episode about
multimedia PCS you got videos and
encyclopedias all of this downloaded
onto your
computer onto the computers because Bri
band connections people didn't have them
or they're expensive right so here's
what we need to do we need to have more
land applications so we have a Wi-Fi
network here at the house if the Wi-Fi I
mean if the internet would to go out of
course the Wi-Fi could still be up at
Network and we have all these Network
and Sharing features you know built into
windows we have some of them built into
Android I don't know if they're built
into Mac OS and iOS
um but
like we we need more like home servers
and and accessing information um at
least in in the broader context of like
a w like a neighborhood W so maybe you
can chat with your
neighbors
without uh without interference maybe
perhaps via radio radio link to the
compu radio link to the computer um you
know you can order stuff in the stores
local government offices and libraries
to access information because I believe
that this isn't good right the the top
applications on pcmc um shouldn't be
canva for things of this nature canva
YouTube co-pilot chat gbt top
applications right
um um Spotify Apple music all of these
are just web
right I want to be able to have a
society have computer systems a able to
be interconnected with each other um
Network like they were in the 70s and in
the 80s um if nothing else but for the
fun of doing it and Al and the fun of
computing the fun of offline Computing
shouldn't be regulated to notes
documents PowerPoint presentations like
what you have that which I can't make
PowerPoint presentations but fun I need
to have a puropose to
uh to be doing them with um like we need
have a reason on why I shouldn't have a
Chromebook that I really can't find a
reason for that other than like cell
phone
um investigations
right like other than gaming which I
don't
do much of um they we need we need these
computers to work more offline this web
app trend is getting out of hand that's
what I'm going to talk about that's the
part two of this right so the Tope
applications canva YouTube even MC
converter like I I would like to have a
file converter that works offline like
in the 90s they didn't have the internet
um processing to do it and they had
limited power right so the applications
when as Advance well now we have the
power to do it okay we have the power to
do all these types of things I like to
see more applications come and harness
the power of this of our computers and
not just harness the power of our web
browsers okay that's all I have to say
for that article I'm glad that we read
get back to our typical three articles a
week all right and then um how to make a
nuclear B oh four four actually we did
four articles a week this week how to
make a nuclear bomb in the power toy um
so the power toy is this physics
simulation application that allows you
to simulate the different reactions
between chemicals and dust and sand and
stuff like that and I teach you to make
nuke in here so if you guys want that
make sure to go check that out okay um
stuffs
so so much to talk about but please
please let's stop with this web TR let's
let's be
better
[Music]
um oh we got an email let's see if it's
important no okay um
let's see what else is there to talk
about in Tech news right so let's go to
the YouTube subscription
list oh oh we got to talk about this um
so fortnite um has removed their game
from the Samsung uh Galaxy store it's
still available by APK and the fortnite
is doing this is to be annoying okay
they're mad that Samsung is um is
uh so sorry so sorry is removing access
uh to downloading apks um normally so
the new phones are coming pre-programmed
of Auto blocker turned on so it say an
extra step that you have to turn off to
prevent APK downloads from happening and
[Music]
um epic games is mad about this because
epic games just likes to get mad these
people the these like miniature
protesters okay this this is like the
tech equivalent of just up oil okay
these miniature uh protesters are like
whining and crying about Samsung just
adding a lock that turns off uh that
that disables APK andless you really
want to have APK turned on it's whatever
right and this is exactly why you need
to have APK those locks on it's for um
it's it's for our
friends it's for our older you know
friends you don't really know any better
okay there was vulnerability inside of a
t inside a telegram that basically had
APK downloads turned on in the form of
video what happens when you accidentally
hire a North Korean hacker nothing good
so anyway I'm just going to summarize
this they these people accidentally
hired a North Korean hacker who
pretending to be no not North Korean he
put Mar on the computer and they fixed
it but anyway here we go
here's the
exper next up researchers have
discovered a telegram exploit being sold
on xss xss is one of the internet's
oldest hacking forums which is primarily
Russian speaking so please excuse the
god aful translation that's coming up
the seller an krono claims to be selling
some kind of telegram APK installed
Android MP4 exploits they didn't name a
price but they did offer to provide a
demo for potential buyers okay but
unfortunately for anono ESET researcher
just so happened to be lurking on xss
and dm' him asking for that demo the
exploit works like this the hacker sends
what appears to be a regular 30 second
long MP4 video but when you tap it
telegram says it's unable to play it and
suggests opening it in an external
player it's important to note given
telegram downloads media by default that
video or malware as it will soon become
apparent is at this point already on
your phone after tapping open it becomes
pretty clear that the video was somehow
In apk in disguise
but for the APK to actually install you
have to do a series of very stupid
things and this is just a second step to
protect people from doing this um to
themselves like keep Samsung phone safe
it also um has the uh prevents from Bad
USB cables from taking over the phone
now some I had this turned off because
it's really annoying um because I insall
APK a lot but you know I'm a tech
blogger okay I'm smart Okay some people
aren't um as up to date on technology
about what the good and bad applications
are so I suggest you know leaving that
turned on for their safety also if
someone were to get a hold of your phone
it would keep them uh it would it would
take them more time to disable those
settings to
uh it to disable settings
to uh install like a mesis APK under
like a parental control spy whatever
which results in the malware in this
case some kind of x hamster premium mod
being installed on your phone obviously
this isn't the kind of pack I would
expect any of my subscribers to ever
fall for however for the Boomers in our
lives that's going to be a very
different story especially if the
exploit is combined with a clever social
engineering campaign for example maybe
telling people they have to tap install
in order to make the video play properly
EET researchers have been unable to
recreate the exploit so they can't say
exactly how it works however they're
guessing that the specific payload is
most likely crafted using the telegram
API the API gives developers granular
control over how attachments are crafted
and this isn't the first time it's been
exploited just 3 months ago a different
bug meant hackers could send Python
scripts also disguised as videos but
this was arguably way way worse because
merely clicking on I wonder how this
works what looked like a video would
trigger the underlying python script to
run which could cause a calculator to
open like in this proof of Concepts or
perhaps something way worse though you
did have to have python installed for
this to even work in this case the
problem was simply down to a typo in the
telegram desk St source code which meant
Pi ZW a very particular python file
extension was misspelled as Pi wz no no
to be fair to be fair right now I was
just criticizing web applications for
stuff like this but for stuff that's
already on the web I really don't see
the point and this is why I really want
to see a increase of landbased
communicators I actually have one
downloaded on here on my phone it's
called Brier unfortunately doesn't have
IOS because it's one of those people
protesting the lockdown of iOS um and
also I guess it's something wrong with
IOS as well
um I like to see more landbased
communication um applications come to
device as well but and we'll get into
that later but the problem with this is
like applications like Discord and
telegram they only work online so I just
used a website I don't really see any
use that than maybe notifications which
you can get in the browser on why we
anyone would download the
Discord application um I guess you can
download the mobile application with Mak
sense but I don't really get why you
download the desktop application right
so if your application is just a web app
I don't really see the point of a
desktop app but if it's a web app that
does work offline like say Google Docs
or Microsoft Word then of course I want
the desktop app
um but speaking of landbased
communication as you guys know I'm a
really big fan of reading High School
like hacking stories or something like
that really like I really want to see
the PO and point of
communication computers than you
know just web based tools so I you know
go into red and and read these stories
and you know back in the early days like
say 2000 um the 2000s early 2000 some of
the kids would be sending in commands
using netson or message pumpt of like
Windows XP and sending messages over the
network via command command pump which
doesn't work on Windows anymore I guess
there's some too many security
vulnerabilities in it or something right
and able to chat like that again I like
to see more exploration of computer
systems uh like that and and the really
interesting way that you can do this
like you go back and learn what people
were doing computers back in 2005 is you
know search searching for newspapers and
articles um and then setting your
browser to 2005 so let me let me show
you how you do that
um let me share my tab here you go so
you go to Google you can do this on
mobile but you have to set a desktop
site um
there you go so hope you can see this
on screen um what you do is you go here
and then let's say you want to go list
Samsung let's say you want to see some
stuff about Samsung from like
2005 you get anytime you go down to
custom range you go
to
five and now you only find some stuff
that's pre 2005 and you can find
information about what people you know
de with computers and cell phones maybe
some old cof phone manuals searching
like that so I I find that to be really
really interesting so let's get back to
the exploit and so the true extension
just wasn't on telegram's list of
dangerous file types in the case of
apk's disguised as videos the
researchers reported it to telegram who
and then they got back to them so that's
basically all there is on that exploit
for now okay um in celebrating our
anniversary um I guess we can talk about
all our accomplishments that we've had
um thus far so we have AA Harper of
course we more teenage girls and The
Verge um we started new new websites and
sites in TV um and we got great review
devices like the new phone the Samsung
phone um the Samsung s24
Ultra uh
um so we've
done we've done great things for Samsung
we've got not with our reviews we've
done so much and I really hope that we
can be around for the next Olympics and
um talk talk more and hopefully even
Eclipse 10 years thousands of episodes
um and I'm really glad that we've we've
been able to do
here
um let's talk about the Google pixel
9 which I'm excited to see what it will
be
doing so the Google pixel 9 UM
I believe it's going to have a call new
call recording and transcribing feature
using Gemini Nano
um to summarize what you talked about on
the phone I really like to see how many
people actually use that like how many
people have like hourong phone calls um
with people but here we go it's called
phone notes Here We Go Gemini Nano could
create an AI P summary up the call some
people was good of data
but
um oh apple is going to do that too
interesting okay so um call notes is
going to do that it might summarize it
and if it's not summarized of course you
can copy and paste that into the chat
GPT it might do this on
device um let's see what the comments
are saying because I I I feel like it's
gonna be split no no comment yet oh no
comment yet okay um and here we go over
to the Google pixel9 pro that might have
a new color coming out over here but
let's go to Talis Tech um oh let's talk
about this Google Assistant might be
gone which is sad I really like Google
Assistant uh I really worked hard like
in 2017 2018 2016 to be getting Google
assistant on my phones and devices when
it was coming out yet and it wasn't I
didn't have a t phone
tablets um so that was really really sad
um
where but I do like that Bixby is here
um
let's go to Talis
Tech and there might be an iPhone 17
slim here we
go let's talk about the Google pixel 9
iPhone SC and I guess that's it uh if
unless you want
more is the
[Music]
police Google back in 2017 isn't the
iPhone terrible our phones true true are
so much better than the iPhone they're
so much more unique and creative with
the hardware and the software it was
unique pretty nachy
and ugly cannot be beat Google now it's
just like the iPhone please buy it it's
so much like the iPhone please I promise
you won't even notice you're not using
an iPhone the problem with that is just
idal pressure on you know
youth it'll be unrecognizable from the
iPhone you'll just be using our phone
instead which costs just as much please
buy it please buy it please please buy
it I must admit you know I ranted a lot
on I almost forgot MKBHD got visited by
FBI because of the
Escobar phone and they wanted the
track scan behind and they arrested the
guy so back in the day they made just a
lot of blant bad I mean look up this is
uh 7 years ago so uh 2017 maybe 2016 um
depending on when it came out this is
still ugly for 2016 that's that's that's
fine for 2016 but these okay that's fine
but the front of the phone were ugly
this is that were so easy to make fun of
over and over again it was kind of belly
flop product after belly flop product
then the pixel 3A and 4A started coming
around and I was like Okay Google's kind
of got this budget phone thing figured
out these were genu genuinely good
phones and then even the flagship
started to get really good around the
pixel I remember all hype around the
Google 3 pixel 3 6 and seven era oh and
the pixel 6 hype oh my goodness pixel8
Honestly made me kind of want to switch
to it permanently if it weren't for the
wallet app and of course the ecosystem
interesting how Google pixels on nine
when they released in
2016 it's 20124 wow eight years of
pixels that I'm already a part of I was
kind of ready to ditch my iPhone phone
and just jump ship and make my way over
to the pixel 8 it was a very very close
call and I think overall it's kind of
difficult for me to be I don't really
understand the appeal of phones like the
pixel8
like if you're going to get it at least
get the pro because you get a telephoto
Zoom I don't see why people don't me
care much Tel Zoom very rant worthy 18
19 I was like I was all I was like
teleph Zoom better than Ultra wide I
didn't even have a phone and all the
polls that I was doing on Android auid
and stuff like that because you know
telephoto means
spy scope in your pocket like I say cell
phones are the Ultimate Spy tool and I
stand by that words Google these days
because both the budget phones and the
flagships are just solid options I've
genuinely recommended them to people in
my personal life and I think they you
guys think Google pixel 8A or Google
pixel 7 a fantastic job with the lineup
but then we started getting leaks for
the pixel 9 and it's not ex that's fine
I do like the visor design of mind your
Samsung Galaxy S 10 exactly like like
pixel 3 or pixel 2 days ofing this is
that is way too much space right there
also nice to see that they're sticking
with the temperature center maybe they
could add something here to clear off
the space maybe a bigger Flash and belly
flop but it definitely to me at least
feels like Google's kind of giving up a
bit more on originality which is
certainly that is the most original
phone design I've ever seen shame after
my whole Samsung Rant on how similar a
lot of Samsung's Hardware is becoming to
Apple accessories with Google it's a
little bit more noticeable on the phones
themselves with a lot of these leaks
it's straight up like okay every year
this is feeling more and more like an
iPhone and for no real reason why are
companies deciding to make their chassis
more squared up it does look nice let me
see what my phone chassic looks like me
check oh no mine is Ed I don't really
care what the Ed or some like holding
them or anything but I do like that
these sides are kind of flat but curved
so it's easy to hold for video recording
I was kind of against this from the
beginning I always felt like it was less
comfortable and this was one thing about
the pixel that I actually really really
liked was that rounded chassis design
and I like to see you know what it feels
like in the whole I've always been in
love ever since the pixel 6 days with
the visor design and they've refined it
a little bit with the seven and the
eight but particularly with the new
pixel 9 Pro fold horrible name Choice
actually like that name like I said
Google what why are we doing this pixel
fold was fine did you just suddenly feel
like you needed more syllables do you
get paid by the letter but with the
camera bump on the pixel 9 fun fact I
think the longest phone name or one of
the longest phone names was the Galaxy
S7 Edge Olympic
Edition uh might have been Galaxy S21
Olympic S21 5G Olympic Edition I think
that one both oh fold it's honestly just
going more and more in the iPhone
direction of let's just have a square
bump up in the corner yeah that that's
not really fair to Google I mean it's a
folding phone and no one's going to get
confused right that I mean if honestly
you might the biggest compliment or
insult you can give it would be timu
look ripoff I that looks nothing like an
iPhone other than like square but it's a
folding phone so I I I call it
Innovation and for those who maybe are
unaware the visor camera bump design is
still in my opinion the best camera bump
you can possibly have because we've
discovered that there's no way to
eliminate the camera bump I don't I
don't know what they mean like I would
like for my battery to just extend to
the camera that' be nice I may get an
extra 10,000 m not 10,000 1,000 milliamp
hour if they could get 10,000 that would
be also be nice exactly know why but
even the Energizer phone Energizer
doesn't really make phones so they they
would know good design if it hit them in
the head and if good design hit them in
the head they probably get knocked out
because this thing weighs like half a
camera bump there's just apparently too
many advantages to having a protrusion
from the lens maybe also people
criticize the Energizer phone's camera
because it's trash nothing to do with
Optical image stabilization I don't know
but camera bumps aren't going away we
can't make the phones that much thicker
anyway but if you're going to have the
lenses protrude out the back seriously
just making it flat across the top kind
of reminiscent of the old Nexus 6p days
eliminates the phone from wobbling when
you place it on a table and now camera
bumps have gotten so comically large on
the back of our phones that even when
you add a case to your phone it doesn't
eliminate the wobble now the cases have
to have camera bumps on them too because
of how much these lenses stick out
Google I had thought had figured out
this issue and I was begging Apple to
copy Google and bring the visor design
to the iPhone but nope instead now
Google is copying so I was like come on
leave iOS leave iOS come on Android
better but he didn't do it he didn't do
it more bad iPhone camera design and
bringing it over to their phone although
somehow they made it worse with the
double oval shape design I don't know
it's just feels wrong to me I get that
it's a weird thing to complain about
because most people aren't looking at
the camera bump except for me whenever
I'm recording these videos I have to
stare in the face that stupid Pikachu
Face camera bump that Tim Cook thought
was the right call for the iPhone the
stov top design there's a part of me I
mean it's kind of iconic I didn't like
it when it first came out in 2019 I was
criticizing it when at least when the
leaks were coming out uh yeah I was I
was always criticizing been criticizing
Apple even before we started this
channel um in fact I knew the Galaxy
Note 10 was going to come with three
software updates he has a soft update
because the Android
update um came right after the release
so I was like going to call that update
number three and I was correct so I've
been criticizing Apple for a long long
time me the kind of misses talking to
that pixel 8 back when I since 2018
actually no way way back viewed it
camera app was a lot more functional we
eliminated the wobble I had the faster
and easier one of those I could do more
videos without having to use a front
facing camera by the way data
transferring to my Mac with that USBC
Port being full speed and not having to
go through some stupid dated Final Cut
camera import process or image capture
or having to hope that airdrop is in a
good mood that day genuinely really
liking the pixel and yes the regular
pixel 9 and 9 Pro look fine the leaks
and rumors about them are not
particularly exciting because I really
liked the chassis of the eight and the
Seven being more rounded off tianium now
they're going the direction of well we
got to be more like the iPhone so let's
make it more squared off it doesn't
matter that that's that's the problem
like no and that's when need to get into
when your i7
um companies are heading more towards
the iPhone and it's annoying because if
I want an iPhone i' get an iPhone I
don't want an iPhone and of course I
will always stick with Android I don't
care if it looks directly like an iPhone
whip off at Le it has Android under the
hood when I can install apks on here I
can um you got Samsung Dex etc etc okay
the countless benefits better cameras
better software better display out but
the design does um matter to me oh I
forgot to talk about s GPT but here we
go um one i7 might take a big
p Apple's IOS Playbook and of course
Samsung AI features will probably be
better than Apple's AI features so this
is what the notification show will look
like no does um it is inspired by um of
course the one 6 um one I do wish and
I'm going to compare this to my R run
yeah I do wish that the brightness and I
actually do like the the volume looks
like um I don't have any music playing
so I would know what that looks like um
and brightness
um I don't know why it's side by side
but okay I mean it would it would be
okay if you just added the brightness
underneath right there and then I got
Smart View over here also i' like to see
what notifications look like okay that
camera application that's not what it's
going to look like really I I hope it
doesn't look right there I'm putting an
icon pack on this
thing in 2015 call they want your cam
icon on back okay look this is
a right here's the 2015 here's like a
2015 Android phone okay top 15
smartphones of
2015 okay I just want to see what the
camera icons look like so here's a
Samsung that's what the cam icon looks
like I mean it kind of looks closer to
that and even that looks better and
touch wiz was a good skin okay I don't
give it anyone says there one looks
exactly like camera here's the iPhone do
I have a camera up there that one looks
fine
um there's another Samsung Nexus there's
no screen Motorola not showing the
camera there we go all right all of
those look significantly better than
whatever Abomination this is I mean I do
like that it's rounded maybe if they
change the color a little bit but this
looks old okay um continuity
notifications to nearby devices that's
whatever um and then here's their
Samsung camera application they move
everything down to the bottom so it kind
of looks like an
iPhone um but it does have a distinct
Samsung feel and they still have the
flow thing but then the gallery
application I mean it looks ugly
like really really
ugly um let me see if I can pull it
up and I know you can skin it but I hope
I can skin it back to like I did I
actually like the Samsung Experience 9.5
icons like the like the little period of
time they had like from 2017 to 2018
where they transition from touch widge
to what
the S9 LA Swift I actually like those
icons and you can't get those icons back
so I really hope that they make a oneu
six icon pack um because I don't like
these icons they have and icon packs
kind of slow down the phone um
in my opinion so here here's from 952
Google and this these might just be fake
leaks hereo um but here we
go here's what the gallery application
looks like that's annoying that's ugly
um it looks like a flower okay
um that's fine I guess it's nice to have
everything down at them level hopefully
I don't accid tap anything when taking a
picture though um yeah so oh hi Kate wow
finally we got a chat um how are you um
and do you have any Tech questions for
the final I guess 15 minutes of the
stream and as we wait for Kate to type
in um what are you guys opinions on the
oneui updates
um people seem split on it it seems very
Chinese
OEM um
so hopefully that they
do hopefully uh Samsung listens to their
fans and do you know what they
what they would
like okay um let's see what in chat we
have Kate do you have any
questions okay let me just check Reddit
for the oneui
seven update and speaking of Reddit
they've been very very crazy j z Oh My
Gosh okay so one 6.1.1 is coming out I'm
really excited about that for all the
iPhone oh Kate has a question uh yes my
phone is taking up lots of STS despite
getting rid of all I can restarting and
seeing everything is updated more um
Kate you have an Android phone right um
I believe it's Samsung so make sure that
your trash is uh empty because when you
delete stuff it usually goes to the
trash so in gallery or files um you have
to go and click something at the bottom
and it will empty your trash so let me
see if I can pull it up on the screen
here so let's say I have gallery and
then you
go you click this menu at the bottom
these dots there and then you click this
icon that says trash and then when you
click trash um there'll be images in
there so I took an image during the
podcast today and then you'll click
there to Perman need delete it and then
in files uh oh the trash is empty
H um maybe I have lots of applications
on there
um um there might be some extra trash in
the files um if you have a Samsung you
can activate this thing called
storage and device care so just you
swipe down swipe down you swipe up
here uh no you probably don't need to
reset um because you need to back up
everything of course but what you do is
you would swipe up here and then you
click search and you switch
storage and this thing um will come up
called storage in device care and it
will show you what's taking up all your
storage so right now it shows me how
much storage I have how many unused apps
I have how many duplicate files and
large files that I have and you can um
delete those um you can delete whatever
you don't need also Google makes a files
app it's in the Play Store it's
free and um it looks like this it's uh
the Google colors so red green and blue
um hopefully you can see it on the
screen it's that app right there um you
open that up and make sure you of course
allow it to uh send your file
and then you
click you click clean so you click the
hamburger menu at the top right there
and you C clean and it will clean out
your storage you it will find all your
drunk files old screenshots large files
that you don't need uh you can go check
to if you don't need them anymore large
recordings and stuff like that sometimes
um things just download and you just
don't see them anymore they get like
mixed up in the file system so um
hopefully that answers your question
okay let's check to see if Kate has
anything
else no not yet okay so as we're waiting
on Kate um here's some more pictures um
per
Reddit that's the gallery icon it looks
very annoying and people are saying
touch wi icons are looking better than
that yes exactly TouchWiz TouchWiz had
all the features and that was a good
thing that I liked about Samsung I
didn't have any of their products but
you know oh we can't even see it I
didn't have any of their products but
you
know it it was
nice um so I I really wish Samsung would
do better do better just go back to the
basics
uh
k um
did your problem get
fixed okay let's see so if it's not my
Google files or Google Docs that's my
other files um
yeah maybe Google files is just an
application and you can find you know
some of the large files and downloads
that may um come here sometimes when you
go to a website it automatically
triggers downloads onto your phone um do
you know what kind of uh phone you have
and like how you use it
all right let's check what the comment
says you have a door
knob a door knob phone what's that
[Music]
finally let me check maybe there's an
update
um oh a download maybe
um yeah and you can delete all downloads
that you don't need just make sure that
it's nothing important like a important
picture document or password you have
saved oh Arc search has now come to iOS
which
is okay I guess um orc is I I looked at
the browser it's okay I finally got
access to the windows
version Oh Galaxy a3s okay so that's
kind of like a uh think I have it in the
dra over here so it's kind of like this
phone here okay so it has limited
storage uh on the
phone
so there is a here's some things you can
do to C clean up pH this mix it the
trash is same old images that you don't
need you can put in the trash and delete
or you can upload them to Google photos
you get 15 gigaby to free storage there
and then just delete them from your
device so it's up in the cloud um in
your files you can
use there's this thing here when you
scroll down to the bottom of files
called manage storage and it will find
large files and help you delete them or
duplicate files and help you delete them
if you don't need them and then the
other file management applications like
Google files it can help you do that um
if you want we can put out a dedicated
video or or article about this on how
you can manage your files um it will be
up on YouTube probably before tomorrow
um if you would like that so you can
tell me if we should make that for you
all right let me check the uh comments
all right and as our last comment comes
in
now
um you know that's all for now God bless
and here's to another five 10 15 years
of tech talk congratulations to avention
Odyssey and just remember that software
is not going to help friendships unless
Odyssey B there try that check Reddit um
you deleted all your internal files the
Galaxy 27 Ultra doesn't
work and okay that's not a phone kid
um yeah uhhuh yeah okay uh bye</pre>
