<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 4624</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody Welcome to the
this week in the Tech booy podcast we
have plenty to talk about today in fact
I found this new
AI tool for hacking finally unfor L it
has a rate limmit for fre
users um I guess we could do this
interesting comparison I was thinking
about
son uh mark five six whatever versus the
s24 plus and um we also produced One
article this week so let's get into that
article and fortunately I haven't
listened to the new pause and tells
episode so I guess you have to hear
about my experience with listen to that
next week because I cannot play the
entire episode on a as that would
potentially be illegal also um running
a the digital
influencer means that I now am an expert
on women's fashion everyone knows that
um so anyway here's our first article
how to compare phones like a pro
I'm trying to remember that I found some
new spy apps for your phone make them
more epic and also my drone was stolen
or lost or something so we're gonna have
to find new one to test out and
review and hello to viewer number one
please uh say something in the chat
anyway here we go Tech boy guide how to
compare phone to like a pro hello Tech
Enthusiast Tech boy here today we in to
World phone
comparisons and the way that you do this
is using versus.com we talked about this
last um week on the podcast but it can
um it can compare phones cities
countries Etc uh um for you now it does
have some um problems here um when it
Compares chips in Ram that's pretty good
like more horsepower more RAM it's good
but camera comparisons it would say
compare the S uh 10 lower than some say
the a15 because technically the a15 has
better Mega more megapixels then we know
that megapixels aren't everything um
battery life it also avoids battery
battery not to battery life based upon
tests but battery size and as we found
out battery size doesn't always mean
battery life um if that was true then
the pixel 8 would have better battery
life than the assus and Fromm 10 but it
doesn't as we saw last week on the
podcast it also allows you to compare
other stuff um between categories though
of course that means it's going to be
kind of inaccurate like you can compare
say galaxy a15 to the city of Houston
the city of Houston to the United States
of America uh United States of America
to some random satellite and space the
possibility is are almost
endless oh also congratulations to
Samsung after a few long months months
um they back to being number one in the
world uh the throning Apple so
congratulations to Samsung for that
speaking of Samsung in desktop mode um
Samsung uh is leading the way with
features such as secure folder andex and
Android is stealing those featur fees
here we go um check out this
headline Android 15 hasn't released yet
but Android 15 may have more
um let's see where is it yes Android 15
feature that can turn your smartphone
into a desktop computer he getting a
revamped desktop mode from built-in
desktop mode since 2009 and also it's
getting private space private space is B
going to be essentially secure folder um
but for Android phones which
congratulations glad to
see um that there more choices out here
which means that I mean I could
potentially if I wanted to leave Samsung
like if we get deck over here we get
secure fold over here the only thing
that's holding us back is Bix which
thankfully is going to be getting its uh
generative AI um
update uh Come on load
Bixby will be getting his generative AI
update so congratulations to Bixby um
here we
go yes so I think it's great because um
it's going to solve common problems that
it has like say I say um um
call uh sorry say text Dad I want um
first
from
HB well instead of texting Dad the
contacting there and then the message
that they say it's going to try to find
a contact named dad I want gy some HP
and of course I don't have anyone in my
phone whose name that I want G from HB
so it's not going to find him so just B
we needs to get a little bit smarter and
because it's integrated with the phone I
believe it can do that and having a
generative AI on the phone powered by
Voice is pretty good also I got to go
hands on with a is actually not as bad
as I thought it was it's actually faster
than some phones um so that's pretty
interesting right there I have a video
that I wanted to react to yeah let's
talk about oneui
6.1 recently and for no reason let me go
check on
something
one UI 6.1 are we still up all right
that's
great there you
go all right
man that's a lot of Samsung phones so
what do we have here looks like we have
course for Ultra and then zold 5 okay
then the Z flip five maybe that's the 23
Ultra some 23s maybe it's a55 a 15 can't
really
see oh yeah unfortunately so that's an
s23 these may not be coming the s22 may
be coming s22 I mean it could decide if
I still um my battery actually did
pretty well today I did have 5G off so
I'm wondering if that's a battery
to all right let's check this
out yeah I see you got to download it
okay so you can already do that whoa
that's amazing that's great that is
genuinely useful
nice I'm glad that we're getting
Photoshop like
capabilities speaking of Photoshop like
capabilities I saw that open a saw and
also uh open AI chat plus doy for images
now has Photoshop like capabilities
where can edit images inside using AI
That's
great you know what would be kind of
nice is if the phones new next to each
other like right NFC or Bluetooth you
and you could go like drag the screen
and
go that would be
next that's nice
um I wonder how fast it is in real life
I know this
editing
man that's a good- looking
Sofie those are literally the same
effects you can use in the
gallery um just apply it to the Lo just
just taking steps off of
that
nice
that's
nice you can do that now just it's not
as
seist
how many widgets can you put up
to again you can do
that I kind of like the new download it
for I wonder if there's an AI font maker
because if I could use that in inst the
fonts on the Galaxy
store all
right
that's neat of course you can do this
other browsers by copy and pasting but
it's nice to have it built in to Samsung
internet you can actually get me to
switch back to Samsung internet from
Microsoft Ed
again this is so
useful I do wish it worked on device
though uh correct me if I'm wrong if
that isn't it works on the cloud because
if it works on device that's
amazing
oh yeah this is neat I got to test this
out at the Samsung
store
uhoh all right AI
features that is
uh
very very convoluted you have Google
Lens built in I mean that is more for
screenshots I find myself using this
instead having to take screenshots of
stuff on Instagram um for
technology research we'll get into that
later it's really
interesting that's
useful
useful useful of course that is embedded
in swift key so if you want that on any
Galaxy phone you can go get it by using
swift key if you like swift
key right let's see what else oh yeah
they got this wallpaper thing
unfortunately it syns to Google so it's
not like s samung exclusive and it's
very controlled like you can only change
some of these words here you can pick
some of these themes but it's controlled
so it's I guess you could say yes it's
all of them are unique but you only have
a set amount of styles and words you can
use
which I
mean you can probably do this in other
tools too like the tool I use to gener
my AI influencer playground and pretty
you can just type in whatever you want
and download it but this is just you
know on device so it's easier so like
most of this stuff is possible that
image editing that you saw at the
beginning possible uh already the image
editing like remaster I mean you can do
that like manually uh the lock screen
stuff is already possible some good luck
modules and stuff um the different fonts
of course um and of
course text and audio
transcripts possible possible you I'm
glad you don't have to pay for those and
it's built into the phone so it's just
Samsung's making everything easier
making everything more accessible on
device which means some of these things
probably going cost me CLE search free
uh it's going to stay fre
um so four people probably will stay
fore but some of the more advanced
features like transcri transcription
summarization of your um recordings
maybe L of the word of internet articles
but definitely a bit so then you might
have to go out to
more more services like I mean with just
a few apps say playground AI for the
image generation chat TPT co-pilot for
summarization and then you download a
transcriber and then input that data
into just regular text AI software you
can get all of this but of course that
takes up
storage this is very
useful uh if you talk to people in other
languages right let's see
okay okay if we've all seen this we've
all seen
this interpreter we've also seen this is
kind of it'd be nice if it could keep up
with
okay
I mean that's nice but I mean you've
already been able to erase Stu for like
two years um one UI not oneui OnePlus
added AI to their phones um I think they
also added their own AI Magic Eraser I
think someone was mad about that because
they were glad that they didn't have ai
in it as a selling point and they called
it refresh which is kind of
interesting
can you uh replace this guy because I
have Sky replacement applications on my
phone that's useful very
useful okay that's useful I wish you
could like text text it like the sky
is just white and blue
this is bigger and it does add an
annoying thing at the bottom Watermark
which you can't have to I
mean yeah it's it's
annoying
I saw this in stores pretty good pretty
good wonder if it works on videos to
import like say maybe a video from the
internet cuz I was doing some
analysis on a Instagram story
um and I had to slow it down and like
analyze it frame by frame to extract
information that could be putting into
the state of the
school um you know into key questions um
it didn't really answer key questions
and I did pause some of the images
through CH by AI I think is accurate um
but that's unrelated but it would been
nice and instead of having to like go go
by frame by frame and download and stuff
if I could hold it down and do slowmo
but I probably still have to go frame by
frame because I mean someone put like a
100 pictures and like uh oh this reminds
me there's this new app I don't know if
it's new but it is amazing it scanned my
phone okay completely offline um all the
pictures I have and the faal recognition
percentage I mean it's it is bonkos I
don't this to analyze the IG story I
thing to see if someone of different
color here was the same thing
unfortunately it didn't work so we have
to go to a cloud facial recognition uh
matching program but this Gallery app I
mean
this uh pix short Gallery it's in the
Play store okay so you can search by
objects and stuff but you can also
search by um photos and I mean faces and
of course you can name the faces and it
finds people that are super duper blur
like it finds them in group pictures it
extracts them from like super blurry
pictures in fact I kid you're not okay
there's this one picture in my gallery
let me pull it
up wait a
sec there it is okay it's face recordist
and technology so good and remember this
is completely Offline that it extracts
an image of half of someone's face
obscured by a uh by some 's pants okay
and then it matches it to the same image
but in black and white and then another
image why I kid you not the guy face is
completely tuned around and all you see
is his ear and hair and this is a zoomed
in like 30 time zoom image I am like
when I take this image let me see about
it let me check the
details it zooms in all the way
you can barely see them and it finds the
image like so much better than the
built-in Facebook Edition I you should
download this application it also can
find search for Stuff based upon what uh
object it it is so it has uh human face
detection posting detection clothing
detection you can feel just like that
man woman which I mean I'm glad uh some
people know what that is it detects
images that have phones in them does
pretty pretty well in them um it does
mess up um with calculators like see it
classifies my Casio calculator as a oh
you can't even see it classifies my
CIO oh my gosh you never even saw the
video okay fine it classifies my CIO
calculator as a phone also C screenshots
as phones and also my Pesco MP3 player
as phones but I most of the stuff it
that's great it classifies as phones or
ACC phones including a picture of
someone holding one in the back of an
iPhone 14 has pictures of me holding it
okay um it class things of e um
airplanes okay this is interesting I
have a picture of a boy and a girl um
that's been like
edited so they're like close to each
other in the same image um um and they
gets classified as a boy picture so
that's interesting
but okay okay so it classifies girl girl
women women then computer mouse camera
office building scoreboard picture frame
Jean snack headphones vehicle
registration for all the license plate
pictures I have oh is this one okay
jacket bicycle helmet ceiling fan
fashion accessory convenience store
watch teddy bear handcuff
what is this H this is not a handgun but
I mean that's a decent classification
wheelchair bookcase jacket I mean this
is great and then of course you can
extract the location that out of your
images and place them on a map so I me
honestly this is one of the greatest
Gallery applications of all time all now
let's go back to the video hopefully you
can see it on the screen this time all
right here we go going back to the
video gallery because right over here
you'll now see some different speed
control options so let's say I wanted to
half the speed in a certain section just
you could do this but it's more advanced
uh what it granular move the bars for
whatever section you want I'm not sure
if it's just slowing it down regular SL
it down or if it's doing frame
interation or divide it and have two
separate sections where the video slows
down then just click save and now you
have a custom slow motion video so cool
all right quick tips okay now here are
my top four most useful quick tips if
you ever want to share more than one
pick at a time one thing I bet you to
know is if you select all the images and
then just drag now you can instantly
share all those images just by opening
up another app and drop it's nice drag
and drop like a computer speaking of uh
for deskop mode it didn't support that
which is kind of sad uh at least the
Android 14 15 um not Dex Dex is in I
mean this is really Nifty I wonder if
Samsung will support Android 15's new
like private mode CU if that is true um
you could have three secret profiles and
there are three separate Pro passwords
amazing I wish Samsung had guest mode or
like two different profiles on there
like this is phone called the um armad
phone where if you type in a password um
that's wrong but you set it it will go
to a totally separate home scem I mean
that that is great security right there
um and I long for those that kind of
security and this one's also really
useful because let's say you're busy
getting a Spam call if you answer it
with a text to call button you can
actually speak to the other person just
by typing out a text and the voice will
read it2 million of Life Supply time of
invisible ink wow uh I wish it didn't
give you that stupid disclaimer at the
top because then they probably
grab oh thanks let me claim that before
it disappears but what's extra cool
about this is within the text call
settings you can add your own voice and
actually make it sound like you all you
have to do to train the voice great
unless of course you get hacked but of
course I'm pretty sure my voice I mean
I's voice off 5 seconds for audio so um
and it sounded decent so uh using this
uh cloney AI so I mean
whatever this is read out 10 different
you can probably clone my voice right
now I have more than five seconds of
audio on my random sentences then wait
for it to process and in a couple of
minutes you got your own personal voice
that doesn't sound too bad this is what
it sounds like when you use text call O
that nothing like let's say you actually
get a Spam call there's a new option to
actually speaking of spam calls um
Google may be adding in call look up on
it pixel phone I'm wondering how it
works like would be a massive database
something like that like two alternative
because I know taller like steals your
phone data that's how they get their
database make a tag for that contact so
instead of saving that contact you can
actually just tag it like Bank spam
caller and see that in your recents but
without having to save it to your
contacts but nice probably the most
useful out of them all is now if you
create an alarm and scroll all the way
to the bottom you can add a custom alarm
background and what's even better you
know Samsung's do better and advertise
all these features like people need to
know about the stuff they can do on your
phones I guarantee you like Samsung
Galaxy s20 has more features than say an
iPhone 15 right
now is it doesn't have to be an image it
can even be a video and if you tap on
the clock you can even choose from three
different clock Styles so this is really
nice to customize each of your different
daily alarms whether it's for workouts
taking medication or Waking Up I mean
sometimes I just think about smartphones
I mean they completely amaze me there
some many Ultimate Spy tools all time
look at you got pocket video recorder um
map and you can pull up
satellite um feed on your phone in less
than five
seconds
um you can take your notes you AI tools
right they sitting there in your pocket
um search search engines you do some o
computer PHS stuff like that you can
think up information on almost anything
I mean simply amazing I mean say the CIA
had this in
1960 amazing easy tell what a l is just
by looking at the background and by the
way if you're wondering where you can
get this slick animated kind of looks
like the iPhone SE three like background
then check out my website hworld
docomo so bam now you have it some sweet
Gallery tricks all right let's go Sam
Su
um let's see stop
sharing what else have we
here oh okay here we go we got preview
of the Galaxy I mean of developer mode
um Android
15 so let's let's check it out this is
from Juan Vell we interviewed him few uh
some time ago on this channel one of our
most popular
videos well it's about time time that
the pixels have gotten proper features
befitting other premium tier maybe I'll
get a pixel who knows I mean think about
it we uh coming up to get the Samsung
features no probably not no
stylus um and the AI video I mean image
I
think besides I'm not so sure about the
chip I'd have to test it out see say if
the pixel 8 or 8 Pro chip and cameras um
can compete with say an Ultra 24 plus in
terms of video editing
and video recording that's a lot what I
do that's what's the most
intensive thing I do on my phone um
maybe I'll try to run Windows on it
we'll see I mean I know that someone got
Windows running on a pixel
6 but it was rooted and I'm not going to
loot my phone because I like my phone
well kind
of phone finally wiped out my pixel 8
Pro it's running Android 15 developer
Preview 2 and that is is providing us
with actual video output all right let's
see here we got Luma Fusion up with
video output interesting how the phone
didn't turn into a
touchpad and it is uh still showing
screen also I don't see it DOC but he
could have hidden it through the USBC
that's a first for any pixel and Android
15 is replacing some of the
functionality we have in the Android
alternative view desktop mode mode it's
not really a desktop mode it's just an
it's just an alternate canvas that the
phone can put out of videos I'm getting
ahead of myself here the history all
right all right let
uh go here deal that the pixel oh no no
no I want to see what it looks like an
action how to enable it fix this right
here let's check it out currently
running but compared to what we've had
for the last couple years though this is
phenomenally more functional it just
makes sense there's so much wait is this
the desktop
okay that's useful I wish you could like
maybe split it a little bit because
that's I mean that' be kind of weird to
do on a mouse like 69 power in this
thing and you can get it out in a better
way when you connect it to a larger
Monitor and maybe you hook it up to
other accessories it's why I love these
little lap docks that have a keyboard
and a trackpad we're not getting all of
the fancy stuff that you'll get on ready
for or Samsung Dex you know quickly uh
tabbing apps to side by side split the
view you're not toggling through apps
easily like you can on a Windows machine
like all tabbing through that doesn't
really seem to work it's just I have
accident it encouraging that any
attention has been paid to this
additional functionality it's kind of
silly if you think about it but you
could pick up an inexpensive or sort of
a mid-spec Chromebook and end up with a
less powerful machine than the phone
that's in your pocket true true of
course if you wanted to use it for
school they might put phone the hango so
of course like I mean come on how many
kids actually put the phone in the
handang gr person experience it's
one and I and I'm the one
okay we've been overdue the ability to
plug in a phone to a display and get at
least some kind of Chromebook style
experience I mean I wish there was a doc
because this looks like just some like
random Android tab 2014 what is this
button here is this like the like the
this looks like Android on a tablet from
2014 display and get at least some kind
of Chromebook style experience the thing
holding his back it would be nice if it
could run Chrome OS or Windows or Linux
remember Linux on Dex like 2019 on that
super expensive Galaxy Tab S4 that I
wanted for like three years and it was
still super expensive I'm like why you
so expensive then I didn't even have a
fingerprint scin so I was like eh I
can't take my fingerprint samples with
it
so though I realized some of the
fingerprint sample applications that you
have like you know for fingerprint
matching like for suspects and stuff
like that
um or
not you have to use an external
fingerprint scanner so it's kind of a
moot point unfortunately speaking of
forensics and stuff like that there is
no handwriting analysis application on
the in the play to that would be nice
like if I could just like easily take
pictures of handwriting because this has
actually happened before I'm not making
up hypotheticals like I make up
hypotheticals in my world all the time
like we have hypothetical in my brain
that it pertains to uh rules um like you
know like my real world and then the
hypothetical world and makeup stuff bit
right so I'm not talking about the
hypothetical this actually happened in
the real world like a small circle
hypothetical big circle
um uh someone was like writing notes
notes on tables at schools and
unfortunately I didn't have the
foresight to collect everyone's
handwriting so I had to do it after that
but then of course people know I was
trying to figure out the handwriting so
you know invent Inter National Day to
get people's handwriting and then send
over people whatever whole story all
right so
um we we got the handwriting was
analyzing if images you know doing
typical Samsung features uh split
screening you know analyzing
and of course we have like databases of
Serial offenders on the phone but not
like up every stud it would be nice if
we had handwriting
uh analysis applications on a mobile
phone I mean it be pretty easy just
scan and it can give me a I think like I
mean we do have face recognition running
off this phone really fast running on
device um unfortunately I didn't figure
out like someone with same color ha it's
actually different color it's the same
person uh but of course we have Cloud
applications for that there's no like
really cloud handwriting analysis like
there's one handwriting analysis
application but it goes on your computer
and you need to have like multiple
samples uh but most of the time when you
type that in it is
for what's it
called it's for like handwriting
analysis
from uh like depending on the way you
write it's supposed to figure out you're
poting out or something like that but
enough of that desktop mode we got to
talk talk about something I am
definitely an expert on and know tons
about ever since I launched a hop three
weeks
ago almost have 200 followers maybe have
200 followers now it's
been uh flipping like going up up and
down
um all right so as
a oh yes let's just let's just go
through here
hot take how many oh only got 20 views
on this I wonder how many clicks I got
who knows okay Heart Take here dresses
Okay are
inefficient however Instagram says that
dresses are I think good for clicks let
me check here let me check the
insights So within the past 30 days
these are insights dress not a dress I
think that's a dress I have no idea what
the heck that is okay let me check let
me see the full post maybe that's a
t-shirt well anyway our top post is AA
Harper in a dress but in my opinion
dresses are inefficient okay imagine
you're like oh my gosh you can't even
see it yeah there we go so our top post
is AA an address and I don't know if
that's address let show here top content
based on engagement
top five is also address most active
times okay start it post at 9:00 am got
that okay um anyway wait wait wait yes
dresses are inefficient okay first of
all you can't run in them you can't do
anything but I mean they works I mean
for AA I mean they work
um so that's that's good I was you know
thinking about this yesterday
and it's a whole different story about
that anyway yeah so in efficient and of
course I have a another fashion take
because
obviously uh I know a lot about it and I
was reading this article because I I
have to do like research to what the top
T inch are top T in of dresses which I
don't know why I mean they're they're
very very inefficient okay first of all
uh have you ever tried to run in that
like really come on second of all uh
like how on Earth are you supposed to
play football like I mean you could you
could kind of sort of play football and
like jeans and a t-shirt or jeans and
like addess
like like you're just supposed to stand
there and like walk slowly I mean it's
kind of inefficient for like every
everyday life um or even like regular
life like life life moves
fast um anyway I have to do resch for
this but feel I guess because is going
to keep putting AA and dresses I mean
since she's not a real person it's not
like she ever has to play football or
run or climb a mountain so you know the
clicks bring revenue and revenue is what
we need that's the four reason we
created who anyway uh since I was doing
research market research um and I was
trying to find out more about what um
fashion advice do is uh so I typed in
teen girl fast
and after a few minutes of reading I
concluded that team girl fashion is very
very dumb like I I I'm shocked okay and
I no this is kind
of off brand for us but I mean like I I
don't know what's half the clothes that
they wear called so I have to like look
it up this is a this is actually where
Google Circle to search should be useful
because if I see a picture I don't have
to screenshot image I can just
um so let me find let me find the
article I was reading about Teo fashion
I mean the outfits were Abominations as
an
expert okay I mean these are actually
terrible outfits like I am not putting
AA in any of these my gosh nope it
wasn't
this okay
um ah yes here here these were the 16
outfit ideas that I could have put AA in
and these outfit ideas were horrendous
and I'm not even talking about the whole
Evangel
this okay I don't really have time to do
all those
calculations leave that to got questions
uh I mean these outfits are just
aesthetically hindes
okay okay I mean that's decent but I
mean would that get clicks I don't know
I'm not an expert but I mean what
the what is
this
okay like this was the outfit that made
me made the post like
who
who who approved it okay first of all
which who's another thing okay as an
expert since three weeks of launching
the account okay for clothes like this
like so in my opinion you should pay
less for Less fabric but apparently this
would cost more than say a full shirt
that makes no sense from uh you know
cost to fabric Rao I mean it's great for
capitalism but I mean for a cost to Fab
ratio it been zero s but I mean what is
this hello oh okay anyway graphic
t-shirt okay that's decent but for the
AI oh you can't even see it okay for for
the graphic t-shirt but for the AI uh
generator so this this is what we
talking about I mean this this is an
Abomination all right graphic resarch
that's good for for like real life but
for AI it's kind of hard because the
graphics get kind of muddled
um colorful crop tough and drink like
really what is
this how is this top
16 I I I don't know how we even make it
to top 16 like how on can you have 16
different combinations okay look pants
and Sh I mean how many different ways
can you combine that how many different
ways are you GNA try to sell
that and then what is this what okay and
again this is literally the same thing
as two times up and again as I say my
logic should be this should cost less
than a full Shir because I mean this
thing has holes in it but you shouldn't
pay more for holes in my opinion um a a
shacket like what is this I actually I
should try to test that I wonder if AI
even knows what that is I'm gonna ask
for my uh a harer in a shacket whatever
the heck that is okay um let me type
this
in
Old which uh as an expert on jingi
language I'm assuming that means shirt
and jacket but that look
like why is this even a choice first of
all your pants no sorry shorts are
ripped in your are you supposed the
closest or zip it like it's
ambiguous okay and then dresses which I
mean they do well on Instagram but
they're absolutely horrendous like in
real life okay U graphic t-shirt and
this I mean that's I mean that's just
like normal dress I'm not sure how this
is you know top 16 um floral paint skirt
crochet top and
sandals okay I mean that's that that be
a good promps I guess you can try that
out
um denim short overalls okay actually
the one legitimately uh okay like how
much would it cost without the holes I
don't know why ripped clothing a cost
more and B is so popular
um midi skirt hoodie and combat boots
which according to this you can lowkey R
them all year round depending on how you
styled them again I'm an expert I have
like what are you supposed to wear
backward in the winter sideways in the
summer like the other sideways and
spring and like regular in
Fall another shacket which I mean this
the same thing and since when is looking
home being homeless style okay a f
leather jacket plaid pants and
boots okay that that'd be a good thing
all right here we go this is our AA
Harper without the face changing
software uh in a
shacket uhhuh which uh according to the
stuff on uh I mean the picture's fine uh
it would probably do well maybe like top
two according to the data cuz like this
I think this is a this shirt did well
and then it also did well here and then
of course you have the like other shirt
around it so it would probably do well
based on views and clicks
unfortunately uh it probably wouldn't
get approved according to the set rules
of uh the people um and the the
Christian got questions framework stuff
based on again I don't do the
calculations I just asked for ruls to
make because if I did the calculations
just n i
I cannot do those calculations okay it's
my look it's not my job to code your
acronyms it's not my job to do clothing
calculations and it's not my job to
decode hashtags the rest of the stuff is
fine okay I'll handle the tech and like
other Christian side stuff you guys got
questions in teenage Coalition can
handle that okay all I actually go
decode real codes you guys can decode
hashtags emojis and
acronyms um flannel shirt and jeans hey
that did well that did well so hey if it
did well on the AI yes it's well in real
life and that's number 16 okay me
honestly somebody these up withous and
yeah
also again looks like the same exact
stuff that they're selling online so I
guess I guess they're technically right
um about
that oh my gosh what is that anyway CET
CET I mean this this is an exclusive
report from CNET they're saying that the
iPhone 16 Pro is rumored to have thinner
screen bezels and according to an
exclusive the tech boy report per s is
close to Apple the phone is also tip to
have a battery and a screen okay I mean
we weren't sure about that but mean come
on the phone's going to have smaller
vessels you think really what what else
it's G to have a charging port it's
going to be made out of glass it's it's
going to have Titanium on the back it's
going to have three cameras I could have
told you
that all all the time they always have
smaller
bezels like okay think about it I since
iPhone 4 to iPhone 14 smaller bzel okay
they've had smaller bzel since the
iPhone 10 when they went from the8 well
seven I guess from the seven to the 10
and then 10 to 11 11 12 uh well from 10
to 10s 10s to
11 you get what I'm saying like they
always have smaller bezels just like
they always have screens they always
have cameras they always have charging
ports wait that that's not that's hardly
news like that be like me writing an
article
saying someone posted a video on Tik
Tok the Earth is
round my phone has a touchcreen like I
mean that that's that's hardly news it's
basically a
fact congratulations good for you I
guess
um
yeah let's see oh we got to talk about

me check my
bookmarks
where my bookmarks oh there they

help now okay un fortunately for us the
guy asking the question is actually one
of the smartest ones one of the first
answers he gets
is that's not something you can
teach it's actually about going with the
flow when you're both talking playfully
just UK so uh just be uh briten or maybe
it says just you know just go with the
flow ah yes yes well let me um try to
explain this into English uh do you

technique
okay um just be you uhuh yes of course
he's asking for
advice just be you go with the flow I
mean tell me that that is horrible
advice oh no I'm not saying I expert I'm
I'm a smart person I know that go with
the flow like what what's that even mean
um here's some more questions the kids
ask on here should I request to
Instagram snap quick versus what oh man
this English is terrible should I
request her on Instagram quick ad versus
in sorry having hard so I request her on
Snapchat quick ad versus Instagram I
don't know what quick ad is uh is that a
thing let let me check that out
snap because maybe quick add is a t
let's see quick add oh it's kind of like
that okay
okay I mean and this this is this shows
how much we have fallen as a nation I
mean personally I just add people on S
snap if I actually want to talk to them
yes yes kids
yes
Snapchat is the Premier chatting
application of Jin Z in my school that
is set because as we all know Snapchat
is the application that you use to um
take pictures of people at uh 3 in the
morning like I said phones like great
for Espionage and like o and stuff but
no no no no no cut that out cut that out
I mean we we can't actually you know do
anything productive on no no no no I got
to be up at 3: in the morning take up
take the perect snap of my messed up
hair in low light with my 2 megapixel
selfie camera up my nose see my nostrils
and take a picture and go
like and then I know people are like
actively scamming committing crimes on
Snapchat like come on come on that is
that is just like what's wrong with you
people like just sending pictures and
chatting people actually make money off
of that I mean it's so popular
no okay um here's some more
questions oh this actually seems like a
decent question like you know
International ESP someone trying to
break up someone else
thing
oh my gosh this question is so funny who
comes up with these
scenarios so about three weeks ago I
asked for lack of better WR a colleague
of mine and be my girlfriend as a joke
and then they doubled down then it
didn't work okay all right let's see
let's see what other questions there
are um let's let's Swit by
uh uh okay let's keep it going through
here
um what are the other dumb questions
that are on you
like all okay okay let let me read this
let me read this I've got a crush is the
uh this
the title so okay and of course everyone
here is aeric to um capitalization and
periods for some reason is like they all
got a virus this guy actually is nice
and get Mar at the end and he actually
his punctuation but you know all all
over case no periods so I'm 14m in my
crush and I think I Crush 14f which
that's an
achievement that's um likes me so we've
been snapping all day making conver
conversation and she's making
conversation with me what do I do next
now I'm no expert but if someone's
talking to you and you talk back to them
I mean that okay you're talking to
someone congratulations that's the way
conversations
work like so I'm talking to someone and
they talk back and then I responded what
did I do next I don't know wait for the
next response at least you got a
response and of course using SnapChat
because like I don't know SMS it's it's
not good enough anymore maybe actually
use an actual chat app that's
not a dog filter who knows
uh oh wait that that was me never mind I
almost read my own
question I got 168 comments on here
about my potential Mall Ting with mutual
allies

for on documents I I have nothing else
to do
wait religion stuff oh the question
isn't
deleted
so
yeah and uh sub is absolutely
trash unfortunately I can't find the AI
tool let me let me keep looking for it
it's on here
somewhere let me
check my
bookmarks they said have named it
something memorable like hack GPT now
that that would have been memorable look
my
bookmarks I know it's at the
bottom sociable

off um in terms of hacking knowledge all
right let's go back to the other
one I'm going to share it soon after I
sign in or sign up and as we're do this
here is the open AI thing I wanted to
tell you about
the
image here we go so they took this pizza
and then they changed it and edited it
by Chang making the topic circuit boards
and it turned into
Des nice computer
chips
see here's the
darling
GPT thing how much does it
cost all right I am signing into the
[Music]
