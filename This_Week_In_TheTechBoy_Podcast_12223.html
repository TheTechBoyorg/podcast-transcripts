<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 12223</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
the this weekend the chck boy uh oops
podcast today we have lot to talk to you
about about especially about from my
headlines and the video um reactions
today um oh and the Tesla cyber truck
came out so that's it's very interesting
um first let's share this thing on to
the website and every X and stuff like
that so's see copy link
address and we also got some new
products this week the Cobra walkie
talkies to test and I was able to take
them to the park today when I went
geocaching and unfortunately the
advertised range of two miles in the
city and 25 miles in the wilderness did
not work for me so yeah I started
getting I say about a quarter of a mile
I started getting static from the
testers at home
and obviously since we don't have 25
miles of wilderness to test out um um we
couldn't have fixed it like that so we
couldn't have tested that mode but right
now doesn't appear that the 25 nor the 2
Mile um radius appear to be active or
working now back to the specifications
on the
walkie-talkie we have a um micro USB
port a headphone jack and then there's
also Vox on here unfortunately uh Vo box
um and the microphone for the spies in
training
um only works when you put your mouth
within 3 inches of the microphone so you
cannot bug a room um with this
walkie-talkie and that's the person is
like talking right into said
walkietalkie um but for our buding spies
and training and of course our lovable
ENT researchers um we we do have a very
special here which I mean honestly
techboy has
been I mean winning based on these
article counts here where Samsung M M7
is no longer the number one most popular
article all over the place so Samsung
1ui 6.0 which we can talk about later
fixed and broke for secure folder um
but finding usernames and addresses with
with uh sub. rocks um has gotten
hundreds probably thousands of views now
um what is
that 120,000 of views now and this is
essentially software we can find
someone's addresses and in records Etc
just from a home just from an email
address it's completely legal it's not
um on the darket or anything and it's
called s.o. rocks and you can just type
in a email address or a VIN or a license
plate in here so honestly budding ENT
researchers I would highly recommend
this tool um they don't have anything
like more recent here so let's say I
tested some email addresses like from me
since I'm like younger and there wasn't
that much information there but for
people let's say over the age of 30 um
at least it should be there or if the
people have been involved in database
leaks it it should also be there
so so yeah
um I I think that this is a really
interesting tool and I would personally
use it for you know oent investigations
Etc and yeah so let's talk about oneui
6.0 um oneu 6.0 um is really nice in my
opinion it's been feeling fluid uh most
of the time it did get a bit hot today
it did lag up today but I don't know
what that was it could have been just
because I had a a day of editing for GNN
uh news video for school and the uh
video editors were taking out RAM and I
was just you know
taking space up or something like that
um like Ram space uh you know what I
mean
like and also the videos could have been
you know all the space in there but I do
like the remaster and object eraser just
come up when you swipe up now um the the
camera modes do feel a bit faster
and the camera modes feel a bit um
faster um in in my opinion like
switching between the L feels more fluid
I like the notification shade and the
new panel doesn't bother me I think it's
good you know um and then of course we
got one UI 6 support for the protecting
against OMG cables which we talked about
a few weeks ago however there are some
problems here so for secure folder we do
get a new scrolling vertical instead
of horizontal AB which whatever unfort
Ely we
cannot scroll the scroll
um the ab stings when you can see here
we can't scroll AB stings when to give
all those um so the bug where Chrome is
effective though is has been fixed so I
can have Chrome on both instances
working now but still I'm going to stick
with Edge
and
YouTube picture and picture is also
working as well also secure not secure
Pho oneui
6.0 um also brought in a new feature um
It upgraded the video editor it's it's
decent I I'd say but it's still linear
you can't add things really on top you
can't really add other videos on top
and that's yeah that's it for the
gallery application oh speaking speak of
gallery application the Samsung videos
application is being depreciated for
this version Android 14 of Android so
yeah that's kind of sad oh and just
personal news back I talking about
Android I am back to Android of of
course Android 14 with my widgets and
stuff I'm not using Microsoft launcher
anymore right now I'm using just regular
stock launcher for Samsung
and
yeah
so if anyone has any questions about
that um or we can get back into into our
first video which we're going to be
talking about
um um AI of course and the the Sports
Illustrated
thing and yeah I'm also happy to
announce or report that of course
keyboard
um keyboard not keyboard uh you know
connecting phone
via via USB still works unless of course
I have the OMG thing turned off of
course it's not going to accept
commands via USB but I think it will
transfer files via USB and good
Guardians and good luck the applications
do need updates they need updates to
like work with the new software for
Android 14 and one UI
6.0
but they
um yeah so they need they need the to
update for one 6.0 but most of the
features still work fortunately for
Samsung I did hear that Samsung isn't
including um what's it
called uh I don't remember what it's
called oh OLED like bur in protection in
the software I don't know why maybe they
don't think it needs it because they'll
be using it so many times or something
I'm not sure but it was kind of funny
that graphic that the Jerusalem Post um
showed for that article when they were
showing the article it was an image of
the Galaxy S7 Edge which is kind of
funny
because uh wouldn't be getting that
phone anyway
so oh wow that's a nice
background let's see let's see if I can
change another one
this is
orange
and oh here we
go that's a good background okay so yeah
um yeah so oneui 6.0 for a pretty good
update the camera
features you know stay the same but
there's like different toggles for for
12 megapixel and 50 megapixel mode on
the settings here transitioning between
the linges it seems faster
and yeah that's basically it for
pictures and videos oh oh there's now a
new stable stability bar on here kind of
like on the Google pixels and hello to
my first visitor here so but now we have
to um we're going to talk about this
video where we're going to talk about
SPS Illustrated got caught using AI
in what's it called AI
in
in oh oh in their articles yeah but
there's this this this thing this
problem the take of the video that to
and it honestly doesn't make any sense
from a technological and honestly a
legal point of view
so yeah yeah yeah yeah of course we're
going to show it on screen
[Music]
soon okay there we go U yeah yeah we're
GNA show this on the screen soon so we
just get past these
ads so it's muted and of course Mr who's
the boss ranked the the smartphones of
the the year so we got to talk about
that and then we'll talk about I guess
the Elon Musk released the Tesla cyber
truck and he apparently shot at it with
the Tommy Gun so that's that's
interesting I guess Miss see me just see
if this is the clip oh that's an
ad
okay here we go so we're going to start
at the two-minute Mark here we are
sharing the tab and let put it into d
mode so we have the full viewing
experience and we're just going to like
skip around a little bit when make sure
this showing on the screen yes it is all
right this draft uh not just little
videos like this but entire
articles and more than that the video
you sh in context is apparently a video
that didn't exist of Steph Cy they they
faked the video or something like that
but it's kind of they've been using AI
to create fake authors as well complete
with fake biographies
yeah I mean if they were doing that and
they admitt it to it I think I mean
that's fine in my opinion to have ai WR
an article with fake authors and fake
biographies um as long as you disclose
that it's AI like you just can't like
make up a person and not tell people so
yeah the outlet never disclosed any of
this to its readers obviously so here
for example is their biography of uh
somebody named Drew Ortiz who appears to
be a white male with brown hair and blue
eyes looks kind of like a normal guy
this is straight from Sports
illustrated's website says quote Drew
has spent much of his life outdoors and
is excited to guide you through his
NeverEnding list of the best products to
keep you from falling to The Perils of
nature I mean that doesn't make any
sense honestly like
none and if you look at the guy's face I
don't know if this is the you
YouTube no it's 720p so just be pretty
good I mean there's no detail or Texture
in it
hair at all apparently he's missing two
front teeth
interesting also I think this guy I mean
if you look at this if this thing here
he reviews Outdoors camping backyard
games hunting and fishing and then the
article that they show on the screen is
him talking about the best fing FS which
is hilarious you you'll see why
nowadays there's rarely a weekend that
goes by where Drew isn't out camping
hiking or just back on his parents' farm
that seems like obviously most of the
biographies that you read online are
stilted and fake like this but even by
that low standard Drew Ortiz's bio is a
little
suspect what does it mean to keep you
from falling to The Perils of nature
exactly it sounds a little bit morbid
and once you find out that AI was
responsible for it The Perils of nature
line starts to seem more than a little
bit creepy but you're not supposed to
dwell on Drew's biography instead you're
supposed to click on his articles
because that's how Sports Illustrated
makes money and once you do that once
you click the AI gen well yeah I mean
makes sense and of course here at the
tech boy we are upfront and honest about
our use of AI in articles in front it in
fact if this small computer would there
you go show here one of our top articles
was the uh one UI not one UI uh boosting
content creation and productivity un
leasing the power of AI with the tech
boy if you click through there you can
see how we use AI here now we've never
had AI like fully generate a story for
us however we have had AI like fix our
things here um we used to use CH GPT
co-pilot seems to working out great for
us too and it's easy just to click on
right over there so um we're going to
kind of take offense of what he's about
to say um here soon but here we
goated clickbait uh here's what you'll
find one of Ortiz's articles which was
originally published last year is
entitled play like a pro with the best
full-size volleyballs and the point of
this article is to advertise a series of
volleyballs so that Sports illustrat can
get a kickback when people click on the
links and the way he says that makes it
sound like illegal but all he's
describing is affiliate marketing which
is completely legal and we look to get
into it it um soon so yeah once once we
um you know eligible to pay taxes and
stuff buy volleyballs which is pretty
standard in digital media as you
probably have noticed the Drew Ortiz
artificial intelligence for its part was
tasked with writing a paragraph to
introduce I mean if you're just trying
to sell volleyballs I mean there's more
important things in the Sports World so
I guess if you wanted to hand over your
affiliate marketing Wing just to all of
AI I mean that that would be completely
fine like that'd be fine with that all
of these affiliate links and here's what
Drew came up with uh here's what the AI
came up with for one of the volleyballs
quote volleyball is one of the most
popular sports in the world and for good
reason it's fast-paced has a high skill
ceiling and is generally an exciting
sport to both play and watch okay okay
if they said something that's probably
true even people who don't watch sports
can easily understand the intensity and
skill required to play volleyball
whenever they watch
clips that sentence doesn't make sense
people who don't watch sports don't
really watch clips of
sports so but sure there's a reason why
it's been such a Mainstay in modern
sports to this day volleyball can be a
little tricky to get into especially
without an actual ball to practice with
now um for some some of you who don't
watch sports at all uh volleyball is
near impossible to play without set a
ball okay
um I mean it would be easier to play
volleyball with just the
ball and to not have a net okay you
could just draw a line in the ground but
without a ball and volleyball I mean you
you can't do much okay I notic this a
Tech podcast and some people are very um
shocked for some reason to find out that
I like sports volleyball is not like one
of my favorite sports but football is
but like I I understand the basics of
volley ball and they've played it
non-professionally like before like for
fun um it's new impossible to play
volleyball without you know set ball
like you can play it without a net you
just hit it over a line or something and
then you have a set height on a wall
um you can even play with just two
people but you kind of need to have a
ball to play volleyball the same thing
goes for football because if you don't
have a football when you're playing foot
football you're just basically playing
tag tackle Edition um same thing for
psycho well technically you don't really
need a psycho ball if you get one of
those H psycho balls and also for tennis
unless you get one of those like sharper
image of pingpong uh laser tennis
pingpong whatever uh projectives so yes
you you do need a ball for to play
volleyball um breaking news from techboy
media now up until that last line you
could see why somebody might be fooled
into thinking that Drew Ortiz is a real
person he comes across as maybe an
Earnest guy just trying to explain why
he loves volleyball in as many words as
possible but towards the end Drew enters
the uncanny valley by saying that
volleyball can be a little tricky to get
into especially without an actual ball
to
practice well that's kind of an
understatement Drew it's it's a bit like
saying water polo is hard to get into
without water or cooking is hard to do
without food it's a kind of I mean I
mean I'd say it's if I easier to cook
without food than it is to play
volleyball without a ball okay I mean
maybe you can play with the rock or
something I don't know that no human
being would ever actually say so
needless to say the AI like something I
would say
to oops known as Drew Ortiz wasn't
exactly producing the most compelling
copy we can assume that very few people
bought volleyballs on Drew's
professional recommendation and that
could be I wonder if there's a way you
can check I mean I know like if I look
for SI I could check the back end see
the affiliate marketing statistics but I
wonder wonder if there's a way that
public people could check because that'
be really funny um and nice to see how
the affiliate marketing came with that
terrible article why sometime this
summer Sports Illustrated quietly
replaced Ortiz with another Ai and this
time the name for the AI changed from
Drew or I wonder if they changed my
chatbot say they went from say Freedom
GPT the jet GPT or or co-pilot well it
didn't exist but let's say it did to Jet
GPT and then they replace it with the
woman or something like that or if they
paid for their own AI or built their own
in-house
AI to Sora
Tanaka who is Sora Tanaka well let's see
according to her biography on Sports
Illustrated website quote Sora has
always been a fitness Guru and loves to
try different foods and drinks she is
fond of
very again with the texture here in her
workouts and believes that everyone
should participate in some form of
physical or mental activity at least
three times per week why is the
exclamation work I just read that last
part again she believes everyone should
particip I don't know what that means by
participate in some type of physical or
mental activity hopefully mental
activity doesn't mean like you know
thinking for yourself because uh I I
participate in in mental activity like
all the time in as I'm in
and like I'm hyperactively planning
things
schoolwise Tech wise Etc um no Now menal
activity means like and this is not an
endorsement of the thing
so my current audience doesn't like flip
um like meditation I don't know if that
would be a a
mental engage and if by physical
if you mean like walking then yeah I'd
hope that you walk three times a week if
you mean like you know actual physical
like running biking mountain climbing or
something like that then sure so it
depends on how that sentence is being
read or
taken in some sort of physical or mental
activity at least three times per week
so talk about the soft bigotry of low
expectations we can infer from this that
AI doesn't exactly have a high opinion
of humans if this is the bar it's
setting for us I mean this lady does
sound like some random Fitness
influencer that you could find on YMCA
or I don't know like some food blog or
something like that enjoy his Fitness
and things that used to do this it the
way you know the way AA works you
scrapes the data from the internet and
basically tries to predict what's going
to come next so that's probably just
your typical lady blogger from a food
website or something like that that got
added to a sports website well typical
lady bloger from a Sports website they
got added to
Etc just use your body or your mind
three times a week is
all let's let's just start there AI is
saying to the human race and I'd like to
say I'd like to think anyway that robots
are underestimating us here but I don't
think that they that they are most
likely at this point it's important to
mention that Sports Illustrated didn't
just have ai generated articles and fake
biographies and fake writers they also
generated fake head shots for these WR
ERS they generated images out of thin
air for people who don't exist and who
they were claiming were writing articles
that were not written by any human at
all hey both Tanaka and Ortiz had that's
perfectly fine that's perfectly fine um
I've used it to like scam bait people
before like I generated a like on this
person does not exist.com you can
download an
image or screenshot actually because if
you download image that actually
downloads from the server which
refreshes so I screenshot image of like
a fake kid or something like that or
made one of the people into a kid or
something like that and then send it to
the person because they wanted to see my
license or something like that so I made
a fake license so yeah AI generated
images for the
work and uh these AI produced head shots
and we know that because the head shots
were available for sale on an online
Marketplace that sells AI head it's just
kind of
lazy you might as just buy like some
random head shot off of iock shots
because uh that's something that exists
now apparently so I mean that's
capitalism for the win think think about
that think about that AI generated head
such and you can pay for them that's a
genius plan think about it just type in
what you want onto the website
right or you just like buy a face off
the website and you just have different
categories buy gender and race and done
that's like smart and you you only have
to have like say a thousand of them host
them on a server right $4.99 and then
you charge say I don't know $5 per image
you'll be making insane amounts of money
depending on amount of traffic that you
get
that's I mean that's a great business
opportunity I mean we should have
thought of that and eventually after
they were confronted by futurism Sports
Illustrated took all these articles down
and what's futurism let's
see
yes I
am science technology news and videos
interesting I wonder how much um science
and technology is on the website you
know certain science and technology
websites um that shall be mentioned on
the podcast uh here we go report to
detect boy.org student science and
technology websites like I don't know
diverge yeah D
um forgot about you know talking about
science and technology go click the link
if you want to know more head shots down
and they scrubbed it all from their
website now in a statement the company
blamed a contractor for all this they
denied that the Articles were written by
AI although they didn't deny that the
head shot were AI generated so I guess I
mean true I guess it's a new way of
going
Anonymous or the people's like those are
real people whose pictures were taken
then they edited it with AI and fixed it
up and and like removed the background
with AI so I guess it' be like AI
assisted so there there is a way for
that they're claiming that there were
real people who wrote the articles but
they made up fake people to say wrote
them I don't exactly understand that
they also claim that editors carefully
review all the content that's uploaded
yes of
course so if if that is true then they
said fire the editors for the volleyball
article and the GU
bio okay that's all I'm and that's a
claim that several other websites and
media Outlets have made in the past when
similar things have surfaced about them
Cen that for example insisted that uh
while it was using AI to draft articles
editors were carefully factchecking
every detail prior to publication like
cette the Techo um as you can go click
through their article we don't generate
complete articles in so they type it in
because like CH
GPT is from 2021 so like if I wanted to
talk about say the s24 it's it's gonna
be like terrible if I might start
talking about like some pickup truck or
something like that
so we write our own articles and have it
edit it's basically like hyper Advanced
grammarly
um which is different than having AI
write your articles because they could
get stuff wrong there um now sometimes
AI may try to change the facts of the
Articles or change like the way the
articles are written but there's a way
you can tweak it into like adding
special instructions or you know my
little outro that we have like standard
for the tech point0 and says God bless
Tech talk to you and Tech talk to you
later tries to change it to something
that doesn't have anything to do with
God or something and changes Tech talk
you later to something else sometimes
we'll just leave that out
um yeah so that's completely different
not like mocking it I mean we've thought
about generating articles with AI um
before because sometimes there's not
that many things happening in Tech news
and we try to like produce at least two
articles um per week but if we were to
generate an article with AI we like do
it with fan be like hi this our first
ever AI generated um article however um
one thing AI is not satanic okay
so it's it's a computer book well how
did that work out a few months ago CET
published an article claiming that a
$10,000 deposit in a savings account
earning a 3% apy would would return
$10,300 in profit after the first year
which you don't have to be a math Wiz to
know that's off by about
$10,000 CET later appended a correction
to the article uh somehow this slipped
by the fact Checkers I don't know bank
rate one of CET sister site sites has
had the same problem they claim that
their editors carefully review AI
generated articles but these articles
are full of mistakes as well including
mathematical mistakes which is which is
the one thing you would think AI would
always get right but apparently um yeah
see this no Evin to him fan of him um
you don't that's not how AI Works AI is
trained on language so CH gpg is
actually not that good at math um there
might be other like better math based
AIS but it's more like being good at
English right being good at English
doesn't mean that you'd be good at
maths and vice versa
um
so
no they don't you know using the
internet go on to make random claims
about
AI a performance that truly
matters for each and every
one everyone can see this coming and
they know that it's bad labor where we
are now here comes our Tech reaction um
right now is to use just fire up the app
and click one button to get protected
your data is your business visit
expressvpn.com
Walsh show use my Link at expressvpn.com
cmat Walsh show so what do we make of
all this you know it's easy to mock
Outlets like CNET and Bank rat whatever
that is and Sports Illustrated which
nobody reads anymore but it's not hard
to see where this is all heading I we
are rapidly and willfully moving towards
a dystopian world where AI does
everything and oh no we're
not no we're not AI does everything okay
um you're going to need to have someone
to code fixa F the
AI Etc but moving on and most human
effort and labor has become
redundant okay what do you want me to do
about it ban AI everyone can see this
coming and they know that it's
bad um no everyone cannot see this
coming and no everyone does not know
that it's bad because no no one knows
what you're talking about yes you're
think that we're rapidly moving towards
a future where AI Control everything and
but you you just said three minutes ago
is um inside of like three articles
would it wasn't getting math right and
it wasn't getting like the facts correct
and had the grammer of a
two-year-old so I I'm I'm pretty sure
we're not rapidly moving towards a
dystopian
future but of course it seems like our
our ERS none of them have the fortitude
to do anything about it what what what
do you expect them to do about it okay
uh we have this nice little graphic here
um so yes techboy
2024 20
2044
um what what are you what are you
expecting me 20 years from now
um uh uh um to do about it ah yes that's
that's ban AI okay like how are you
supposed to get that law passed and AI
replacing Sports illustrator writers is
the least of our concerns in this regard
what of course of course happens when AI
starts replacing oh I don't know truck
drivers and uh ride share drivers uhhuh
yes that's not happening in in five
years okay um second of
all this argument could have been
made a 100 years ago when car start
first coming out let's say let's say
Wilson okay wro Wilson let's say
Roosevelt was like oh well cars cars are
going to replace the the um the horse
and carriage industry so we need to
regulate this or let's say
in in uh in
1948 the president said oh computers
computerss are becoming a thing now
um well is and that's going to put the
the female computer people who did
calculations like in their brain and on
like on paper you know out of business
so we need to regulate that let's say
rean in in the 80s was like oh the
internet um could become a thing
soon um and that that could put
newspapers out of business well I'm not
saying he probably would have said that
because it's it wasn't really thing
let's say more Advanced Computers you
what what are you
expecting okay technological
advancements Drive
chains right and they may put people out
of business but of course they'll create
new jobs and I can guarantee you that
truck drivers 50% of truck driver ders
at least will still have their jobs 5
years from now and will not be replaced
by AI okay um level I think it's level
four level four self driving has not
been attained yet I believe um and
especially for truck driving
which probably won't happen yet
especially since like for trucks drive
it it's cold and electric vehicles don't
do that well in the cold
[Music]
um
it so no
Okay no Okay so back to our graphic here
um yeah so techboy
2044 um I I don't think that my campaign
is gonna be let's ban AI because that
makes literally no sense at all um and
if every president ban technological
advancements as they were coming in
because they might theoretically take
jobs from people too fast um then then
we wouldn't be the country we are today
like if Wilson banned cars if Reagan
banned
computers right Bush banned the internet
or like heavily regulated it then we
wouldn't
be where we are now you probably
wouldn't even be able to hear me or see
me cuz we'd have a super regulated
internet we keep the newspaper publishes
in business or or like if if automatic
milk machines were banned or regulated
then we wouldn't a have as much milk
which is important I guess and B we
wouldn't if it's just to keep milk goose
in business like they can still have
other jobs like people will still have
other jobs and it will be a gradual
phase you're not going to go to bed one
day and you're a truck driver and the
other day all the truck drivers are
replaced with AI driven you know robots
say that you need thousands of trucks to
replace the current Fleet the current
Fleet which it's still like capable
they're not going to replace them with
brand new AI electric grid trucks in
that state you
know the old trucks are dying or they're
forced right back to the video
these are jobs that a significant
portion of the American middle class
depend on in order to survive what
happens when weo and Cruz and Tesla
managed to perfect their self-driving
AIS what happens then and we're not
there yet of course uh it'll likely be
several more years until AI is capable
of doing any of that and it's still
possible we'll eventually elect leaders
in time who will do something to prevent
the potential destru likeu of millions
of jobs in this country all like
what
like like what please please I would
like you to lay out a plan in
which what kind of law you g to write
you cannot use AI to supplement 25% of
the business like computers internet
right let's say I'm a researcher in the
1980s okay um who has to like go to the
library and stuff like I hire a
researchers to do research for me um now
I probably don't have to do that or they
you have to research on the computer
right um what are you expecting this
happens all the time when the first car
came when the cars came out the hor the
horse and cars buggy people went out of
business but they were able to get you
know drive cars I don't see what kind of
law or or legislation that could be
implemented that would save the jobs
without without you know like just
outright Banning
Ai and banning AI would be a very bad
thing for society since it's like
embedded in everything and I'm not
talking about the AI that you see like
you know Google B chat GPT the AI here
in Google search I mean the AI behind
the scenes that's been happening now
okay um three days ago it was chat gpt's
birthday and that's basically the uh
when the AI craze happened in in
November of 2022 but do you think AI was
invented in on November 30th 2022 people
were like oh AI wow no it wasn't
invented you've had it for a long time
that's just when it became popular and
people were were surviving in 2021 okay
not that good of an example because Co
okay people were surviving in 2019 and
in 2018 and AI existed okay um
robots existed okay there's technology
existed I'm pretty sure there a chat
boot out there that existed in 2016 uh
Microsoft released a AI bot that was
trained off of Twitter data and then
they took it down because it became
racist or something but still that's
proving the point that AI uh existed you
know back then it just wasn't in the
public Consciousness I mean AI it's far
back to say 1987 and a bite of
applesauce is mentioned when when uh you
Mr whu were talking to to Mabel which
fictional but I mean AI was known about
back then
so it just became popular due to chat
GPT being released November 30th happy
birthday chat GPT and probably because
Tik Tok
was you know it was getting promoted via
Tik Tok because millions of students
were using it to cheat on their
dbqs all at once which is where this is
headed
of course like I said all the jobs will
not be all replaced all at once that's
insane you know how I know that because
you're already predicting it right so
these people they they have like a time
to prepare for the AI apocalypse which
will not
happen in the meantime it's it's
important to look closely at the jobs
that AI is capable of replacing right
now and what that says about these jobs
and our culture at large at the moment
no it says doesn't say anything about
our culture okay here's what it says
okay the job that is able to replace are
English level jobs okay driving is
infinitely more complicated than writing
a sentence about how Patrick Mahomes
passed for 200 yards in the last game on
Sunday okay that's that's facts right
there
um
AI is trained on the vast data of the
internet okay so if a AI is basically
just replicating the style in which
humans WR so if I say write a sports
article about CJ St in chat TPT it's
going to give me a college article
because
2021 but if I say that it's going to
write with in the style of which humans
right basically as an aggregate of all
human Sports writers all time input it
into space in based optimized optimized
for CEO boom and publish doesn't say
anything about our culture or journalism
or anything like
that you know it's hard to deny that
journalism and sports journalism in
particular has become so vacuous and so
pointless that it can easily be replaced
by robots and most readers don't even
notice well yes like I was saying
because it's trained upon the data that
you put out there
right so if if Sports writing was better
in his opinion then the AI would be
better because it's trained upon the
data which is inputed this is a
fundamental disconnect on how AI
works okay so you put in something good
by typing good stuff on the internet
you'll get out something good from the
AI because it's trained based on that
same internet
data it it's generally not a good thing
to replace human jobs with AI I'm
generally opposed to
it I'm neutral I guess I mean it would
be unfortunate if my job got replaced
via AI unless of course I made the AI
myself when I'm still making money
but
like there'll still be jobs you
know out there in new jobs will be
created because of AI like now there's
this new job called a prompt generator
which you get paid to help generate
great prompts for chat TPT so AI is
creating the probably the same amount of
jobs that it's destroying and right now
truck drivers are safe okay but in the
media the point is that so many of the
humans doing these jobs are already
barely human as it is so it feels more
like a like a lateral move and this
isn't just happening at Sports
Illustrated and seen that at Bankrate
it's happening at all the various tiers
of garbage journalism including gaming
journalism the website Kotaku uh Now
features a few AI written articles
Microsoft start which is the homepage
that Microsoft presents to to uh users
of its internet browser recently
featured
an you forgot it name obituary with this
headline Brandon Hunter useless at
42 now this is a former NBA player who
died suddenly and and that's the
headline that the AI went
with I mean
it's
it's if they're going for the point of
of
ads and um and
clickbait it did its job so he's not
dead he's quote
useless which is sort of true in a
literal sense I suppose but that's not
how humans typically look at death uh
you would what kind of AI systems are
they
using like what AI system are they using
that generates these
headlines like this just seems like bad
Ai and I just hope that we wouldn't look
at it that way but Microsoft maybe the
biggest tech company on the planet
what
bro you just just called Microsoft the
biggest tech company on the planet yeah
um no offense to you but seeing as you
don't understand how AI
Works nor do you understand how Tech
journalism Works nor you do you
understand how augmented reality Works
we've gone over that in the suu as a
short about
this I don't think that you're
qualified to um speak about this besides
like 1% of people use Microsoft EDS okay
no one was affected by that okay and
half the percentage of people that use
Microsoft Edge is people who get it
pre-installed on their computers and
they don't know how to reset it so
they're like all over 70 and they
probably don't even read the thing on
the
edge so no offense but
uh I I I just don't know if you're
qualified to be talking about a no I'm
not qualified but you know I'm I'm a bit
more Quantified than than this just just
saying promoted that story and here's
the amazing thing it didn't cause any
kind of stir at all you probably well
yes because 1% of people use Microsoft
uh B like if AIO is on beinging it will
not cause a St they didn't even hear
about it that's because it's on beinging
and beinging is bad not because it was
on AI because we're used to this we are
no if I saw his headline across the news
that
said someone someone is useless age 42
that would be a headline okay but since
it's on beinging and it's on edge no one
cares we take it for granted that
whatever garbage we read was either
written by a poorly programmed AI or it
was written by some liberal arts
graduate with no life
skills no we take for granted is that
none of us use Edge that's what we take
for granted either way we don't take it
seriously it's just because it was on
edge
noise the bar is so low that it's
impossible to be outraged by uh by any
of this indeed it's hard to be outraged
by the quality of pretty much outrage
someone ex you edge okay it's a joke Ed
Ed is f anything mass produced uh at
this point especially produced for Mass
consumption the tech boy is very very
valuable as is is a is a
American run uh
company take popular music for example a
few days ago an AI singer songwriter
using the name Anna Indiana went viral
on social media with a a song that this
AI produced oh yeah I saw that the song
wasn't it wasn't good wasn't bad I mean
music it's honestly in my opinion
overrated I this
I mean I'd rather to listen to a podcast
but like it so I'm not the best judge of
music I guess I mean if it was a
Christian song I'm sure we would made it
to Keys for Kids radio so that's good I
guess and here's how Anna Indiana
introduced herself and and followed by
uh the songid I think it's a very
interesting application of AI to think
about sink a voice sink a face sink a
background
very impressive so it's it's one small
step for AI one lar step for AI kind I
guess hello world my name is Anna
Indiana and I'm so excited to share my
music with you No One Believes this is
real she looks like a a painting come to
life this looks like was made mid
Journey
uh okay here we go here's my first song
betrayed by this town as an AI singer
songwriter everything from the key Tempo
chord progression Melody notes Rhythm
lyrics and my image and singing is
autogenerated using AI I hope you like
it and look you see the code here for
the MDI key and everything here um face
isn't
symmetrical like
that's a line right there I'm pretty
sure that's like a two degree line and
that's like more you know normally
curved so fix that um the
background looks like a zoom
background and unfortunately they're
using a Max that's you know it's
probably the
[Music]
problem uh I don't know about this do
social media Stars normally blink that
much and start looking around I'm not a
music video expert and in most music
videos well not most music videos but
like music videos that I've seen it's a
bunch of people jumping around
and like switching things every two
seconds like by a car or something I
don't know
it sitting at my favor Cafe sipping my
tea it's Satur
thinking okay I mean that sounds like
some song you he like walking through
the mall she she doesn't like pause and
the AI did get some interesting details
here with the earing pause thing there
interesting f post
um
don't know what that
was interesting uh yeah there's this TV
show called Saturdays totally different
random like tangent thing here um yeah
it's it's allegedly a comedy and I don't
think I've ever oh I laugh one time and
and then they also have this episode
about old technology where it's like
have a fax machine or something that's
good funny yeah he's done to everyone
WI a Grammy probably
[Music]
not oh let's look at the code here um
expert songwriter new hit song for
lyrics titled song mood song topics
example
lyrics screams somebody please
help me sing topnotch No is it good
enough to go into a a mall and if you
like I don't know modulate a bit make it
more space it out like would it be like
if if you gave six more months to
development would it be good enough to
go into Mall yes but the video doesn't
matter it's decent background
[Music]
music let tear it down back voice can
you some work but the back background
like the just the music like say you Ed
AI to extract your voice delete it just
get the music perfectly fine it's not as
upbeat I mean I think in malls you might
want more upbeat songs because then
people might get more distracted might
buy something more just is more like
sleeping music but I guess since he's in
the cafe it's fine because the the warm
drink the warm drinks make you sleep oh
yeah because didn't like they all give
warm milk to uh the bad guy struck a
head in them yeah struck a thing in his
head
Bible and like it's a song so the lyrics
don't actually have to make you know
sense okay that's what I've learned from
from hearing songs that the lyrics
actually don't have to make sense so I
don't really care what she's saying
she'd be singing about fish jumping into
burritos I mean there's literally a song
called pink fluffy unicorn jumping on
Rainbow so we we've heard it all here so
songs don't really have to make sense
that's like a rule of
songs all the
trade okay who takes an electric car
into the forest and desert in the
mountains and the Prairies and The
Valleys
[Music]
um no one does that okay because there
are no Chargers out there
now needless to say kill it with fire uh
the song is bad and Bland and creepily
lifeless it's also quite ominous ai's
idea of a fun pop ballad is a
lamentation about the pointlessness and
futility of
existence isn't that like every song
though like like I'm saying AI good in
good out bad in bad out okay isn't every
pop song and I am not an expert here and
let's get set this up for clip for minut
all here we go isn't every pop song just
about some girl breaking up with their
boyfriend yes or no uh put that
into uh
poll quoted the centy right
there just yes or no honestly tell me I
I wouldn't
know
so yeah so I mean followed by a call for
us to tear it all down
that that also sounds normal um
recording a sec music which I couldn't
tell you five songs if you stuck a gun
in my head unless you got Christmas
songs
um
yeah okay let's
see
okay let's type this then isn't
every we're going to end this soon um
we'll we'll react to
the uh
uh the the the phone of the Year
thing
um stupid auto
correct oh my
gosh G
wh
what
okay here we go we we'll react to to the
phone video later so the robots are once
again not trying to hide their disdain
for the human species again um AI cannot
have disdain for
something like
it it's a computer program okay I think
that I think we're losing sight of this
that it's a computer
program but then again you could point
out the mainstream music industry also
hates the human spe species and also has
mainstream music industry does not hate
the human
species
well the ones
curently
now he talking about abortion but
like the mainstream music industry does
not hate the human species okay and we
probably have the same amount of
expertise here as in he only listens
to what's it like
not popular music and I only listen to
Christian Keys for Kids radio so we're
probably tied here um on our knowledge
and expertise but seeing guys I I'm I'm
pretty sure that the mainstream music
industry wouldn't hate the people that
are you know like paying for their CDs
has been for decades churning out its
own for decades of course okay so people
buying their
records their eight track tapes I don't
know how many f decad he's going me
decades could just been since 2000 which
would be CDs I guess cassettes is C are
going out like the last call the
cassette tape holder thing at player was
in 2009 it was Alexis so on bad and
Bland and creepily lifeless content now
to be fair fortunately I should note
that on social media a lot of people
gave negative reviews to that particular
performance but there are
congratulations to social media I guess
we're taking votes from them now I guess
they they count now plenty of examples
of soulless AI singers that have gotten
a lot of Praise recently here's um maybe
better okay we never buy bought set AI
Johnny Cash singing a Taylor Swift song
for example this was uh everywhere on
social media a few weeks ago be chined
off of and I've never heard the real guy
so I've also never heard probably never
heard to take this s song so I'm going
into here probably the most Clean Slate
of all clean slates so I'll just tell
you if the music's good or not oh and
most people loved it
watch Hello I'm not Johnny
Cash so it's going to be
forever or it's going to go down in
flames you can tell me when it's
over if it sounds like a good what's it
called country song and I don't know
what song He's thinking
so sure now of
course Matt's probably predisposed to
dislike Taylor Swift songs and he's also
pretty supposed to dislike AI not sure
about his views on cash so it's two for
one so yeah I was wor pain got a long
list of EX lovers they'll tell you I'm
insan correct right cuz you know I love
the players and you love the game cuz
we're young and we're
Reckless we'll take this way too far
it'll leave you
breathless or with a nasty scar got a
long list of EX lovers they'll tell you
I'm
insane but I've got a blank space baby
what what is that even what I th write
your
name so there it is and that got rave
reviews for the most part people didn't
well yeah it sound you know decent on
the lyrics and the song I don't know
what whatever but sure you care that
they were hearing the voice of a dead
country music legend singing some of the
most vapid lyrics imaginable they
embraced it in fact there were people
who it's not a it's not a crime or a sin
unless you know don't like the lyrics
which unless you think the lyrics are
sinful which I don't
know even said that they preferred that
to Johnny Cash's original
songs and that's why we can be certain
that eventually nearly all of the
content we consume on the internet and
nearly every movie and show we watch and
song we listen to will all be generated
by AI look if the content is good what
do you care I'm pretty sure 50 years ago
you would have said oh I'm pretty sure
the whatever the content's good why does
it matter in my
opinion besides you still need someone
to make the prompts I guess like that's
that's where this is headed okay what
you want me to sign a
law sign a law like what 50% of every
website's content must include human
generat content or something like that
the te the technology is getting more
advanced while at the same time the
humans who produce most of this content
are getting dumber and more vacuous
well I guess in
a in a way for you that would be good if
this is true the humans are getting
dumber and the AI is getting
smarter we're going to come to a
middling ground right if humans produce
worse content and the ai ai is trained
on that worse content then the AI will
do
worse which is I guess you have to go
the back to people who died because who
the voices a better for something I
don't
know so this is the process where humans
and AI are essentially meeting in the
Middle where the two become IND
distinguishable now I don't think that
AI will ever be able to write a book
like the Lord of the Rings or make a
movie like The Godfather or compose an
original song to match Beethoven but
that's not the kind of art that we
consume
these whoa okay I've never seen or read
the lord of rings of godf I've heard the
be Beethoven before and the reason we
don't really consume bethoven anymore
not so so sure about the other ones I
think the wings is like a whole bunch of
ages so why um it's because bethoven
lived hundreds of years
ago days we watch Marvel movies and we
read short blur we read short blurbs on
the internet we listen okay to canned
pop music I I don't know what can pop
music means okay sure okay it's pop
music as in popular now and PR bethoven
would be classified as pop music when he
was making music his music that was
popular when he was making
it
right and AI will certainly be able to
produce all of that I mean it already
can almost yep so we have a very
interesting thing here and unlike him
I'm gonna say that humanity is going to
survive so yeah congratulations Humanity
you'll survive we'll make
it um yeah AI is probably G to be what
oh yeah we'll be we'll be okay uh any
questions from anyone here no no
chats all right God bless Tech talk to
you later and hopefully we don't get
destroyed by
AI</pre>
