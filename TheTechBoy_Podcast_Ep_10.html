<h1>TheTechBoy Podcast Ep 10</h1>
<pre>testing oh wait sorry sorry
hello this is the tech boy and welcome
to the this week in the tech boy podcast
episode number 10. I accidentally
previously recorded this podcast with a
special guest but unfortunately I forgot
to record the audio so it's a waste that
we can't use unfortunately
um we've been discussing Google pixel 7
the Motorola Razor uh and the Z flip
four
uh and he actually was just about to buy
the pixel 7 upgrading from his iPhone
12. so that was the first person
essentially to switch from iOS to
Android on a
this weekend the tech boy episode
podcast all right we're just going to
get right into it
um that was basically disgusting that we
were going to have so I'm just gonna do
a slight recap
maybe play a sound effect and leave all
right we did the xiaomi event we did the
Google event the TVs uh finally got
posted walkie talkies let me let you
know the assume foreign
of course
um unfortunately he said that my font
headphones made me sound like a fish
which is kind of weird
um oh I have to tell everybody the
Samsung M8 M7 review had a slight Arrow
it does not support Google Assistant
um but the rest of the article was good
all right this is our article of the
week I am a teenager I do not use tick
tock using Facebook website it's bad
Robert agreed with me
right
um the xiaomi launch we didn't really
cover that one as much we didn't know
what's going on all right and I found
out I went live no one wanted to recap
so we didn't do one for this one uh
other people might do this instead if
you want one tell me I write it just
need one person who wants it uh well I
guess two I guess Robert wants it we'll
see uh latifus or a 19 we retested the
veins had better end it got about 900
feet before I had to go home so
that's not the official it's almost a
thousand feet exit we could have gone
400 but I had to go
um Google pixel 7 the watch it looks
bezel-less it's not the pixel 7 Pro I
mean it's a nice phone but I really wish
it had features like decks or something
like that I'm looking to upgrade my
phone and I want a phone that has
something like that uh in Motorola's
case ready for
so
I mean that'd be nice unfortunately the
Motorola Edge Pro is not
I mean Motorola Edge isn't sold on my q
u so
just the Motorola
we know the Motorola Edge is sold just
not the Motorola Edge but all right and
as I'm saying if you guys want to see a
pixel 7 on you Indiegogo
it's about you
unless I either win one from Google uh
yeah here we go Indiegogo you know what
that is all right
um I guess next podcast will re-record
with uh Robert thanks for watching and
Tech talk to you later
right no sound effects today guys wait
wait come on
bye</pre>
