<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 71523</h1>
<pre>everybody and welcome to the this week
in the tech boy podcast I hope you all
are ready for
um to start in three
two
one hello and welcome to the tech boy
This Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
hello everybody Welcome again I hope
that you all have been enjoying your
weekend
and now we are live so we have plenty to
talk about today
um
the tech boy put out plenty of Articles
um
we said
um
plenty of Articles
um so I'm going to share those with you
right now
hopefully you guys can see this on the
screen
oh
there we go
and here we go so first we're going to
talk about websites being graded in
mobile apps and Instagram threads
right and as I'm doing this I'm going to
share my uh articles
I mean links the link to this channel
hopefully you guys are coming in
trickling in and of course we'll answer
your questions
um if you'll come into the comments have
comments or consent
all right I'm sharing sharing sharing
if I said hi to someone just to share
for me
oh and speaking of hiring someone our
anniversary is coming up two weeks from
today mark your calendars 7 29
. you know
July ish July we were July 30th so yeah
7 29 2023 that's when the first article
is written
100 people
let's see if we can get let's see if we
can do that 100 people and if we do 100
people in a live stream simultaneously
um we'll see if we can get a prize uh in
I'll see if maybe I can get a prize and
speaking of prizes Prime day just
happened and I know we'll get to the
Articles we'll get to do articles but
Prime day just happened and we
used to
so having some loading issues if it's
the TCL
40 XL that's right the 40xl
um let me get this hot spot on just in
case that Wi-Fi knows that we would not
want that to happen on a live stream
anyway
um websites are greater than mobile
applications so the reason I wrote this
article and sorry for saying so at the
beginning of the sentence the reason I
wrote this article is because Instagram
threads the fastest growing app in the
world at least on Google Play over I
think it's 100 million downloads let me
check
um but over 100 million dollars that's
what we're going to go with right now
until I get proven wrong
gonna be innocent to approving guilty
50 million downloads into Play Store so
probably 100 million downloads across
both stories only has a mobile
application if I'm going to go to the
threads
like
website it just leads you to a QR code
that
well right it leads you to a blog post
from meta so Instagram threads
50 million downloads in the App Store
probably 50 million dollars I mean in
the place for probably 50 million
downloads in the application store from
Apple and this is why applications I
mean websites are better than
applications first of all websites that
can be accessed by anyone if
if I had a website well I do have a
website sorry I have a website right you
can access it on your cell phone you can
access it on your laptop you can access
it on your
um
desktop computer you can access it on an
Alexa Echo Show 5.
you can even access it on a smart watch
uh Galaxy watch 5.
an application
I mean you you may not only be able to
access it on Android iOS
Blackberry Symbian I mean sure they're
emulators that can
run stuff for you but it's just not the
same
and also an application where clients a
user to go in and do something and
people are lazy and they may not take
that extra effort and hello to the two
people watching me they may not take the
extra efforts to um
do so
you have to go in download maybe if they
create an account website just go in
Click you get your content
and I think that Instagram is losing a
big Market shoe like Instagram
a web application and you can upload
stuff
social media managers in actual job
that can go into their computers they
can edit their thumbnails and little
images and videos and wheels on a
desktop computer
export and upload instead of having to
edit them those Instagram upload type
tip to type in email or send the
snapdrop or airdrop or phone drive or
whatever and speaking of snapdrop and
airdrop and all of that we're going to
be reacting to
some
all right in the comments who do you
want me to react to MKBHD Mr bosses iOS
17 video in the comments right now
um but speaking of that yeah and this
this is looking bad for Trent right I'm
not saying applications are bad there's
certain applications that are just
better than the desktop counterparts and
it makes it because they have a desktop
app and they have a mobile app okay
that's YouTube
for the browser on your phone Soho mail
on the browser on the film on the phone
Twitter
um
also that's a problem there too
you can only use spaces on a phone which
is
stupid
oh yes yes okay look I can either do
spaces on my phone but you know a
microphone or I could get a professional
microphone in speaking to that and have
a more professional Life podcast
second of all
like Instagram itself
half Bates on the web
fully fixed now the reason that we have
applications
it's easier to take get the amount of
data
from an application then this and you
can't find a deeper integration with
apis into the settings
but come on they need to have at least a
Bare Bones basically like you should be
able to post something on threads from a
desktop I'm not defending Drake but I'm
saying
in meta's benefit you you should be able
to do that
it would be two day benefit
and of course we have seen aim at the
end of questions so
on computer I mean phones this is
sometimes how I'll accidentally leave a
comment
oh and it's going to be sending into
it's in the live chat now
um the reason that is because the MP is
over the
question mark key if you actually zoom
into the image here you can actually see
the question mark key is right there
that's on gboard and it's our most
quarterly style keyboard on Android and
that's just how it looks so if the m key
is over the key and the middle seconds
don't time out uh like I'm typing too
fast that's how it will load so
what's that and then Chrome launch the
reader mode button you can see that and
of course oh I forgot about nothing yeah
um the nothing phone which I was
mistaken the nothing phone has a better
chip than the chip in my snap in here
it's more power efficient so that's good
but let's talk about that
let's talk about that we're going to
play this game it's called the I have
600 and we're going to build a cell
phone and I want people to in the chat
to play along with me and remember we're
going to be reacting to the iOS 17.
beta videos eat it from MK PhD or ID
uh Mr Boss in the comments vote on that
but as I'm talking about that we're
going to put in the I have 600 and I
want to make a phone
um game so let's start off the OS
obviously Android okay we're not gonna
it's because money costs it costs a lot
many different osis I'm going to start
with Android
okay
um
now what do you think do you think we
should do features or no no features
like are we gonna skin it are we just
gonna have a smoothed kind of pixel like
experience
aside from Ai call screening stuff
all right I like features I have Samsung
so let's go with features okay we're
gonna do the decent level Port selection
okay we're gonna have a headphone jack
we're gonna have a micro SD card slot
and we're going to have USB video apps
okay
now we gotta skimp on some stuff we're
gonna have a 6.5 inch screen
and now we're going to get to the stuff
that we're going to skip to oh hello
zero one zero one zero one b e
oh um that question I was demonstrating
why M sometimes comes up in articles
um at the end of questions I'm going to
link that into the chat
you can read why that happens I was
demonstrating for the audit but welcome
so we're gonna have a 6.5 inch screen
and then we're gonna have to skip so
we're going to have an
end screen finger scanner but it's going
to be uh what's called the camera one
it's gonna be the camera not ultrasonic
and speaking of cameras we're gonna have
two times tally no no macro no death
none of that junk
and maybe like a 50 megapixel shooter
and we're gonna make it out of plastic
and maybe ipxfx five and speaking of
cheap phones we got to talk about that
new one plus Norwood CE because
for 2.99 it has some some of it some of
its specs are actually better than my
s22 plus but it would be a side grade
for me to get that apart from battery
life I'm pretty sure the battery life on
that display
actually my camera's better sure I have
decks but they
that phone has
you know decent camera uh 50 megapixel
uh wireless charging I think a good chip
16 gigs of RAM enough storage a USBC
um
it is in a different leak like crutches
to pixel 6 I mean seven only reason to
get the 7A hot take care is if you want
the AI features like the Google
integration or event with a smaller size
and I guess the camera maybe but if you
want Power if you want
style it's very stylish if you want size
you want a good family I that is a good
mid-range tone and for 299 on Amazon
I would recommend you buy that thing
three use software support for use
security to last you
really good time I want to get my hands
on it and maybe I'll buy one hey if you
want to support the channel there's
always step by me a coffee but back to
uh
uh smartphone so we have a generic 6.5
inch screen each of the maximum loose
right head from Jack markers D Card
plastic body and we're going to
basically making the OnePlus node c e
um
but everything can't be good everything
cannot be good and everything is not
good over at met her Meta Even though
they have about 100 million download
um on both platforms on that on
platforms combined they have
unfortunately unfortunately depending on
what you like
um or going down the gutter
um let me find the article
ETA
yes there we go from that being
hopefully you can see this user
engagement has on drug strides has
dropped off a cliff from Commodore
Vander built all right so user
engagement has created from people
spending time on the application for 50
from 20 minutes to eight minutes
analysts found eight minutes
from 20 which is not that much time
comparatively
and it's only been like the first week
so in the first week people have given
up on threads oh got a question
um
okay we'll get to that
um
people left to it but we'll get back to
that and zero one zero one b e says I
want a new I miss my any new phone bad I
miss my Blackberry and all different
from Walmart Wonder that's not 5G and
has a removable battery
why not 5G what's wrong with it
um
but we'll we'll find you one right now
live but there was a feature on Android
obviously it's gonna have to be Android
um where you can just turn off 5G and
only use a 4G connection
so that
um and a removable battery so probably
not 50. so there's the uh
it was the Fair phone and I'm assuming
you don't really care about specs
because
but you you can tell me what do you
think what do you want so that's the
fear film
okay he or she says T-Mobile associate
only only spoke on cameras on the phone
so it has to be a phone from T-Mobile
okay so we can get an unlocked phone the
fail phone is unlocked I don't know if
you can import it I don't know where you
live
uh
yeah so that's an unlocked phone you can
import
um I'm pretty sure it's unlocked
um let's see Furniture removable battery
so we're gonna have to go a little low
here low it mid-range here
oh
I'm sensitive to radiating with medical
condition okay
um there's the oh and you are in the US
all right so there's this pure Linux
from there's some Linux phones you can
buy
116 gigabytes
um
so let's see
so there's some Linux ones you can buy
do you care if it's an Linux or Android
and as you're loading just the pure OS
phone
okay it's loaded with POS
it looks like this so here it is
um
and you can run these operating systems
I think it's removable battery let's see
hello my stromo YT
and he says he doesn't know if he want
if he cares if it's in the next one so
what do you do on your phone
yeah here it is 45 for 4500 milliamp
hour usually replaceable battery and as
you guys are coming in MKBHD or Mr Boss
that show will reacted
um so here we go here's the option for
you you can look into it
if you don't really care if it's Android
and then
let's do Android just to be on the safe
size side sorry just because it's
probably easier and you'll get more
support
also I would like to not be forced to
use Google with untamable options are
you talking about the search engine
because on Android phones you're not
forced to use a Google search engine
this you.com there's Bing there's
uh DuckDuckGo you can always download
those applications and if you don't care
about Google then you can always
download Outlook or some privacy focused
uh email provider
so let's see oh that's from AliExpress
you don't like that
oh
what about oh okay yeah um the Motorola
E6 that looks like a good option let me
make sure it doesn't have 5G it's on
Amazon
and it doesn't matter if the phone's a
little bit older
there you go
75 on Amazon oh but it's carrying a lot
to provide some prepaid and it's only 14
so it's a moto E6
we're looking for an unlocked version of
the Moto E6 all right he says he likes
older models okay do you like what you
see on the screen
here's the Moto E6 16 gigabytes of
steroids story black oh wait
I forgot to snap okay
um
here we go right here Android 9 Moto E6
no 5G
black 16 gigs of memory
for 75 dollars
I put the link in the comments
um now let me warn you it's going to be
a bit slow
and it's running an old version of
Android but the battery isn't moving
forward and it doesn't have 5G support
and of course you can always turn off 5G
support So this
and of course there's Nokia
hello nngs
haven't seen you on the channel before
welcome welcome
and zero one zero one be says thanks and
oh it just looks good this one looks
better
it's a Nokia
iPhone 7 inches Android 10 go from 2020
supports all the qus let me share it
with you
all right there you go
foreign
can be showing off how you can turn off
5G well I only connects it different
back to our story threads dredge is
cratering dredges cratering you're
making a Nokia before that's great
that's great and if you haven't seen my
video about the Nokia 33 1 3G from
2017. don't get that phone by the way
it's uh spoken
um
check it out on my YouTube channel
anyway back to the story threads is
falling threads it's falling it's
falling bad thing
um
yeah so
what do you guys think
do you guys have a threads account
because I saw some kids with the dredge
application
but
who knows all right anyway
um our next topic
oh guys in the chat in the chat you need
to vote on what we're going to react to
today MKBHD or Miss Tuesday boss iOS 17
video and while you guys are doing that
let's talk about nothing so let's go to
the nothing phone website the official
website
because I I really don't understand it
the message phone is a mid-range phone
with the flagship chip that has a and
you are most welcome remember we offer
free consultations
um
the nothing phone
is an interesting project
it
the phone with lights on the back of it
that that is literally it now it has a
flagship ship which I do like at that
price price point but there's more there
are better options you got the pixel 7
it which not actually a flagship ship it
does the things the best it has great
video performance I've heard not video
like recording video but like
editing video
so the tension chip which is the same
chip in the across all the pixels is a
good video editing chip it does great
graphics and stuff so
what's that
it's a smarter phone it has a better
camera
um
and mostly uncomfortable check and then
of course you got the OnePlus One so
what nothing phone is banking on is
people buying the phone for the lights
which has apps supported
of one application which is ubu
but
how it how is nothing okay nothing's
phone
clip this right now click you can clip
this nothing's phone idea is uh upgraded
model of the no phone
throughout the presentation you're like
well you know we don't want people on
their phones as much that's why we have
these glyph lights
police
huh
please
the xiaomi me 11 1 11 I think I had a
screen on the back of the phone oh you
know these lights so useful we don't
want people on our phone as much that's
why we have a black and white mode of
our software
well that's nice do you know who also
has that Samsung it's called sleep mode
hey
the cameras in the lights woo the now I
do like that it's smooth and nice and
everything that's great that's great
but
what are you guys thinking together
and speaking of what you guys think
we're going to go into Mr burst
we got to interview
the CEO of Matthew but normally we're
not watching it we're not that kind of
time
um we're gonna watch him point out the
features of the nothing problem so he
switched from his iPhone 1200 to his
nothing six hundred dollars
so let's check that out
here's a Crazy Life Hack everyone needs
let's say you're writing an important
email to your boss but you don't know
where to start here's
all right and I've got the iOS 17
features video right there but you need
to react to that oh dang oh one seven b
e says sounds lame
wow well let's see what this video says
about that all right let's get to it for
the last three weeks I've taken my SIM
card out to the 1200 iPhone 14. okay
that that's um
oh wait
oh yeah he's European so he gets
blessed benefits of having a SIM card
Pro Max and put it into the brand new
nothing feeling too and the experience
was not at all what I was expecting oh I
forgot I forgot it does have this new
ringtone maker which is nice I've always
like wanted to make ringtones because
I've heard that in the past cell phones
used to come with ringtone
so for starters when you're making a
move to a phone that is literally half
the battery drain
I do like it has a one hook screen like
it has the flags it features but it most
phones sound cameras
it's not on that pixels f7a has 9 Hertz
and it's bright even in direct sunlight
one of the ways to usually discern
cheaper phones is that the screen
becomes quite washed out but not here
the brightness is not quite at the
iPhone's level but very close so 1 600
net is actually more it's brighter than
mine
1700 lips and if anything the fact that
the camera cutout is smaller makes this
phone screen actually feel more
liberated
iPhone which one's the next thing and I
was like yes because I see the punch on
and the pencil is like a big Notch oh
the resolution of the iPhone screen is
higher as is the resolution of just
about every top end Android phone but I
even asked someone with good vision and
an eye for spotting differences I can
barely tell the difference everybody
yeah that's true in normal things but I
can usually tell well I can tell I can
see pixels certain things
that's what I'm saying so
maybe if I get my hand drawn an s23
ultra or something I'll be able to tell
you brown puts in super high res screens
because they feel like they have to but
you can tell they know that the vast
majority won't notice the difference
because they disable the high res mode
by default I mean even on my Sony phone
which goes all the way up to 4K I've set
this phone to 1080p which I mean it
sounds like a crime against humanity I'm
only using a third of the pixels
available to me but I just don't need
any more and so what this all means is
that the nothing phone 2 hasn't one bit
felt like I'm making an aesthetic
compromise right so the Aesthetics go
ringtone maker
and that brings me on to the software so
this thing is running nothing os2 which
is a skin based on Android 13. right
um Android 14's coming up soon a lot of
ways this is how I would make the
software if I was going to do it myself
it's clean for starters I mean
everything from the core system
animations the boot up screen the Wake
from standby the status bar pull down
the way it Scrolls web pages the way the
home screen responds to the fingerprint
scanner the way it looks the way it
reacts and it's reliable too in my
experience plus this is a fast phone and
everything feels tuned towards speech
but in a way that's still graceful if
smartphones were chocolate bars then
using this doesn't feel like a KitKat or
a Twix this feels like a really
indulgent handmade chocolate fudge
brownie it's not flashy it's not
colorful but it's rich and speaking of
the lack of color this is a phone
recently the amount of choice you get is
insane you can pick your fingerprint
scanning icon yeah so the there's a
there's
not that much customization which is
kind of weird like you you have all this
character on the back of the phone you
got the lights but it didn't really go
to the customization route which okay
and one person put it it's more form
over function
yeah form of a function
so this phone it's kind of like a
fashion phone but most fashion films are
I'd say the new fashion phone is the
phone
what do you think
001b what do you think
and after waiting for Andrews to come in
what do you think do you think the
folding phone is the next fashion from
yeah I will start playing the video you
have a billion camera modes and filters
and every type of Animation that exists
on the device you can control I mean
apart from the glyph system which is an
obvious Advantage this thing has you can
choose your icon pack you can choose
your wallpaper and
That's all folks but I do want to stress
that the broad Strokes of what is going
on with nothing os are Peak Android I
was quite surprised to find that even
the battery and the audio are not
compromised either the phone 2 has a
4007 good bye 001be and you miss your
Philippine
have some fun
brownies
foreign
which is solid but it performs better
than solid maybe I mean 47
000 milliamps that's pretty good
they have 4 500 not 40. because
nothing's using an older chip on this
phone so they've had more time to
optimize it
just went hot
so maybe because nothing's only been
working on one phone this whole time
meanwhile most of their competitors have
had to split their time and resources
across 50.
maybe because the phone automatically
dark modes every single app whatever the
reason I'm keeping my Wi-Fi on my data
on my Bluetooth on my speakers at like
80 volume I'm living the life and for me
as a heavy user I'm just about getting
to these seven hours of screen on time
oh that's great
but there's just some capabilities this
phone
has when he's about to get to this like
so the newer trips 5G better connection
threaded Bluetooth but there's no
desktop support I don't think
there's no
it's just not that
it's not there
we're just missing the cameras basically
basically but it has to make trade off
somehow and that's how we made our
trade-offs for if we wanted to make a
600 phone it's just the software could
just be a bit
future rich and speaking of future Rich
Let's go to the one plus
um Nord it's a new phone
it's actually the first post we talked
about
um the technical historians will know
that
not this phone but the OnePlus note
series and OnePlus will know it into it
to 99 eight gigs around 128 gigabytes of
storage
typical budget phone like okay
but let's read these specs I wonder how
much micro trading would be
it's 5 24th dang it's like next week
okay let's see
I want to see the specs oh there we go
we got
well I guess I can save five percent off
because I'm a student
so we got a
well I don't know if this is six
centimeters but anyway I know that like
a centimeter is half of no sorry my foot
is 30 centimeters so that's basically
half a foot like this so it's about half
a foot big
over six inches and then
like
half of that so it's about six by three
inches okay and then it's
0.83 centimeters and then 195 degree but
whatever okay it is they're gonna come
find me inches six like it makes more
sense for this to be in
half meters
whatever uh 6.72 inches like that is a
big phone
the consensus is 6.6 inches this is 0.1
of an inch bigger than my phone and
potentially wider it has a 391 pixel per
inspiration whatever it's a bunch of
them great
an LCD display whatever a 120 which
First Rate which is better than the
pixel 7A uh yes it's a good phone but
it's not removable battery and it has 5G
um but yes it's really good phone for
price LCD display whatever okay people
aren't really going to notice it's 2.99
120 years described great
um but let's really get to the actual
features
oh
you should have missed this phone
because I saw on Phone Arena that they
were releasing something else a Qualcomm
snap track at 6.95
that's
selling
um let me check phone away this may be
the wrong phone
Arena
anyway that's still a decent let's do a
decent specs right there 6.95 5G but I
mean it does make my argument for this
over nothing from kind of non-existent
it's nothing but we got uh 100 gigabytes
of storage and uh 200 uh how much
eight gigabytes of RAM
wait
let me check sorry about this but still
it's a decent budget phone don't get me
wrong this is good enough for most
people 120 hoods got the good camera got
a good decent is Chip uh let's see if I
got any comments uh he says
right it's a Phone Arena
research just for you now that romance
11. I'd get that over the or even the
10t over the uh
those are the
uh nothing on any day every day
like if someone said hey look you're
gonna get the one plus
um you can either get the one plus phone
or you can get the nothing phone I think
um let me think one plus all the way
sorry about that guy sorry about that
guys
OnePlus Note 3 5G I was looking at the
wrong phone
not the n30 that's last year's
now this this phone it it's a beast
this phone has
great design
not the original one in three
in three come on
this phone
it was announced July
20 it was announced
all right guys
sorry about that last one I was getting
the two friends confused this phone
right here
6.74 inches about the same dimensions
you've got the same camera module 50
megapixels and eventually 990 which I
looked it up on phone I mean it looks
like it's
on par with the s22 plus which is
another powerful most people just kind
of like a bit
eight
eight gigabytes of women of 5 000
milliamp battery with oxygen OS 13 and
it's going to get updates
according to this you can buy it
50 megapixel camera that's good in a
megapixel Ultra whatever and two
megapixel macro it might as well stuck a
stick on it it's a piece of junk okay
and you actually actually get decent
video recording unlike on Snapchat and
four question one you get 4k 30 and 60
and 1080p 120 FPS and I'm pretty sure I
could do some uh
recording
like so slow mo going to end when this
thing releases
whatever the price is probably going to
be rightful to nothing wrong great
design I think it has wireless charging
I think like this phone it
beat your feet like more random minus 22
plus got a bigger screen than a minus 22
plus a bigger battery comfortable chip
and it has more storage than the model
there's 22 plus I have right now and but
it
is on cameras
fingerprint scanner
that's basically oh and of course I got
decks so that's it what matters what are
these people
specs like pure spec monster
and price like spec surprise that beats
any mid-range Samsung has but Samsung
has their little Flagship power has the
the power and a half decks
power to zoom in
and of course I guess more support
yeah
I and since none of you chimed in
unfortunately about the iOS 17 video
we're going to do Mr who's the Boss
all right the Top 10 IOS 17 features and
we're going to go eat or representative
and if Android should get to use I know
if it's how to invest in stocks in 30
seconds just this is okay so
before we get into this I like that he
separated it by a time stamp so
um we're gonna skip through that
probably not going to watch the whole
thing right we have original content
here at the tech boy media
um I'll be AFK but be listening
um
does afk mean away from them
I'm gonna assume it does
um and let me show this
again
YouTube link
it's my YouTube there it is
all right
um iOS is IOS 17. I've been using it for
about a month it's oh it's in beta
that's what I assume all right text
correction
or in other words your phone will better
understand what you're trying to say and
this works in two ways autocorrect is
noticeably more accurate like you can
actually so better audio correct that
that's always a good feature that's
always useful
um not just how it Stacks up against
Android so that's good what what okay so
FaceTime
great so when you now react to things
you get these augmented reality effects
that I guess just there to amplify that
expression it's not I mean that's
interesting
but
it's not the most different from
touching a button but you know it's more
seamless but you're gonna you really
gotta show it to the camera so
useful and I can contact posters and
this is actually useful
if you have an iPhone uh
but
it creates contact posters for people
which means
you don't have to make them for everyone
you just have to make one for you and
it's basically kind of like
a social network profile on a social
network you don't have to categorize
everyone but you they make their own
profile pictures and everyone can see it
this is basically your profile picture
for it for iPhones
I I read the iMessage was kind of like a
social network and I kind of agree with
that now like think about it iMessage is
a social network
um
iPhone's becoming more like a key into a
social network that
that if you don't have you you can't get
access to like this sun boot which kind
of let you get access but
now I got new profile pictures you got
your messaging slash game application in
iMessage you got your
uh
yeah
let me see it's not got access to a
video
yeah see
but I was
I had someone quite a video of me
yesterday and it came through blue it
wouldn't really listen hoping but still
can't feel really because iOS Android
the extended by link so I'm requesting
access
um
away from keyboard on wireless
headphones that's why I've seen that
video from YouTube oh okay
yeah so contact posters
your profile picture your network is
iMessage
so yeah
iPhones are becoming a key
to a secret well not secret I just feel
good to a special social network this is
probably the headline feature of iOS 17.
Apple spent quite a bit of three upgrade
too and I'm particularly so now she can
say answer from yes I'm gonna activate
it when you say Hey Siri you don't have
to say it anymore
glad that Siri is getting some love
because it feels like it was introduced
12 years ago as the future of how to
interact with your phone and then it
just sat while Google Assistant has been
getting better at a much faster rate
get about Bixby guys don't forget about
fixing it became more conversational
right
you must forgot about this so for
starters you can make profiles that's
useful it's not on Chrome yet but hey
whatever uh you can create different
profiles by creating different
Google accounts and then of course they
let you like Incognito but Samsung
internet will already allow you to do so
one for one basically Apple um let's see
uh text collection we can't really say
if Android or iOS is better FaceTime
yeah whatever
um not sure if it works on the link goes
in the faceland because if it does then
it's kind of like a half point for apple
contact post is easy win forever right
there Android
I mean
I mean if you put in someone's email
address from Gmail then you'll get the
pixel but no that's an easy one for
Apple right there
um it's the front door turn this social
network Siri
that's kind of like catching up to
Google assistant so that's not a win so
tax correction we're going to just make
it one one FaceTime
two one three one three two Safari we'll
say
three and a half and two right standby
marks on charge in some way it can be
Apple's 100 plus wireless charger
Samsung technically has something like
that and you could create a mode before
when this happens but this is more
advanced we're going to get the point to
Apple so let's just four and a half to
two things done which is very fancy but
I'm glad that it doesn't have to be that
and that you just make sure it's in
horizontal mode it'll activate this new
interface this is a widget screen which
lets you pick from a bunch of different
interactive titles a photos page and
then speaking of widgets their widgets
became Interactive
but that's not really a win because I
can already adjust clock page where you
can cycle through this do not end with
standby though so this is an iOS 17 home
screen you can call someone directly
from it
call someone
Egypt oh my goodness
so
this isn't even a win I messaged let's
see what happens with messages so for
starters new interface very shiny but
sure we're not going to give them a win
for that so let's keep listening then
you know the speech detection just got
better so now when you send a voice note
it literally instantly transcribes it
and I know pixels can do that
um I don't think Samsung messages can do
that in fact we're gonna test that out
right now right now
um not on Samsung messages but on Google
messages so uh let me full screen myself
so I'm going to go to the Google
messages application I still use Samsung
messages
I can't even type
t g
I'm just typing messages so I don't know
I'm going to send this to people on SMS
wait Microsoft start can be a SMS
that's weird I'm going to send a message
to myself
okay let's see if I can transcribe but
I'm sorry
okay
first
oh Titan holds record audio okay
Samsung is the best phone company in
South Korea
okay
I'm gonna send it to myself
oh I have to have mobile data
I'm on Wi-Fi
right I have it on the center again
Samsung is the best phone company in
South Korea
all right it was sent
I can see it but
it's not
transcribe
but
we do have live caption
but that's not the same so that's a win
for a message right there
all right and it's smart about it like
if you send a 15 minute recap of your
life it knows that that's something that
the other person needs to listen to to
get but if I don't understand
it just doesn't make sense if you think
about it
if you want to send an audio note that's
short
there's voice typing for that
if you want to send the long audio note
it's a cell phone just call them
I mean oh man you want to hear five
seconds of their voice well then reading
it kind of takes the rate of purpose
back so it's
it's kind of a non-existent but useful
feature but it kind of takes away the
purpose of it you can call them oh you
can say well I don't want people to hear
me you want to talk me to your phone
it's my little voice type right yes no
if you just wanted to send a voice note
that says hey remember to buy milk
because
yeah like if it's a voiceless hey
remember to buy milk why would they take
out their phone see that they have a
voice post play
okay look it's the transcribed for you
might as well just saved your phones and
processing power at their phone I'm
mostly processing
it type into just voice type
that's what I'm saying is say you're in
a situation where you can't type then it
will turn that message into text
yeah voice typing it exists it's been
around today like but 10 years so okay
stickers let's move on I have not what's
this five and a half or two
once in my life made a custom sticker on
a phone until iOS 17. because this makes
it very easy and very very cool so let's
say you're browsing your photos and you
come across this masterpiece you just
hold down on the face and click create
sticker all right I think I can do that
so I'm going to take a front facing cam
I'm gonna take a picture with the front
facing camera
uh oh wait that's the back face okay
oh that actually looks good
I'm gonna hold down
I'm gonna hold my face down come on
I got it and I'm gonna click sure
let's see
I can share it as a text
let's see let's see if it's same as
ministers
oh it doesn't turn me into a sticker
that's kind of sad
uh
this AR Zone through that let's see
Samsung stickers
oh you got the creating your gather it I
don't even know so I'm gonna go to
Gallery I already extracted myself
um but then
edit
maybe not something
you go to stickers
yeah I made stickers before
you can select the picture to use a
sticker select done
but you have to put on time for another
video
so that's weird wait
okay my goodness so yes it is harder let
me see I'm gonna reset this to my
default messaging application
I want to see what Microsoft start this
as the messages app
that's weird
um let me see uh
it's contact stickers
oh is that emoticons
it says use stickers you have to use
Samsung keyboard oh okay now we switch
to Samsung keyboard there we go
I press play Let's see
I didn't know you could do this let me
see where's the gallery stickers button
I know you can do this come on this is a
Samsung phone
that's a gif
um we're gonna keep trying this
um
um gif
let's see that's AI emerging
um let's see
I'm probably doing this one I don't send
stuff like that anymore you see great
stickers to decorate photos
let's see go on it's your Galaxy phone
go into the image
because like the pencil icon I could I
have to stick a create sticker
you can only use these stickers
um
you can only use stickers in the gallery
application you can't export them that's
kind of sad so that is a feature for iOS
that's it that's something that you can
now drop straight away into messages and
not just in this really flat way that
feels like a typical conversation thread
you can put them anywhere and then you
can turn those digital stickers into
what feels like physical stickers with
different interesting future just that
useful like oh wow look you got to stick
at least on my phone I got an edge panel
and can stretch going just like
an effect that respond to how you tilt
your photos yes right that's six and a
half to two come on Android oh that
that's it
okay do you think we should get points
for what we already have
you know six and a half today that's
that's kind of sad
all right
watch this okay so we talk about
stickers we talked about the nothing
foam we were supposed to talk about
voice cloning but I never got a Discord
message let me check if I got it now
see if he sent it to me
no direct messages about voice clothing
so that's unfortunate let's keep talking
um
let's see
what's the next oh we gotta get back to
our articles yeah yes our articles
I'm gonna share this
oh yes there we go we can talk about
accessing special characters but we'll
get back to that after they got our

great
um obviously note 9 right there up the
top
and when the note 20 came out not that
one no 20 Ultra came out oh I wanted it
so much all right um back to this just
wanted to show this they've been
I'm writing some interesting articles
this is a good one I've read this before
but let's go through this like tint
again let's see if I forgot it it
existed oh and speaking of tech gadgets
cricket
is giving out three gigabytes of free
data if you download the application not
sponsor them I get this so I can test
out their Network
um and then they'll send you SIM card
Android because iOS
a quick and easy
iPhone 14. all right let's see um let's
go to the Tiger Electronics here until
games these were games that were
handheld made by Tiger Electronics
but they only played one game and didn't
have cartridges and you can still make
them I think he has spoke I did this so
trackball mics okay overhead projectors
we used to have one didn't if you used
to have uh overhead projectors
I think the last one came out in 2008
phone shoulder rest it's it's like I'm
pretty sure they still make them because
that phone looks pretty modern to me it
looks like they got that from an Amazon
listing yeah see since you can still buy
one the collabers like the front smart
home plug that we reviewed but just for
clap and it turns off the lights instead
of using an app talk boy and Alexa for
something oh it's that thing in that
movie and it talks voice changes okay CD
bonus
um
one thing about those is that it was
actually illegal to take
a CD and put the music from the CD onto
your mp3 player unless you're at
explicit right for from copyright code
um from the copyright holder
which you probably did unless you made
the music yourself
that's it
okay just
content we can react to I'll leave you
on this homepage go to YouTube we're
going to stream for about an hour longer
so if anyone wants to come in here
um probably until seven
let's see does someone watching my
podcast episode that's great
thank you let me see what I have on
YouTube here
oh which two is the boss
traded all this Tech in for wrist
product that's kind of sad
it's kind of unfortunate for the pixel
folds out what do you guys think about
the pixel fold
I think it's decent
um let's see oh VBS and then and I kind
of forgot the song because obviously the
best song of all time the boat is
the
boat is obviously
in the wild
[Music]
all right
let's let's keep scrolling tools
remember you might have
a end of extremiversity
and you know we can we can react to
wish.com right you want me to start
doing wish.com stuff
you know we got buy me a coffee if
anyone wants to buy me a coffee we have
a link I can put it down in the comments
um let me see this and Alpha if you want
to sponsor me look oh uh oh I'll do some
podcast episodes of operate it
okay
I'll I'll go ask them for a sponsorship
I mean it doesn't really cost them money
think about it
it's a browser just send me a browser
you give me a hundred dollars like I'll
take a hundred dollars it's a gift card
what's okay
[Music]
it's a browser not a cell phone
awfully listening to that um modular
design is a really amazing thing
kind of looks like sidekick to me but
anyway uh I will use this browser and a
few podcast episodes and we'll be happy
about using this browser and if you
bought against episodes for a good price
of course but
okay a hundred dollars off if you listen
again
um that is one of the most Innovative
things I've seen
since
that
five minutes ago
every time I buy a piece of tech that I
know I'm going to keep I try and make
sure I buy the very best
seven thousand dollars for a MacBook
what does he do with that MacBook I
guess a team of editors
and according to him oh this is Mr
anyway a producer has entered this
year's desktop computers
the only time I see that Mac is um what
he's using that which could be replaced
by a Chromebook but okay it's boxed what
if you only had a total budget of three
thousand dollars couldn't even buy this
laptop
S three thousand dollars to replace not
just my phone my laptop my speaker but
everything I own three thousand dollars
to replace not just my phone did you see
that phone
looks like a pixel 3 XL
all right
down here looks like a pixel 3 right and
then on the screen it looks like uh
iPhone but then you see this Android 5
ask Google Search widget right there
which I'm surprised you can even run the
iOS and style launcher we have this
anxious ancient looking Play Store thing
that looks like it from 2015. oh let me
up the quality you know this is a tech
Channel after all
in my laptop my speaker but everything I
own well there's only one site where I
think it's going to be possible
hello wish.com I might as well start
with my phone there's the goods let's
look at these specs right here
I 14 pro Max and I don't think specs are
good for 113 I tell everyone to forget
that crunchial uh one plus three
interest and get this let me look at
these books eight plus 250 gigabytes
eight gigs of RAM 256 gigs 108 megapixel
camera and a seven thousand eight
hundred million package basically tablet
size battery and an iPhone uh six point
seven inch iPhone and a dimensionally 9x
Flex APK too and then 5G plus plus
which sounds like something at T would
come up with tough five t plus plus
and another thing I'm wondering is what
is he edit this if anyone knows this
please tell me because
that that's a what browser is that
that's not a real browser it's an
editing and it's amazing always rely on
wish.com to break the frontiers of
Technology I've got to replace my
speaker oh good lord
what 12 000 rounds of power wow
first 12 000 watt power oh it's actually
going to be so difficult I've got to
replace my MacBook too you've got to be
kidding me
look at this
I mean my that my screen on here is
probably like
definitely
40 of the laptop it looks like it's 30
of the left
that looks like it's a tablet running
inside one of those huge cases they give
to kids so they don't like Drop it or
anything
yeah some screen without pencil oh wait
this looks good 81 billions all right
let's read this very carefully 2023 new
k
u150
cool
whatever uh CPU three one gigahertz
metal shell laptop uh for memory cards
okay
it comes with a memory card 128 one
piece
um
it's quite a little it's a scam you'll
see how we're not really a scam it's
just deceptive eight pizza from 504 gigs
SSD something's off here it comes with a
one terabyte memory now you can always
fake that because it's a good like some
fake little thing and changing the
software or something but fast it's
firmware to show that it's a terabyte
but it's actually a gigabyte you can't
as well we'll see what happens an Apple
Watch I actually remember seeing a video
about how to make these like fake things
on that band August speak
and looks pretty good to me like I saw
some why does this look so real I also
have to swap out all of my gaming stuff
I think wish.com has made their own
version of the Nintendo
this is basically a box that has games
on you can add your own games to it it's
fairly easy to do especially like a TV
box the Wii they call it the Y2 fit and
then the actual console is just this
tiny little stick that plugs away that
we didn't have all those buttons did
they
wait they had a plus button
I'm not sure
a game
I have like a million questions
that's kind of cool though I wish it
even has a mini PS1 yes
except it's way cheaper and also
apparently has 600 games so it's
designed like a Sony that's
possible in console it looks like a
great like
so
uh yeah nice it's got the colors of a
Nintendo console and it's playing a game
from a PC but yeah that that and those
Graphics look a bit
too good consider me curious the site
has like an unlimited number of
earphones
yeah earphones are probably just like
rebranding
very fast different firmware on it so
the pairing sounds something probably
get them from somewhere in the factory
two dollars for Creative film
I mean is it just me or does that
massive why is it clear bulb did I think
they're nothing or something
not look like it's going to fit
comfortably in your ears six dollars for
an electric toothbrush with four
okay
that's all right
vibrating Moodle
in the bristles just go along with it
you push the button
if I had the technology interchangeable
brush heads
interchangeable but wow
there are dollars to a Lego sets
okay
speaking of
you know how you know this because the
best site
on
the internet
apart from my side of course
not being told me you know not the B two
dollar store Lego
why is it not telling me well we'll keep
looking back really really high-end
toothbrush that I normally use so that
will be a fun comparison uh I just
realized we also have to swap our camera
so this is actually really scary because
I know for sure that what I'm looking at
right now is not an 8K camera I actually
have to be so careful to make sure that
I don't get stuck with like a 240p web
camera
like his brainy thing looks better than
right at 240p will looks like
let's keep looking okay
um oh let's keep on giving us I think
this is our best bet 474 says it's 4K
videos I'm gonna replace my favorite I
think we have a camera like that but
cheaper not before 1974 for trash
I don't understand why well if you have
to give it
okay this seems very reasonably priced
surely a bin is like the one piece of
tech where you actually don't want a
bright light shining onto your stuff
yeah I guess I guess
maybe it's UV like
covet God how do you make an automatic
rechargeable self-cleaning robot for
twenty three dollars right now it's time
to replace my gym gear rip my future
workouts
okay a treadmill with no handles does
that make it just a tread so this is
just a knockoff of powerballs the
difference in price is shocking what are
you doing it's like a workout tool
that's meant to correct your posture oh
cool that's nice but a bath mat that
tells you it's a bath mat
well if we had labels that label
everything on the floor like floor
apparently it's super absorbent and
quick drying it sits on the label of no
smelly how could I forget massage guns
and it's definitely the kind of product
where there's got to be a massive markup
like the really high-end Farragut that I
got from a video a while ago that was
like six hundred dollars you know this
600 wow
I don't have any massages that would
save you
let's see
uh
let's keep it open I mean looks like the
exact same thing let's compare it no so
the water bottle I use every single day
is an error bottle which has these
different scented pods that you can swap
in and swap out to make you think that
you're drinking flavored water so you
can get a wish.com version of the era
bottle and the scent oh my Amber mug
which I use literally every single day
no it's got to go to it comes in a gift
box I mean from my experience most
products from the site come in a bag so
that feels like a must-have technically
I mean I've got a sort out my desk too
okay this looks pretty bad but if we are
good guys basically authentic wish.com
experience I think this is the way to go
I also have to get a full-size PC
replacement switch.com not sell PCS okay
this is a PC case on a Mac case I think
we're gonna have to build our own pieces
using only wish.com this is just
basically an over that's a YouTube troll
practice for it like everyone to build
their own PC with oh it's Xbox series X
cool idea let's try and make a wish.com
version of the Xbox series X and compare
it in performance to the real ones we've
got to get a graphics card motherboard
CPU yes for wish.com to Steve for
storage oh this does not seem right
there's no way this is a 512 gig M2 SSD
for 31.78 new skill ramp that's water
cool the whole thing why not what do we
do about our chair children's swing
hammock toy set
hanging chair this is where I decide how
much I wanted to commit myself to this
wish.com thing I know it says it can
support 200 kg do I trust it and I guess
just now I control it to wrap the whole
thing off the only thing left if I am
actually to replace everything I own
you're gonna have to be clothing too hey
well the bright side this looks a lot
better than their Tech yeah I just I
don't think this is going to fit me
Japanese fashion men long pants those
look a bit low what was a wish.com suit
gonna look like actually really highly
rate is the thing since I traded on my
tap I didn't went to my life where I
probably would have thought this was a
good fashion choice
and I'm probably not enough of a fan of
Cheetos to pull this off but I love how
in your face the printing is here it
just covers the entire hoodie Shrek I
mean this hat is kind of how I feel
right now that's very interesting shoes
wings
actually that's right we've either
distract ourselves a massive bargain or
I've ruined my life for a week
looking back it's crazy how long it took
me to leave my contacts and glasses
behind
oh it is I just accepted the daily
hassles I'm sure you did that's
unfortunate it's good stuff
let's get unboxing let's do the things
that are least essential to my life
moving on to the things that are most
essential let's start with the cleaning
gadgets I actually made a sweeping robot
for like ten dollars this kind of thing
I guess it's a good thing I mean the
price
looks like it's a joke find out
everything is amazing to clean your fur
if any of you guys own or know a cat is
it normal for there to be a layer of fur
over your floor every single morning so
I don't know I'm about to have a
celebration for my engagement and look
at the floor paper we've got Plastics
we've got a rubber band we will be using
not this this oh wow the lightness of
this fish
[Music]
I think I can give you more than a five
though five
that is an electric motor that does
nothing and it wonders aimlessly around
your house
in all my moves here I'll give it a tube
instead of throwing it into that bed
wait and I have to say
I really like this I find that the
emotions it's a trash kit how can you
mess up a trash can it's a hole you just
put stuff in it detection is a little
unreliable so I tend to just use the
open close button and to be honest it
actually opens with so much Vigor it
tends to smack your fingers on the way
it's also a weapon hey maybe you can put
like stuff on and get it people go
they are so almost approach it like a
wild animal so in that sense it is less
good than the simple human being that I
used to
yeah but
job it's not it's a trash can Wait
it's a bucket
it's not that hard to mess up or make I
mean it's kind of hard to mess up a
trash can if you ask me I mean
if he messes up it just becomes the
product
to be a good trash can it has also Dawn
he probably should have gone a couple of
sizes up because there's a massive
benefit yeah
I think and we've got the watch I don't
use smart watches on a day-to-day basis
so for me this is highly non-essential
you didn't buy a real Apple watch I'm
sure this was less than like 100 no part
of this packaging looks anything but the
producer of packaging costs more than a
watch because there's no thing I mean it
feels on the light side for what I would
expect the real Apple watch Ultra
two-way I haven't actually tested it
myself oh cool you get two boxes inside
so you get one that says Ultra
which is the watch itself and then one
that says 49 millimeters
does that works they are for 49
millimeter band
I guess you can keep watching you know
like normally between real and fake
products I can tell straight away the
bands are a bit of a giveaway you can
kind of see the seams of the molds they
were printed from which Apple is very
good at avoiding but still I mean it's
not like you can tell how from a
distance here's the giveaway look at
this the resolution of this picture
right here Applewood
looks bad but okay
no way it's sealed in the exact same way
the Apple seals its products to kind of
feel the same
no the thing is now elf is actually
quite weighty and dense and premium
designed by watching
who's the company where'd you get to
watch from what yes you watch I got it
from what where what what what in China
it's getting into bed at the end of day
one with this watch and so far I'm kind
of Blown Away for the price it was the
hardware feels so realistic the software
so tonight actually I'm going to track
my sleep both with the in mattress
tracker that yeah his investors he needs
to get a mattress from wish.com
they're normally used which is very
accurate and that's and then just see
how well this lines up to that so
shockingly it's actually not the amount
of oh we got our friend back again
that's right come on say it with me in
the comments you need to get his message
from wish.com he cheated he's lying to
his followers
shame
deep sleep basically spot on but it does
seem to be a little bit confused about
what counts as deep sleep versus light
sleep it's just run out of battery so
you clip it onto here with this loose
magnetic connection but to be fair this
has been running for three full days
non-stop I've actually uh at my
engagement this is a really sad time
to be using a phone that was then the
Nokia 103.
I mean this is a really bad time to be
using a phone that is
so lagging
it has no concept of UI
it's going to think this is not going to
be out
you know what let's talk about AI for a
second it helps a lot with communication
but it's still really important to make
sure that everything are set up can't
beat this
all right well maybe it's not actually
like a billion watts in power oh could
you imagine if it was severe weapons
throttle on the lines of Wars push the
button on your phone
oh here it actually says technical
specifications power output 5 Watts
times
that's 10 watts two let's start with the
ear sensor
um these actually don't looking five's
out of airpods we think about how
advanced we are you can get something
electric battery powered bluetooth
enabled for five dollars exactly like
knock-off airpods like I was expecting
them to the top of the case almost as a
lip that goes down feels a little bit
rattly in a way that expensive earphones
don't and also if you open it with a
tiny bit too much force wait what do you
expecting
five dollars
you can neither get this
or like
two tacos or a bag of candy
um the infants themselves are kind of
like apples from the front but with flat
sides which actually makes them more
comfortable to hold
okay the speaker as much as I am
disappointed that it's much much smaller
than it was advertised to be it's at
least like a weighty package
oh it really is a rug rule well I'm
heading down for a session on the
treadmill with these bad boys genuinely
feels like it's completely empty man
there's so many things that high-end
earphones do well that you just take for
granted it's so difficult if it doesn't
perspective
earbuds are like two hundred dollars
making this see it's 20. 40 times more
expensive cheaper so the shape of these
to actually get them out with one hand
and they're really really like stiff
they don't slide out I just realized
they do actually have touch controls so
you can touch the stem to try and pause
your music which is cool for even to
this phrase but it's not in a way that's
kind of painful and it feels like when
you hover your ear with your earlobe and
then tap it okay and also only one of
them works this is not okay
a good product so my sister's prepared a
playlist for our official engagement
party might as well use that to take
this first off
I really wish they just stuck in those
voices that tell you what mode it's on
as opposed to having to listen to these
random beeps and guests
oh there we go um
this is rough two hours later
ah we're in
[Music]
I don't know what these days
right and he was surprised at me I mean
it's actually very well timed because I
was kind of looking for a bit of a
wardrobe changeup I like going for
clothes that are really subtle in terms
of branding like not like massive logos
plastered across them I don't think this
is gonna quite fit the bit oh yeah you
can't complaining about the vibrancy of
the prince look at this if they printed
the exact same thing on both sides
fabric is very extremely very thin I'm
gonna go check on something I want to
save my phone arrive because if it's
right I'm gonna unbox it live show you
guys
foreign
guys it's here we can unbox it live
um for you guys
um let me check make sure it's the right
thing
um
all right we got this
wedding I'm gonna
that hoodie looks horrible hi sang
um yeah yeah he got it from wish.com I'm
glad to see you here I'm actually about
to unbox a phone live so you can have a
great time TCL x40 Pro oh it's oh it's
everything
sing says yo hello sing I missed you and
TCL
40
XL
let me put this down
Post Live unboxing you've ever had on
this channel the rest of the boxes other
stuff that's not mine it all came here
from a time they deal
oh let me let me put this camera down
what do you want on the keyboard
I was gonna do like a premier of this
but this this is too important this is
too important
okay we will get back to this video soon
we gotta do this all right I'll just go
over the specs
from the thing this is the from TCL
can you see this guys
oh my goodness
I'm like Mr who's the Boss
just
less technology
I just read the specs off on the screen
we got 50 megapixel camera same as on
that OnePlus phone but you know it's not
just megapixels synthesized that matters
uh 6.75 inch display making it larger
than my
s22 Plus
I have no idea what that icon means six
gigabytes of RAM and 25 gigs of RAM
it's an equal processor wow so advanced
not like every phone has said that first
impressions
I like the flat edges
I like the flat edges
they got that stupid sticker
interesting design what do you think
saying
uh has a SIM card and SD card slot
it's larger than my s22 Plus
so that's good
it's very light oh it has a headphone
jack that's nice
USBC see if it will turn on the screen
is nice it's hot but that's because it
was outside in a box
it's turning on we'll set that to the
side and while it's turning on
we've got
some quick start manuals
she says it looks cool yeah it does
some quick start manuals a
SIM card ejector maybe I can test it out
on the qriket thing and of course we'll
sell it
um for 200 on eBay
2 10 2 30. that's a good deal this phone
goes for about two 260 on eBay and we
got a charger in the box which will also
good and we're going to keep this box
nice and tidy for our users on
the thick
so we got a charger USB sync I don't
know how many watts I'm gonna set this
up while reacting to the thing
let's do the video so we'll look at
these hoodies
and let's see if it looks horrible and
I'll set this up
it's not that heavy
and let's get to it
I can easily see through both layers to
the other side can't argue with that
friend what's gonna happen when you put
that in the washer okay so I'm not
connecting to uh Network right now I'll
just connecting Wi-Fi it's about forty
dollars I'm not blown away to be honest
like it's the most important thing is
fresh
fresh oh my goodness
does it look good A little tired you're
all right you know I'd probably I'd wear
this on video where people can't
see the fabric in person these are our
incredibly low things
cotton
or
where do you think that fabric is made
out of
that's not how trousers should look
that's where my feet go so they call
this techware I guess because it has
loads of pockets and a very versatile to
store things in but I'll tell you one
thing you can't do with this run
yeah I'm disgusting yeah that's trash
and and I'm scanning the QR code to my
Wi-Fi I'm not gonna see because then you
can figure out where I live and it's
connecting through one leg any further
than about this I will split it down
below I'll put a pin buddy hey stop all
right yo let's continue
and then she says cheap cotton or silk I
don't think silk is cheap but okay and
my phone is getting ready right now back
to the video obviously got 30 minutes
left on the screen
sports like material it feels decent
quality but you know what that's what I
expected when I ordered this so
those pants are fired
okay so I had to make
a joke um
well done
I think
Pablo
yeah yeah okay great great shut up why
there's a decent alert
interrupting my stream like that did you
guys hear that
hi super high elective how are you oh
and since all these new people are
coming in oh it's going well uh
um reacting to this video we got before
we spent some more time on the stream my
phone came in I'm gonna view this and
sell it on eBay no I don't want to
receive uh Wireless alerts on a brand
new phone that I'm gonna sell and
um of course
no pressure of course but we are
you know we gotta make money so we have
a buy me a coffee.com so that's the
techboard.org if any of you would like
to contribute
um anyway speaking of the Pablo penguin
hat yeah he wore this see
a little potato hat but back to the
video
oh wait you didn't see the Hat because I
wasn't saying
I'm trying to somehow I'm worth money I
can't even stream correctly
see he was uh Hey like that right
let us share this instead
let me share my face
there you go and I'll just put that in
the chat
put the link in the chat yep I'm gonna
do that
I'll take the link this link down and
put it in the chat
and while I'm doing that
you will be able to see and my phone's
just getting ready
to
do so
I'm yourcoffee.com
and you should see it in the chat
uh
where's my kit now
in the check
and click that while watching the video
what I feel like right now I feel like
my mom is telling me what to wear
[Music]
it's missing why is there a spinning
blade on the head
selfish
um
the wings are separate look at that
all right the shoes are modular how you
replace this part very close shoes with
eBay only from wish.com only the best
with these they come with instructions
wait
this is a clearly used pair of scissors
that's that's interesting right I wanted
to copy apps and data page I'm not going
to copy
um I'm probably gonna use this for like
just a few days maybe like today
tomorrow
Monday
I mean the battery life's been great
I've been coming about that so you know
it's nice Vegas can't be choosers
if you want better battery life I'm not
going to sign into my Google account
right now I have to sign them into my
work account unless this isn't some
random wish.com
I will say though not the most
comfortable they've not really indulged
in padding in any part of the shoe so
one of these various different parts of
the shoe are detachable which is cool
but it's just a bit strange that when
you attach them they don't it doesn't
feel like it's a 90 Hertz right now all
right let's see unlock the fingerprint
I'm going to put my typical password on
here please do not watch
okay uh I'm actually kind of full screen
so you can't see me oh I'm gonna turn on
the phone because probably see me see if
it accepts my password it looks like
they belong there you see everyone
really famous people go to those fashion
events and the interviewers are always
asking them who are you wearing as in
like what brand are you wearing well for
the first time in your life you are
seeing
wish.com
this is so bad I'm literally all I'm
trying to do is sit cross-legged while
using these pants but they don't
actually have enough room to be able to
do that
that's weird starting an online all
right guys I'm gonna turn the camera
back on now
time for fingerprint setup I'm gonna
it's been good oh
see on in-screen fingerprint scanners I
always use this hand
but I can't really do that on this side
because that's going to be
accomplishable so here we go
I don't use
if actually never used a capacitive
I've never used a fingerprint scanner I
was on a phone if I was used in screen
so high tech in advance this is
awful
thank uh see anti-privative have you
ever used a fingerprint scanner on but
I'm not using face recognition I got
sensitive data on here okay I already
used to trash finger scanner
um
I'm not gonna be registering my face if
you've seen the camera on this thing
this is not an iPhone
oh let's see what's next Vision image
and video and management game
enhancement I don't game and if I did
game I would not game on this
and I have to agree to your privacy
privacy so whatever and we are home
all right we got
settings
comes with uh Microsoft start
it comes with
well it doesn't come with it has ads on
here because of course if I can fix this
for the person who buys it
we got the Play Store
Google discover is this on 120 hertz I
mean not 100 hits I've only used the
Facebook Edition yeah but at least yours
are secured you have an iPhone but this
this is what what Android version is
this on let's see
guess what I enjoyed visiting this is on
before I tell you
they're about phone wow
this is on
Android 13. the newest version of
Android
probably won't ever get an update ever
as a Media Tech India 335 whatever that
means six gigs of RAM
uh displayed it's kind of bad but
whatever let's just have gesture support
let's see
it does have gestures but I'm a button
kind of kid let me let me see what
oh it just lagged right there let's I'm
going to move a widget down there you go
let me see with the Google icon looks
like
oh yeah at Angles you can see pixels
wait it's okay the haptics listen to
this
let me turn up the volume
oh
I almost dropped my investment right
here
if you can hear that vibrating
not good let's see
I don't know how you yeah I'd have to
turn that off but the Wi-Fi I mean feels
decent to me
I don't know if what what speed this is
on
like if this is on 90 Hertz let's see
oh my goodness
wait what is that noise oh it's my
that's weird
I've always used
mid-range and then Flagship I'm gonna
have to reverse the buttons because I'm
used to Samsung
I've never used budget let's see
it's that smart refresh rate so it's
refreshing based on
I'm going to just flip it to me
all right now I'm going to open up
Microsoft start which is a News
application and I'm going to scroll to
and this is also closer to stock Android
so
it's kind of lagging but maybe that's
this connection so I can't really tell
all right let's do uh
see if can I split screen
I can
wait
hey guys look at this I can split screen
something not even an iPhone can do wow
this screen feels kind of sticky
I don't know maybe it's because it's new
very good build quality
let me take a picture
why does my cabinet
oh yeah for Geotech
okay let's see what camera mode you got
here we got Auto
video
portrait a pro mode really we got manual
autofocus white balance it's trying to
focus on my face here that's interesting
how far can you send one pro fourth
four times Zoom is that normal love
how [ __ ] is it only four okay oh
that's in video
only four okay so four times zoom camera
on on here the camera apps UI is kind of
weird
okay
um
see and then we got I'm gonna take a
picture and hit you know kind of dimly
lit
we're gonna take a picture
all right let's see
okay so first thing no details in the
wall but in my poster you can kind of
see it's kind of splotching it looks
like it's using Google photos
to
show the picture
like I think that's his default gallery
application oh
you have a few studies let's see 12.5
megapixels
we have a oh saying says yes to go bye
I'll keep reacting to this video
and I'll keep talking about the phone as
we go
stories
easier than you think let me show you
how to quickly open one with shoppable
oh wow we got some interesting features
here we got macro movie video which adds
black bars I guess Hypixel I guess
that's the 50 megapixel mode okay let me
take a picture
and we also have
let me see if
still no details in the walls oh and
it's shutter speed is kind of bad so I
probably wouldn't use that mode all
right let's see what other modes do we
have here
we have light tracing which can capture
and draw a light that's interesting
that's actually useful because it's hard
to do that in the Pro settings of say a
Samsung phone super macro whatever and
then there's a promo and Panorama oh
it's stop motion
stop motion just looks like it's
you can pause and place like video can
normally
oh they mean time lapse not stop motion
ah okay so this stop-motion mode is a
time lapsement okay game time this
thing's amazing I thought it said Street
Fighter yeah she says game times
Fighters and then at a glance this looks
like the PlayStation classic but it
actually says game station classic game
well I mean it does feel nice it has a
radio on you so that's good another
feature that my Samsung doesn't have
this toggle is kind of weird
screen recorder
it's missing some features
it reminds me of iOS a little bit
like toggles brightness location
Let's test out this fingerprint together
which is also in the power button
it worked okay
I can see this being a good
budget option
the camera is
okay like you're not gonna really get
level details in here
um I have to test it out to see how it
holds up over time
but six gigs of RAM no later six gigs of
RAM only limited ads
let's see
all right shooting for my s22 plus you
get the wall is
I mean you get some texture from the
wall
the quote Oh man my post is still kind
of washed out it's kind of sad but
you do get a three times telephoto Zoom
you get more accurate colors it kind of
widened it
so you can always punch in more but
there's still no texture on the wall
okay we're gonna have to do a camera
shooter because
obviously the ultra wide and the
well there's no ultra light on here but
there's a macro so there's a
and it can detect
it looks I mean I like how the screen
feels
I mean they have worse in every way MP5
is very strange because it's clearly
made recently but it has none of the
perks of being modern okay connect to
the TV via composite cables that's just
weird
podcast I'm just going to keep talking
about this
smartphone
okay
so I'm gonna take a picture
yeah
I took a picture of my screen
uh let me enlarge
I'm gonna fast forward through all of
this until he gets to the smartphone
hopefully you don't mind
[Music]
I'm actually gonna need this
oh yeah the digital video camera that
that was interesting it has night vision
oh hello Shifty eyes Shady
I might actually stay a little bit
longer reacting really reacting to this
video I fast forwarded to do it in a
little bit I might rewind for you and
I got a phone I'm testing this out
and of course I have a buy me a coffee
link if you like to support the channel
um so I'm looking at the phone
my face is
well
you can see for yourself zoomed in
very blowing
s22 plus I know this isn't fair by the
way I know I know but I'm just gonna
like demonstrate
wait my face is worse
I mean sure the colors may be more
accurate what about text maybe got the
text better okay so the text is legible
in that image I don't know the
spelling's kind of punching above its
weight class
okay wait let me see okay I'll put the
two faces together zoom in
no you can still see more detail in my
well it's two different images so I
don't know it's kind of lit together
let me see you can see the text clearly
from which she goes saying and he'll
comment
and
so you gotta go see you later
I don't know about this
this yes the Samsung is better but
build it I mean that's kind of
embarrassing for Samsung well it's
really good for TCL
all right so 12.5 megapixel camera the
haptics absolutely awful
oh the camera doesn't take that one wait
let me see let's see how long it takes
to
do it like took it out around
all right
now this is a well-lit environment so
I'm going to turn off
my front light
and I'm gonna flip around the camera
say cheese see
remember that okay we go into the
settings it has space Beauty on
okay so not that many features in the
camera settings
it's on the best of the best okay
all right I took a front-facing picture
uh very grainy
kind of wash that let me take a
front-facing picture on this one
let's see this one
also kind of grainy but it gets more
details I guess but I like this one
better because it has I guess the face
beauty thing Timberland
let's see what my eyebrows look like
okay so it kind of Smooths over that
well my eyebrows are a lot Fuller in
here so that may be the face beauty
thing let me let me try this again
nope my eyebrows are much
further in this thing I mean look at
this my other eyebrows are just a blue
in this in this image it's kind of sad
all right let's do a speed test again I
know not Phil but we gotta compare and
this is the only thing I can compare to
I have an LG phone we can also compare
it to so let's see
uh
okay let's do Samsung internet and
Chrome let me bring this down for you
guys
well I'll just tell you okay
oh that's not fair because it had to set
up
so
let me let's redo that let's clear all
close all Samsung internet and Chrome
okay so Samsung internet oh Shifty eye
Shady says he needs a new phone woohoo
we can help them we will help if you
find a new phone what specs do you need
and let's keep going through this so I
just do camera
oh the TCL loads faster
um
let's see now I do have a different
launcher on
my 100 200 screen decimal faster but
this feels smooth if you know what I
mean
like
my thing feels more my s20 plus goes
Snappy this feels more
smooth
um
let's see
let me open Gmail
okay it says his coming phone is an old
iPhone XR what what kind of phone are
you looking at
now I can see how the screen is whoops I
can see xcc 700 pixels on the icon
it's not a 1080p screen I think this
might be an LCD so
Gmail loads faster even though it's not
turned on okay
oops oops
I need more memory do you like your old
iPhone XR because I'd suggest you just
get an iPhone 14 or 13. I want to say
good skitter 13.
all right let's see what the blacks look
like on here let's see I'm gonna pull up
one orange Blaster black
black something I don't know we'll pull
up the same image black image okay
oh the keyboard
let's see
I have 64 gigabyte in depth yeah I know
get an iPhone 13 uh 64.
I just think SIM card not found I
connected you to Wi-Fi did it lose
connection
I mean if it's losing connection that's
kind of a issue right there all right
let's see let's do this black uh
and my battery is Warped and dying
quickly yeah do you wanna you still want
an iPhone it says it can't connect to my
network
what's wrong with it
iPhone 13 is nice yeah I'd say get that
all right
okay come on connect to my Wi-Fi
all right finally it's connected so
we're gonna see how good the screens are
see this OLED black Starry Night from
unsplash
and then let me reload try again
it's having some I've been thinking of
maybe switching to Android yeah
all right if you want an Android phone
the obviously better ecosystem oh my
goodness
the obviously better ecosystem I'd say
get a
s
C uh s23 is a nice phone
um there's the LG if I annually it's
loading there's the LG uh
that LT sorry this is some good Motorola
phones in there
and just depends on the specs you're
looking for
so if you tell me the specs you want I
can it is the only Apple device I have
this iPhone okay
black stars
the haptics here they have to reiterate
just bad and it's not getting hot
it's my phone getting hot I mean it's
kind of getting hot
okay so we got this
great background of black stars
having some connection issues oh there
we go
I'm gonna download it and I do I can't
tell that the colors are
washed out
I'm going to open the download
ing 64 gigabytes of memory you have
plenty of phones with more than 64
gigabytes of memory in fact
all right I'm downloading my image
we're going to open the gallery we've
got Samsung gallery and Google photos
quality camera okay
have you considered the s23 plus I mean
s23
all right so I got
come on roaching oh it has a rotate
button that's nice just like my Samsung
okay so we got some black stars here on
the TCL
and then we got some black stars here on
the Samsung Samsung has an OLED this has
a vision booster thingy on it
all right rotate
full screen and I can't notice the
difference
the stars look more white on the thing
on the TCL I mean sorry on the Samsung
and they look more blue on the TCL
the TCL also the black looks kind of
off while the black hair looks deeper
this is I'd say Samsung's is one of us
but this is a 200 phone so
I know I know about anything about
Samsung on the music up look
I know this is going to be kind of
controversial but again Nest 23 I go
down there again that's 23. it's like my
phone but better go check it out great
um so yeah screen it okay the camera for
selfies this actually looks good I'm not
recommending this do not get this by the
way
um I like the amount of storage that's
on this thing what's it 128. but there's
a phone that's worse than this and I'm
gonna show it to you guys
all right here we go
there's a phone that lives in this I'm
going to show it
here you go
I could very quickly get used to this
line but this is a solid mechanism so
each of these hands are pretty firm love
lifting the laptop
above my legs
there's also some good mid-range phones
do you like mid-range phones uh
like
processing power or whatever right here
it is
um here's his phone it's hot mix I can
already tell this is going to be such a
difficult transition
trying to live with a wish.com it's not
like a bad experience that you might
expect that is okay you can tolerate
that this is dysfunctional okay listen
to this you put your sim card in no
signal you try and charge the thing now
some go over 35 never in my life have I
ever seen that before but then the worst
thing is I couldn't figure out why this
thing is
oh my goodness that's just awful
all right and we're gonna close off this
stream before listeners and so I'm
probably gonna post in my buy me a
coffee not the second order link we're
gonna just keep talking about this I'm
probably not a good 10 minutes all right
so
facts
Let's test out the audio quantity you
see is there a recorder on this thing
because audio quality is an important
thing to consider there's no recorder on
here so I'm going to go to in online I
don't do a lot with my phone processing
wise oh okay so how about a mid-range
phone now you said you want a good
camera but coming from an iPhone XR that
could be okay
that that could be man it's oh oh I
can't believe I've got this uh see if
the eye Shady think about this sorry
um I'm so sorry get a pixel 7A it's
cheaper but get a pixel 7 or 7A if you
like smartphones get a pixel 78 if you
can deal with the 6.4 inch phone get a
pixel set just right there
why does my
TCL 40x Pro keep disconnecting
that sorry get it get a 7A or seven
get a pixel set
there you go
I'm so sorry for getting forgetting
about that phone
I don't know why it keeps disconnecting
from my Wi-Fi
yeah the pixel 7 you can get it cheap on
eBay
it is really disconnected from my Wi-Fi
really weird for some reason
and it's on autoconnect
and I know my Wi-Fi is working because
I'm streaming on it
so if this phone cannot keep a signal
I mean this is just kind of fun I do all
my workplace oh that's nice
okay we're going to go to Google
recorded and we're going to test out the
audio quality on distinct
and guys I know it's not a favorite
competition it's just like I mean if you
guys want to send in cell phones for me
to test I mean I
I'd be more than happy
I'd be more than happy to but we have to
we have to let's see
oh my goodness if this phone disconnects
from Wi-Fi one more time
it's in I I don't get it why is it
disconnecting from Wi-Fi so much it
cannot hold a signal
oh my goodness
no internet look at this screen
I have connected it to Wi-Fi already
it keeps
connect
I know my Wi-Fi is kind of bad but it's
not this bad
okay
there we go we're going to online voice
recorder.com because of course and I'm
going to record something uh that's the
actual fight okay I'm gonna record
something on both phones at the same
time and I'm going to listen back to the
uh
online voice recording
right we're on the same website on the
same Wi-Fi and about the same distance
and it just disconnected from the
internet already
oh it's back it's back it's back okay
then my internet was restored how nice
three and I can actually see the screen
let me let me let me uh update the
brightness there we go
three two one
no microphones found sound recording is
unavailable on my phone oh yeah yeah for
some reason my phone my s22 Plus
is having problems with the microphone
it's just weird so I'm gonna restart it
sometimes it doesn't record audio
but let's allow this to see
yeah okay here we go Samsung Galaxy s23
Ultra okay
let's listen
let me turn this up
full volume you go oh it has live
caption that's nice
Samsung Galaxy s23 will it's pretty good
it's pretty good let's see what YouTube
can do let's see
yeah this is the essential apps will use
YouTube phone app camera and it's
holding up pretty well
all right let's see uh but the thing is
it's losing connection I don't know if
you need to restart
I need to take this outside to see if it
how how it can hold up outside
hello Steve Pogue we're looking at the
tcl40xl have you heard of this it keeps
losing connection for some reason I'm on
YouTube
let's see let's search for something
all right okay
we're on the tech boy
it keeps losing connection oh wait it's
package back
all right
wait did I lose a subscriber oh my
goodness I lost a subscriber all right
let's see uh last week's I've seen the
Excel on them yeah I got this on a prime
Day deal
three two
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
that sounds good and fooled and it's
actually this one's really good
wait this is kind of weird though
oh yeah the screen looks really bad
let's see how high I can go up let's see
outside being 4K video
um but the audio quality thing it
shocked me
an audio quality shocked me but the
YouTube apps uh I think it's an LCD I
think it's an LCD
according to the about me phone a
section of the phone
it has a 720 by 16 1 600 display
all right here we go we got a 8K 12K
20 FPS Dolby video
that's an ad
and then one of the comment says we're
here to test our phone quality here yeah
I want it I don't know why the YouTube
app looks like this though like on my
phone
uh on my phone
YouTube
no it isn't dark mode but it doesn't
look so flat does YouTube look different
on your phones guys
like I have a special icon back on it so
whatever
sometimes described as a box that come
and go
maybe let's see someone's
I can actually see myself live on here
that's a bit nice all right like I have
dark Mode YouTube
maybe that's just what YouTube looks
like in light mode I don't know
it's having a nice time
scrolling
all right let's see let's see what the
phone does here
I got it
okay
according to YouTube this can go up to
21
60p we'll see if this loads we'll wait
for that and then I'm gonna go to the
video on my YouTube
4K 8K video
color boost
it's having a hard time loading that
2160p video
let's see on and on my phone see if we
have an ad
I'm gonna turn the volume off on both
phones
I like how the power button and volume
are the same what I don't like is this
UI for some reason the
volume control is here when it makes
more sense on the side but whatever all
right it's loading on mine but it's in
lower quality it's too
it's 126 pin
oh it loaded instantaneously
it's kind of oh there we go wow
wow look at this
that is beautiful
you can even zoom in
and it's still struggling over there on
the
TCL
but you know most people don't watch 12
20p content on on their phone okay
uh let's see uh where do you watch it oh
it's it went 720p oh
it only went to 723.
it failed oh I like that animation the
uh vibration is bad but the animation is
nice you got an office suite on here
only 720p video though dang
and the same kind of video recording
what you have here okay this is a mid
light scenario no flash
at 1080p
30 FPS that that's
the best it can do I'm gonna like pan
around
there you go
and um here we go on the s20 plus
oh yeah the colors here are more I don't
know accurate
well not more accurate this looks more
yellow let's see
oh I forgot what what setting was to set
oh it's a fhd60 so yeah we can go up to
4k on this thing though
all right I'm gonna zoom in onto that
sign
oh net sign is a oh
I don't want to turn on sticky keys
all right there we go that sign is a
blue
my poster is a blue
well Hugh
you can kind of see it
and it is a bit more yellow in this room
than this like it's immediately that my
wallet's white it is not
and what about Zoom does it fall apart
on Zoom
I am an auto photo I'm gonna zoom in as
much as I can
all right all right here we go
it has some type of AI mode whatever
so I'm going to take a picture both on
four times zoom and you're going to have
to guess which one came from the TCL
okay so phone one and I'm gonna kind of
like crop in for you guys
this is phone one
four times
this is phone two for a time zone
kind of
crop in for you guys all right rotated
full screen
which one did you like better phone one
or phone two
I mean in phone one you can see the
detail in the wall from two left
kind of like an oil painting that was a
nice animation out of the filter though
and that's a good one there too
all right let's see uh 10 more minutes
10 more minutes
um I like the notification shade here
but it's
it it's missing like
it's really big oh there's a reading
mode
well it turns everything black and white
boom got a nothing phone right here
okay
let's see if my internet's still up
let's see
nope
it keeps losing connection that is a
problem that is a big problem let me see
all right we have power off reset all
right here we go
all right so I'm restarting the phone it
might
you know be having those problems just
because you know it's brand new out of
the box but I haven't even connected any
Google apps or services to it
and we'll probably do this let's we'll
do a speed test right now we'll do email
browser messages
oh Steve folks says the phone doesn't
need to load it 21p the phone yep yep
that's what I'm saying it seems pretty
nice for people who don't need much from
their phones it does except for this one
problem where it keeps disconnecting
from Wi-Fi that's a problem
720p limit yeah
uh yeah
yeah of course of course I'm not saying
this is a bad phone it looks like a good
phone it has a 90 Hertz screen the
processor looks capable the haptics are
awful the camera looks decent but if it
keeps disconnected from Wi-Fi that's the
problem I also like this there's a nice
big screen you can see your YouTube
video
and because it's so big you got a nice
speaker
oh and but no 5G that's one of the
problems too
and
but for 200 decent
I can't say this is better than Aaron's
wish.com phone all right let me put in
my password
does this phone have a dark mode I hope
it does
because I might hide some of the pixels
in a white mode
where's my password oh
wait
uh it's having some problems letting me
put my password in
it looks like it's only accepting some
of the digits even though Android 13
accepts more digits this is a massive
problem
this is
like if this is broken
I've lost money
so this is a massive problem
and it keeps accepting input from the
fingerprints again stop that
and I I can't see the password like on
most phones you can see what you're
typing in but
write a delete
oh my oh this is bad this is bad
stop it
yep
so the problem we have here
is that the phone it accepted
my password
with more than
16 digits but it's not accepting more
than 16 digits at the lock screen
that that is not good
this is the problem we're gonna have to
reset it
is still connected to my Wi-Fi so that's
good
let's restart
all right so we have about a few minutes
left
but this phone here
obviously not for everyone I'm gonna
switch to it probably for like tomorrow
shift the eye shading this is nothing to
be laughing about this this is serious
serious business right here
let's see if I can reset it on stream
and let's see if I can put into recovery
mode and see if anyone contributed to my
buy me a coffee
I'm gonna log in
all right let me put in my password
wait how many characters this is
accepting
I'm [ __ ] Google it I'm sure you can
figure it out 100 yep of course I can
figure it out
all right let's see I'm gonna put in it
says power off the phone so I'm gonna
hold this down for eight seconds one two
three four five six seven eight one two
three four five six seven eight press
the power key and the volume up key into
into the Android system recovery and
then we're going to factory data reset
it thankfully we didn't put in uh
uh
what you call a Google account FRP like
on it or anything right so
if you guys can see this
unfortunately you're gonna have to reset
this
shame
uh yeah so I probably won't want to put
sensitive data on here
can't even support a long password a
loser anyway let's see if anyone
uh okay no donation check but if you
want to donate to my buy me a coffee of
course you can do that and we'll get
this phone reset up
we'll get this phone reset up reconnect
to Wi-Fi
and everything like that and I'll update
you guys on that so
you guys have been great fans great fans
and truly I thank you for joining this
two hour 19 minute long stream I will be
using this phone for yourself as I guess
some of those so I'm going to be testing
it and then I'm going to sell it on eBay
and speaking of eBay I'm selling a
tablet on well I was selling a tablet on
me but I don't know if the auction ended
but I sell stuff on eBay to make money
for the tech point and then I'll use
that money to buy another better phone
to make money buy another phone
would you like to buy it I'd be willing
to sell this to you on eBay for 200 to
230.
I think that's what they agreed to not
you but
the price that I was gonna save
as I I've already gave my OnePlus 7 Pro
away uh well I sold it for a little bit
but I would give it where's the link to
buy your coffee oh yes yes I'll I'll
gladly put it down there buy me a
coffee.com oh okay you don't need it
okay I'm just checking some sometimes
