<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 22823 Samsung S22 Plus Camera Review</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast all right hello everybody this
is the tech Boy the video that's playing
is lagging but that's okay because we're
just going to play it from the media
player player right here so let's move
on to our transition I'll just have to
turn the camera off and move in to our
um
Regular um video BL so that we can see
our brand new Samsung Galaxy s22 plus
camera review we have a 50 megapixel
camera here um a 12
megapixel uh camera and a 6 time zoom
I'm sorry yeah Ultra wide camera here so
it's going to be really interesting to
see what we have here and let's get to
it so let me just deactivate the camera
so I can get the camera up and running
on the other end and okay
am I gone I should be
gone where's the
camera bye all right and now you can see
that I've transitioned to here and okay
my camera should be
up there I am all right let me just
close out of the program you can see my
website and let's get to the Galaxy s22
plus camera
showcase I went to um Sugarland Town
Square Cur this time lapse here I'm just
going to be zooming in on stuff as you
can see I will probably record this with
the main camera oh you can't zoom in
let's see it's not letting me zoom in oh
well um you can see the tree here is
kind of a bit un Overexposed the
um trees here kind of look smudgy and
blotchy but you know it's just a time
lapse so and I'm probably Dr in a bit
and you can kind of also see how the
lights are Overexposed or these lights
are kind of properly
exposed and here is a video of me
walking through downtown Houston during
their Christmas setup
fixture as you can see here the lights
aren't
really um let's see if I can go frame by
frame oh that's
me you can't really zoom in and see the
lights it's not that much detail here
but it is a pretty good
it has good background good foreground
you can see all the lights here you can
see people accurately demonstrating the
colors um if we rewind just a bit you
can see that the trees do look kind of
dark there but you can see that these
people here are correctly
exposed and this is just me according to
fireworks Over Town Square in the
dark hear the music in the
background and this is a scenario that
we sometimes came across with where I
try to record out of a car window and
the spots you see here are actually the
water droplets there so this is just a
real life in the real world moving
driving trying to record stuff scenario
and now we're going to our Zoom mode uh
30 times Zoom uh helicopter you can see
it's not that much detail there the
helicopter is obviously moving that's a
30 time zoom or I don't know if it's 30
time zoom but it's a zoom in of our uh
dish no sorry um Direct TV satellite
dish
um and then just zoom in from on top of
a building to these buildings
here and this is a zoom in of me going
to a NFL football game the Texans you
can see the referees and the coaches as
a zoom in of the live playing it looks
good on the phone kind of but you can
kind of see the halo around the Jaguars
and Texans plays
uh H helmet is um kind of discon and
then this is just another the wide angle
of the uh this the light fixture
thing
whoa and that's another one and this is
a wide angle camera uh picture you see
some nice overcast they great for taking
pictures and this next shot is going to
be important see I zoom in just the
ultra wide it doesn't capture that much
detail so having a nice high megapixel
rating on the here is okay I mean I
didn't really find a 50 megapixel mode
really important but it would be nice if
we could get a nice megapixel bump to
the ultra white camera if you wanted to
really zoom in on those details as you
can see here the bushes are you can't
really see the Le leaves be clearly
defined excuse me the tree the bricks
here are kind of splatty the little
gutter here is just kind of red and
underexposed there but you know we're
looking at this on a bigger screen so
that's to be expected this is another
video I don't know if I recorded it in
what FPS at dark at night um see if you
can hear
this and this is an example of me using
prom mode this is at church the Bible
study but I mean this could be
considered a concert um so dos jumping
running around um I kind of did a blue
in so that's why it looks blue at the
beginning but then you can
see all right as you can see this is
random picture you can actually see the
license plate uh right there so that's
nice you can see um how the sign is kind
of Overexposed one thing that this phone
does struggle with is slight dynamic
range adjustment so I was recording um
trying to take a picture one time the
light were coming in from uh window far
away here and I just trying to see here
and I hear that the s23 is better
dynamic range so that's good um you can
also see wow look at that detail as you
can see again taking in a car window but
the detail here um you can see uh if you
can see my mouse point but if you can't
just look to the far right of your sorry
left of your screen you can see the
uh sorry what am I trying to say a
walking man right here uh not an actual
man but the
uh walking man for the TR light here and
you can also see how the background is
sorry the backgr yeah it's kind of blue
here and all these lights here so one
thing that Samsung could use better AI
for is
taking pictures out of Windows but you
can also see that there's a nice sunset
here with the trees and the background
and I'm SAR if I cropped into that I
could maybe get a decent image um you
can crop into images just by zooming in
and clicking the little icon on
Samsung's phone I like no article about
that all right and I was uh staying out
of place and I wanted to see if I could
test out Samsung's 50 megapixel mode but
I decided not to put the I don't know
which photos these are but you can see
how incredbly crisp and clean these are
the background is nice and blured you
can see the the individual lines in each
of the little wickle baskets but you can
kind of see that it is kind of smudgy uh
kind of ping on here the white I don't
know look it's kind of a I guess it
didn't really cap it accurately and then
this is kind of a grainy
here this is another I think this is
right angle you can see the entire
Stadium almost all the way at the top
um and I'm pretty sure if you zoomed in
it wouldn't be as good because it's not
a high megapixel camera and I would say
that one time zoom looks better than 7
times zoom and at three times Zoom looks
better than 25 2.5 time zoom because
it's using digital Zooms in between
those intervals and one thing that I
would like to see is that variable
camera like Sony has on their um Sony 1
markv all right here's one I forgot to
touch the screen but you know Samsung's
AI to do a better job I guess I mean if
it I mean it's not that good of a
picture anyway when you can see the uh
the textas says powering the M holiday
tree but the holiday tree I guess like
whatever is um kind of bright too bright
here this has Overexposed the real light
energy uh thing here the grass is out of
touch it's really czy um you can see
some Reflections in the water but
zooming in would just be a mess this
this sky is awful it's just really bad
Pi overall I'm trying to show but you
can see the footprints right here so
nice detail there but then I got a
better one there it is as you can see
here the tree and the um light bulb are
both correctly exposed you can still see
the text that says powering the M's
holiday tree the grass is kind slightly
brighter but this building in the
background this blue light is really
washing it out and that's where damic
greens comes to be a problem also and
also video editing really good on the
phone with new Fusion but does tend to
get kind of hot but good thing is it
feels very sturdy there's not goingon to
break or anything and you can even see
the people back here black uh shirts and
stuff and uh right there and you can
even see how the trees back here are
nice and lit up but this the tree part
like that actual branches and things are
still contrasted but you can see the sky
better so this is an overall better
picture oh there's also you can see the
river you can see that the Christmas
tree or holiday tree whatever is um a
bit too bright I probably should have
touched the screen I wasn't really doing
that and you can also see how the uh
ornament is Overexposed but it is a nice
sky and these Treet branches are also
kind of dark so Samsung you know I don't
think I use night mode but if I use
night mode probably would been
better all right now here is a panorama
photo um with everything that you can
see
and I mean it's okay you can see the
ornament grossly Overexposed here the
tree is okay I mean it's been looking
like that you can see the background but
you can barely see anything here you can
see a building here but the ground I
mean you can barely see it it's very Dy
and grungy and dark I don't know what
camera it's using for the Panorama might
be using the wide angle which is worse
than the regular one so I don't know I
should probably test it right now in
fact I'm going to do it so I'm going to
go to panorama mode we're just going to
Mo um and then click
Panorama um oh it can use a one time
zoom or a point six time zoom so I don't
remember which one I use I could
probably check um and you can't see the
text on the sign anymore so overall I'm
not really that good of a panorama
photo all right now you can see the
building here looks like we're zooming
in it looks like it's 6:55 o00 655
according to the time but these lights
are really rossing it out you don't
really get that much of a detail here as
you can see um towards the bottom of the
building it's really um washed out here
the light still Overexposed on the
ornament but you can still see what it
is um if I can get this to go down I
can't but the sky it's just a really
messy photograph
overall and here's one of those art
fixtures it looks like a good fixture on
the phone but I guess when you zoom in
um blow it up on the big screen it's not
that but I like how you can get the
reflections of the trees on the Windows
um this yeah you can get all the light
here so yeah so BBE Samsung's 50
megapixel mode is useful when viewing
here here's a picture of a photo of a
screen
um yeah the token One Touch
computer I mean it's good I mean this
looks blur because uh the thing is BL
not Samsung's
for all right and now here's just some
expert not expert promoe photos of me
trying to capture the
fireworks that's a good one that's
another good one and then you got the
star correctly exposed here kind of
correctly exposed here I think this is
night mode because you have all this
motion below here and also you can see
the lights that are going into there
that's also nice and if you look really
closely towards the top you can see
these men standing on top of the
building so that's nice really good
detail capturing by Samsung and there
night mode photograph and then there's
this one where Samsung I got the text
correct it says R info or something like
that and then you got the light so we
can see individually each one but the
street light is too exposed you can't
really see the street light
so and then you also have the star kind
of Overexposed with nice St time zoom
picture and that's how we will end our
uh first segment of the podcast all
right so what did you guys think about
the Galaxy s22 plus camera some of these
pictures may have been 50 megapixel
regular photograph it's just trying to
combine it all I
do and that
is um good on with it all right so we
did some Google Lens tips yesterday and
recorded a video about it it's called
Google Lind tips and you can even see
the video
here all right so if you want to watch
that you can watch that over at our
YouTube channel we have over 90 maybe 90
subscribers something like that so 10
more subscribers to 100 and yeah that's
nice so just Google L is really nice if
you're on mobile you can click the
little icon I don't know I think you
have to download it for iOS but if
you're on Android you can click the icon
in the switch bar and just switch
whatever you want you can add some
examples here it's really nice really
useful feature watch the video and read
the article it's also built into Chrome
so that's nice and then one UI finally
finally we got picture and picture
YouTube back insecure folder so that is
nice um but fix one of the secure folded
rugs in run 5.0 Samsung Galaxy photo
remastering is also new it takes the
shadows and highlights out of photos
automatically and Bixby text call which
I mean looks like it's been fighting off
scammers but I just I turn on Bixby text
call and it gives me the text Bixby text
call will be transcribing your text and
they just hang up on me so that's nice
um I've only used it once um if you used
to do the popup Samsung thing you have
to kind of put it down when your phone
comes in to get the full phone call
screen and then click Bixby text call I
used it want to test off from my Google
Voice number to my personal cell phone
number it transcribes things well um I
could hear what was being said by Bixby
in my earphones and what I was typing in
so it's really nice when it's kind of
like a hybrid text phone if you don't
want to text someone and they can't you
know this should be really useful let's
say let's say you're sitting here in
your office right you have to be quiet
and someone else is driving so they have
their headset in they can't really text
you they can talk to you what get
described to you you and then they can
hear you so it's really a really useful
feature I'm glad to see that Samsung and
Google are really fighting out on
features hold my call versus vix Fe text
my call Direct Call so Samsung finally
becoming better at AI instead of just
using its Hardware because I think AI is
going to be useful I mean Samsung look
is erasing Shadows they already have
their own image erase um background you
know I mean eraser oneui 5.1 on the
newest Samsung devices s23 series you
can cut and paste the uh PE background
images out of the background so I really
think it's useful that Samsung is using
doing more AI features so it becomes
more pixeles and I really like Samsung
to bring their uh remove the background
from a photo feature to the s22 series
mean this has the Snap Dragon H in one
yeah it's not the best for battery life
I found that not using a case reduces
heat because it was tracking the heat
inside anyway um yeah not the best
battery but I mean these phones are
still very powerful can probably last
you two three years
um maybe four if you can survive the
battery life and the heat generate
something has 5e security patches so
Samsung could really bring that feature
here can bring it to even some of the a
series devices and um the new battery
widget which is okay doesn't look as
good as the iOS widget but it's nice to
have is um I have it on my
screen and that was it for today so
first of all I want to thank you 90
subscribers for subscribing to my
channel um we filmed a new ad using the
s22 Plus's front facing camera so if you
want to see um what the front facing
camera looks like go check out our
YouTube channel and thanks for watching
this and Tech talk to you later bye</pre>
