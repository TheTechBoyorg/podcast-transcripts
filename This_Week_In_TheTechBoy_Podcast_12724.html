<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 12724</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech booy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
the this week in the tech booy uh
podcast this episode is sponsored by
pesu but we get into I reviews of their
advices this week
and waste of time and garbage spy watch
that this is and we'll get into how this
is a piece of junk later but um yeah so
let's welcome everyone else to the
stream and I will first share this
stream with everyone hello to our first
viewer
um yeah so we have plenty of products to
talk about today we got some Market
talkies from fail thing we got a a MP3
player from pesu and another MP3 player
SL radio from pesu so as I'm showing
this I guess I can talk about the am I
still live yeah there you go I can talk
about the
um this this radio
here right um
yeah let's get into this all so this
radio here simple radio $12 it's
portable so it has this hand strap here
okay it supports regular batteries but
it comes with a rechargeable battery for
some reason it charges with micro USB
not micro USB USB type B charging cable
so I mean if you need an extra TI 84
[Music]
proce if you need a ti8 for plus C
charging cable someone was banging on
the door right there um it comes with it
so that's great all right then you got a
um has an antenna that extends but you
don't really need it all the way to go
up and has four modes you got FM AM and
shortwave radio and then MP3 so in order
to use it what you do is you turn it on
so the on button is at the
top
and it's displ the test file that came
on there other MP3 player from a card
from a MP3 player card so if you want to
play FM radio so I'm going to put you
click the FM
button and then you type in the station
that you want to hear so I want to hear
say 105.7 that's our Christian radio
station so you just type in 1057 really
fast
1057 and then I'm going to turn the
volume back on I'm not talking about it
being a manageable schedu all the
time and then for the same
thing you
got uh AM radio so s radio 1610 and then
short wave you can also do the same and
then for more complete tuning you can go
through and hit this here and it will go
through all
the so 790
740
pretty good player and then it can also
play mp3s through
your
[Music]
uh no here
okay you can play mp3s through your um
SD card slot and your USB flash
drive yeah so there's that all right um
we also reviewed the pesu uh MP3 player
the legitimate MP3 player and it was
pretty good I actually liked
it I mean it it did what it was supposed
to do it gaming performance was
horrendous I install Madden on it for
someone and then they um they started
playing it and all the players started
turning like black triangles so they
started turning into black triangles cuz
SL it was but the music quality was
really good seriously there's this
version of the national Anem on here
that had like all two versus well versus
one and four and it was really good you
could music you could do sound yeah so
I'm going to pull up that review for a
sister pesu M4 I think let me check make
sure it's M4 not
M5 all right so here it is on the screen
this could be the M4 or M5 doesn't
really matter it has a 5 in screen right
um it's is really good inpd play so it
supports up to one t of storage on the
SD external SD card it has a uh I think
it's 60 no 32 gigabytes of internal
storage right and a 3,000 minute battery
now first thing when I saw that size and
then saw the battery specs this on the
back of the box I was like why is it so
small because like it was really thick
it was like half an inch thick but then
I turned it on and it the sound was
really loud okay I mean it was it was
super loud right
um it averaged 81 DB from the speakers
from my phone Sy which is really good
okay that's like probably loud than my
phone actually gets it FS the room right
and you can actually hear stuff okay and
then it has three buttons on the side so
it has the power button which is at the
top and then two two volume buttons and
then oh four foot buttons and then the
uh what's it called the recorder button
I thought okay I thought it might be a
button that could like Control mp3
player which I would have liked cuz that
recorder was trash I mean it was an
atrocity okay that that that recorder
was garbage okay so don't use it for
sound recording okay it had three modes
first of all the software looked like it
was from 2006 it had only three Mo was
high quality low quality and medium
quality okay it it comes out of the box
on medium quality which is trash and
then you can change it to high quality
which is like trash but like less trash
okay
um it's running Android 8.1 oreo with
the Play Store and it's running like a
little custom skin right so there's no
like app draw or anything it's just you
know running the you know stock youi or
whatever
um but the Chinese software was kind of
weird it did ask to T to get the
location of to change the time with the
weird pop up and for some reason it
turned off after like 10 to 15 minutes
of uh in yeah 10 minutes of inactivity
and you have to go change that into
setting like why would you want your
phone because it's basically set and
programmed as a
phone um to tune off after five minutes
of
inactivity 10 minutes of
inactivity and then there's the
uh
the let's see what else is this MP there
was no camera for some reason I didn't
get it we need $60 but still I
mean dang no
camera it's kind of sad in my opinion
um using it is easy can play high
quality photos and videos the video
player looks like it's from 2006 okay it
does have us USBC cable which is
good um so it does have USBC cable split
screening and uh like BL and a radio on
it so and a headphone check so those are
all things that the iPhone 14 doesn't
have and it's like five times than the
iPhone 14 so that's that's good um ma 10
12 13 times G honestly okay it's not a
Powerhouse does have an ebook V it can
download book from Gooden B and that
worked well I downloaded the KJV Bible
um but it I when I tried to download it
on my computer and then transfer it over
like you know normal MP3 players you
download the songs and videos on your
computer transfer them over um it it
didn't work for some reason and then
final thing the web browser on there
okay don't use it it's a piece of truck
thankfully justes have the play store so
I guess you could install Google or
chome if you want it to I'm not sure how
well the performance would be cuz
although the performance inside the apps
was Snappy and everything it is it's
optimized for you know the music playing
like if you try anything else it's not
going to work like that browser terrible
it loaded my website as a full text Page
and I'm surprised it actually was able
to load my website you could barely load
Google okay if you can't load Google
website that's been around for literally
26 years um then I mean it you're
screwed okay
um yeah so yeah that is the pescue info
uh review pretty good and and then thing
speaking of things that aren't pretty
good we got to talk about these Cobra
walkie talkis I mean these are
borderline scams at this point this
they're pie of
junk hopefully you can see this on the
screen okay I bought new walkie-talkies
to replace these and they cost $18 in
bing these cost me
$50 that's pack of three $50 from um
best p and the only good thing about
these walkie talkies is that they give
me great rechargeable batteries for my
Bing Rockie talkis which are better okay
we can talk about those that later
okay these things promised to have a 25
mile vein just out in the forest
somewhere that is not true absolutely
positively not true
okay second of all these walkie-talkies
promised to um give me two to three mile
range the three mile range in the city
okay I live in the city I tested this
for my house and had some f and it got
me 6.64 mile range and then cut out
transmission and you might be thinking
well okay 46 for Miles this may be the
best clearest quality transmission that
has ever been heard on walking talk no
first of all they make you talk way too
close to this microphone hole second of
all every button you push it's beep beep
beep beep beep beep it is super loud
okay like there's no no discretion okay
and um it also undercuts
its like transmission range by like
three four honestly okay piece of junk
honestly overpriced like I got those bar
things for $18 which means a pack of
three of those should cost $9 I can buy
you two packs of them for like $36 but
they did come batteries
so I can see how it could even out but
no don't buy these piece is a junk okay
they do say that they're water resistant
and I'm sure they are I just probably
wouldn't be able to notice because the
transmission while it's under waterer
would probably sound the same thing as
the transmission above ground but not
recommend
okay
um yeah so those are our headlines for
today we talk about some Market talkies
and our pesu info and then next week we
will have our review of
the PCU fas2 radio coming out here and
we just read out the transmission range
and capabilities so can go from fm70 to
108 am 520 to 120 and short wave 230 to
2.95 megahertz okay now speaking of
those B F oh also I forgot to it does
have a headphone jack draing and that's
it now speaking of those bare F walkie
talkies they do have USBC unfortunately
does no charer so this is the one
instance in which I would rather not
have USBC speaking of USBC which this
does not have this thing is a piece of
junk and I am planning on returning it
you may be thinking hey why why Tech boy
do you think this thing is junk okay
first of all the program on here to
change the time got flagged as by AVG as
m
that's right they they loaded mware onto
this spyat okay um second of all whoever
designed this software on the watch I
mean it's it's horrendous okay um so
this's is screen here right and you're
thinking okay there's a nice little
screen right but if you want to activate
spy mode right you have to hold down the
power button for 3
seconds 1 1,00 2 1000 000 3
1,000 and now it's in spy mode so now I
can take pictures by clicking this
button
here V audio by clicking that button
there and then videos by clicking this
button
here you have to hold it
down pretty standard right no because
this thing is going to go away for 15
SEC 15 minutes right so the screen's
going to go away and then you have to
pull that button down to activate spy
mode
again also chares are a micro USB so I'm
not happy about that either so now look
the screen is
off but let's say after a few minutes
it's going to go away and go back to
that home screen right that is dumb
because let's say I'm wearing to watch
and I'm R hour and I say oh wait wait
there's a criminal crossing the street
right there I need this Le take a
picture oh wait let me hold this button
down for 3 seconds and then oh wait okay
I gotta click this and then on top of
that instead of aiming the camera I
don't know right here where your wrist
would actually go so you can you
actually have a sense of where you
aiming no absolutely not can't have any
of that right I mean no you got to aim
it because the camera's like right here
like that but of course that means
you're upside down which means you
probably have to aim it like this it's
completely stupid piece of junk honestly
okay now I'm I'm aware
of
um H how this uh this this works
right but I mean honestly you you could
do better I mean let's look at the
competition here right here's the
competition on
Amazon okay so these are you know toys
those are junk because the videos don't
work
like now here we have here just actually
would make some sense now sure you do
have to hit it like aim it but I mean at
least at least you don't have that
stupid screen though you can it's it's
always on right okay here I don't know
how the software works or anything right
um it's a
toy but I mean
it's it's garbage honestly
[Music]
so
like this watch doesn't really do
anything but you know what it does do
something the s24 ultra and I really
really want s24 Ultra okay like my phone
is good but it I mean s24 Ultra but just
make my phone experience so much better
and we've already talked about that like
the battery life apparently is so good
on the s24 ultra better heat management
now Mr Boss did say that the signal
wasn't good so that's not good but I'm
not sure maybe it's his Network he's
over there in the UK so you could have
got a bad model
um I'm pretty sure is he stuck with xnos
I'm not
[Music]
sure and of course you got those AI
features which I did hear the AI is
coming to s23 ultra which means I could
get
a
s23
Ultra uh phone s23 Ultra phone for way
less I mean you can get those for four
$500 now so I mean maybe I'll be able to
pick one
up
some of my Amazon money together you
know it would be cool because I make the
news videos there
um there you go here is our M
review only I get them much cheaper I
save hundreds of dollars a month by the
Galaxy s24 Ultra has had a controversial
launch oh my God AI That's amazing wait
do they just make the cameras work 7even
years of software support are you
kidding this chipset is a thermal
nightmare I don't know what he's talking
about I've been seeing it I've been
reading it while I have also been
testing it this is my definitive review
of Samsung's flagship phone of the year
the s24 ultra okay so here's what I'm
going to say I did was have C screens
because to make
Samsung special I guess it did stick out
oh we got to talk about the OnePlus 12
too OnePlus 12 looks amazing now it does
have 4,500 L of brightness
which like where are you going to be
where it's so bright like you have to be
like literally right there for it to be
that bright for you to actually activate
the that mode and also whether or not
I'm going to be permanently replacing my
iPhone for it so let's start with the
outside even though some we all know
what the design looks like right so we
just go and Skip through this because
it's 26 minutes long oh he's talking
about the animation sh this is key this
is key the moment I try to share the
content from them it just gets
compressed beyond belief it's this kind
of stuff and I honestly came into the
s24 ultra yeah I don't really use like I
could this about Instagram stories and
social media and stuff you know talking
about the camera downgrade the software
is like kind of
aggressive notg annoying way now more
than ever it really pushes you towards
Samsung services like Samsung pass to
store your passwords So eventually you
just get fed up of it so you click okay
yeah yeah
okay the cameras are like an a update
upgrade you got some AI new AI editing
features which feel authentic to
him is where it's like you hit the
editor then you hit the generative
editor you do your tweaks you confirm
your tweaks you wait for about 10
seconds and then you hit done it's still
a bit long considering that in a big day
out you might take 30 photos you're not
going to do that 30 times and that is
actually a pretty good segue into Galaxy
AI in general what I've been really
trying to work out over the last few
weeks is are these AI features actually
groundbreaking or are they just gimmicks
I'll start with the good news all of
this instant translation stuff that
actually has me buzzing I've never
mentioned this before but part of my
extended family is Italian and I mean
like proper Italian so it's often not
the easiest to communicate but check
this out this is what I do now when I
enter the chat it already knows that I'm
wanting to talk in Italian so it's got
the Italian translator preloaded I type
my message into that translator wait a
couple of seconds and then the
translated text appears in my WhatsApp
chat window ready to hit send and the
fact that it is that's right and it is
off offline so that's good because that
means your message is not being sent to
suus and it's faster just set it and
forget it the fact that it knows in
which chats you want the translation and
in which chats you don't the fact that
it works across all your different
messaging apps like SMS WhatsApp
Instagram H Google messages is it's
still not there it's absolutely amazing
it means you're going to talk more with
people you otherwise might not it means
you're going to be able to express
yourselves better and also people like
being talked to in their own language
it's funny actually my sister-in-law was
so taken aback by my sudden Italian
fluency she genuinely thought someone
had hacked my phone and called my mom to
check now it isn't perfect the
translation isn't instant and Samsung's
quality of translation is definitely not
as good as Googles like if I type in is
this Italian working BTW Samsung gets
very confused whereas Google understands
that BTW means by the way and then makes
the translation accordingly and well
yeah but I mean it wouldn't make sense
in my opinion to use English acronyms or
artics in someone else's language
because then can l in Translation also
better understand if something is a
question especially if they like
languages like say Russian where the
alphabet are completely different even
if you've not explicitly added a
question mark and you are still going to
run into dialect problems current
translation tools are good for simple
requests but actually trying to have a
conversational tone is still not quite
possible because a lot of things don't
Translate literally but first stab this
is pretty awesome because Samsung has
now set the precedent for what one day
absolutely will be a game changer the
other thing that's been surprisingly
useful is the AI summarization features
like while I'm on Android I've always
been a Google Chrome user I'm now
actively choosing to use the Samsung
browser because of the summaries I don't
use it all the time but let's say you
hop onto a Samsung internet Forum
discussion post this AI can actually
read everything that every single person
has written and then give you a 30
second summary of all the key opinions
and that same from the set AI technology
also helps you out with your notes I've
mentioned this before but my notes used
to be a big old mess because of the
chaotic yeah I needed that I was like oh
man I really want this and I want to see
if you get like a the Samsung not of
that no nature of thoughts and my notes
being the way that I keep track of those
thoughts they're the one part of my
digital life that's had no trace of
organization but this phone changes that
for starters while every note would
normally be whatever grammar my keyboard
spits out in the moment the AI grammar
checker here actually makes those notes
feel like way more composed deliberate
thoughts which then in turn makes you
want to look after them and organize
them the way it formats your notes too
like if I'm writing a list of holiday
destinations the thing will actually
categorize them based on continent which
is exactly how I would have done it but
it just would have taken me like 10
times as long and then to finish the
whole thing off the phone even generates
AI powered covers for your notes that is
so nice which kind of pack packages each
one into what feels like its own
distinct novel almost it'll even go
through and read through the handwritten
writing on those notes for info about
what to title the note now I do think
the phone should just do this
automatically as opposed to you having
to click generate but still compare this
to my iPhone Notes Library there is a
world of difference and on that note yes
there is still an S Pen in and I would
use that daily scrubbing for Luma
Fusion uh remote shutter
this phone and for me it's one of those
things that I completely forget it
exists 99% of the time and some part of
me wishes Samsung had just swapped it
out for an even bigger battery no until
the 1% of times where I really need it
and I count my lucky stars that it's
right there in front of me there's
something that feels very free form
about writing as opposed to typing which
is why whenever I'm ideating I'll always
use my remarkable tablet but do you know
what this has kind of absorbed the
functionality of that too being able to
just whip this S pen out and write even
when my phone's locked so I'm not
getting distracted it pretty much ticks
the same box my only complaint is that I
really feel like it should be on this
side given that I imagine most people
are going to be writing with their right
hands and so would want to take it out
from here I imagine the reason they've
done this is the cameras now take up a
little bit too much space to put it on
that side but Samsung didn't want to
move the cameras because that's become
their branding all right so then we've
got Circle search kind it would look
kind of weird too which is basically
hold the bottom part of your screen and
you enter this new mode this mode where
you can take whatever's on your screen
zoom in zoom out move around and when
you're ready Circle something and I
wonder how this would work for say like
you know apps like Snapchat which don't
let you screenshot apparently I'm
sophisticated and do not procure in
Snapchat anyway
um let's say if this would work because
maybe the phone wouldn't know that
you're trying to take a screenshot
Google will tell you what it is for the
first 5 days of using this phone I
actually completely forgot got this
feature existed CU you know your default
is to use your phone interesting he's
using S2 Ultra here for ult and then he
has iPhone watch Apple the way you
already know how to use your phone
Circle to search requires a very
conscious shift in how you think about
searching but when it clicked for me it
clicked hard this feature is absolutely
incredible you see a photo of a cool
product and you want to know what it is
circle you see a photo of a phone you
don't recognize Circle you want to re
whatever flowers are in the house Circle
to find out exactly what they are you
see a photo of the most beautiful hotel
View Circle it to find out exactly which
hotel it is and I am continuously
surprised how accurate it is it's very
easy for a feature like this to just be
a gimmick this is actually based on
something Google made years ago called
now on tap where you hold down your home
button and your phone tells you exactly
what's on your screen before just it was
a gimmick then but the seamlessness how
it doesn't exit the app you're currently
in meaning you can find out what you
want to find out out and with one swipe
be back where you were the fluidity how
you can Circle you can scribble you I
like those just tap and the phone always
seems to get what you're trying to
highlight and then the intelligence of
the results makes this I'm going to say
game changing category like just
yesterday this is going to sound like
one of the most first world situations
ever we got this snack in my kitchen on
the opposite side to where I was sitting
I just remembered we were running out of
that snack and I wanted to top up but I
couldn't remember what they were called
so pulled out my Samsung zoomed all the
way into that snack entered Circle to
search and within about 5 Seconds that
exact wow that's that's amazing Hightech
right to do product was in my Amazon
basket now obviously that's a dumb
example but I think it kind of
illustrates how Circle to search almost
opens the floodgates to what becomes
searchable it makes your phone genuinely
feel like your own personal interactive
interface with the world and now picking
up my iPhone which doesn't have it it
feels old school and then the final AI
feature that I like is the instant
slowmo it's a top tier idea with good
execution it just needs a bit of Polish
sometimes looks like it's dropping a few
frames
oops when you use it the video will
either lag at the start till the phone
catches up or create weird artifacts as
it's not quite able to insert the
perfect in between frames when slowing
videos down okay using you know math to
figure out what's gonna happen there is
some stuff that I don't like like the
live call translation which is
significantly worse than the text
message translation basically because
it's the same thing but all of a sudden
has to happen in real time to be clear
I'm really glad Samsung's made this it
just needs to get better let me give you
an example I'm trying to decide between
pineapple on pizza and pineapple on
pasta what do you think I should go
for I think you should go to
[Applause]
jail oh yeah and uh if you're enjoying
this video then a sub to the channel
would be jeans wait a moment oh yes
jeans you could just use my mom maybe
what that's not what you were trying to
say right so do you have a sub to the
channel word fantastic wonderful the
best YouTube channel yes we got there
there's also some more General caveats
Worth bearing in mind for all of this AI
stuff one that a lot of Samsung's AI is
actually based on Google tech and so
even some of the things that Samsung
made seem like an exclusive almost
definitely will not stay that way for
very long two yeah that a lot of these
AI features aren't actually going to
require you to buy the
s24su not being made clear so you feel
like you need to buy the new thing and
then three is the fine print the little
disclaimer that we all knew would pop up
as soon as we found out that a lot of
these AI features are relying on
Samsung's online servers that the online
AI features are only going to be free
until the end of 25 I think they might
change that I don't like it because you
know the company comes on stage and they
say our new phone does this amazing
thing and like these s24 phones they're
expensive so naturally most people are
going to assume that price is your price
of Entry to use those features that's
how it's worked with every single phone
up until this point so having this
hidden charge to use necess mean iPhones
you be like oh we got this iCloud
storage um
so you know headline feature you're
launching your phone with doesn't sit
well with me and yes Samsung is taking
on extra cost from the servers they're
going to have to use to host these AI
requests I get that AG three Snapdragon
AI buil into it I mean it should be able
to you
know but then either don't release the
feature till it can run without that or
don't sell it as a feature of the phone
because it's not then it's a feature of
your servers and yes they're saying the
AI will be free till the end of 2025 but
if anyone buys this phone now then even
if you're just on a short 24-month plan
you will still just enter the period
where you will have to hand over your
credit card details for what could well
be yet another monthly
subscription on top of the monthly fees
you're already paying for your data on
top of the price of the phone it's like
that pin thing the Humane pin is like
$700 plus like mobile data subscription
plus like another mobile data
subscription for an actual phone that
you're actually going to
use okay I've had my moan so final
couple of things before we bring this
all together in case I didn't already
make this clear this is also the fastest
Samsung I've ever used but what happens
when you push it well I have recently
come to the realization that the
PlayStation 2 can finally be properly
emulated on Android
phones so that's uh three generations
behind and bear in mind emulation is a
very resource intensive task cuz it's
not just that your phone has to run a
game it's actually that it has to use
its power to simulate a completely
different set of Hardware that the game
was originally designed to run on but
this thing can do it this phone is
powerful enough that I was plain sailing
through my entire childhood library of
PS2 games including upscaling look at
that square right there them to run in
HD and that is about as demand a thing
as you can ask a phone to do now I
wonder if we can run Windows on it that
in itself is kind of a sore spot too cuz
I do really want to start seeing phone
companies not just dropping a load of
big numbers in our lap and saying here
you go have fun but actually helping to
create reasons for that power to exist
exactly that's why I really want virtual
machine applications to come to Android
especially Android tablets like a not
like limbo PC emulator I mean like
Android uh 15 or 14 phones get like I
don't know work with Rockstar to bring
GTA 5 to the
phone she was just
coming
[Music]
m
so what we have here is this phone that
um Can can run that games and stuff I
don't really care about games I want to
be doing like productive stuff on here
and this is going to transition us two
of period which and iess guess we can do
the big reveal
later on if he tries to the
phone I got a real actual wi-fi hacking
antenna with USBC and I was able to hack
into my Wi-Fi network finally thank
goodness you know what's next
um
uh so I'm going to put up virtual VM
workstation which isn't supposed to be
used for commercial use hopefully
they're don't AR me
um yeah and we're going to do some uh
cyber security stuff so let's see here
[Music]
uh so this is a USBC uh Alpha antenna
here it also comes with a clip so you
can put on top of your computer
Nintendo's USBC I can plug it into this
us USBC on
my uh phone laptop sorry but it also
comes with this clip here which turns
into usba so that was really smart of
them and you have to make sure to
install the correct drivers it's online
you don't have to go to like shade to
download them from my disc or anything
it's pretty easy for me
um so I'm telling you it finally Works
some finally something actually happened
that worked without me having to like
install random dep sees and goes like
the deepest depths of the internet just
to get my stupid little antenna working
again um just have to like screw it
on then you got these uh internet here
it works over 5 gtz I was able to hack
my 5 gz Network on the first try I mean
it stupid oh my
gosh there you
go and when it's on it has this like
blue light it's kind of like fighting me
right now you kind of have to put the
USBC Cable in the right way even though
there's no right way you got to put it
in Alpha set up I think
okay maybe I'll do the regular USB mode
just
because I
don't so I'm gonna plug it into
here figure hacking article let's see
hacking
Wi-Fi tools
ah let's use Wi-Fi here we go Wi-Fi 2
it's on GitHub all right so I'm going to
showare my screen and I'm put the
commands in right I'm starting on my Ki
Dro hopefully you can see the
screen and I'm just going to show you
the the the beauty of this this
technology you
go
I wonder if you can hack with WPA2
because that's what we
have so what you got to do is you
install click these commands I'm just
logging into my c network
here did I tell you guys this is my
first spy Chase uh since
2019 uh uh yeah so I learned my lesson
so always look at satellite images for a
good Escape Route
um beforehand you know take that at hot
kids um who are out there listening and
wondering what the heck I'm talking
about so the member kids if uh you want
to go into that
business okay it's loading it's loading
this see we have on our phone okay okay
so AI Network thing is loading and as it
is loading let us talk about the OnePlus
12
okay not the 12 R just talk about the 12
let's learn more about this phone here
okay I mean I asked OnePlus for this
phone they wouldn't give it to me
so okay it it redefines meaning of
smooth seemless blah blah blah blah okay
so that's great animations which I mean
that's great but could you figure out
how to animate your website uh maybe
it's my virtual machine though okay got
the H gen3 okay we got 16
G okay like last year 98% fast AI
perform well I mean that is completely
true probably because the last year's
chip didn't have any AI performance
course like none because it wasn't an AI
chip okay 30% faster CPU
performance wow 100% faster read 512
gigabytes of storage and a 5,000 Point
Milli battery I mean this is honestly
the s24 ult is equal except for you know
the uh what's it called
Espin SM cooling
speeds
and now you can also type in the rain
which is good I needed that
yesterday let's see I have here I wonder
what's faster CU my phone's been lagging
so like faster Abes and smooth switching
matters to me uh smooth screens matters
to me okay let's see what kind of camera
system we have okay we got an ultra
white camera system right right and then
three times zoom and then a light
identifier so that's that's just it for
show iess yes like I mean it's there but
it's not like a four lens camera system
I think okay and then we got okay what's
here
one there's our telep photo okay 120 you
zoom in 120 times from your puny three
times opticle zoom camera that is that
okay let's see what we have
here here is our oh they won't even show
it I wouldn't show 120 times it's from a
three times opstal zoom camera I mean
that's Lally like me zooming in
120 times from an s20 ultra which you
kind of could do but I me that was four
years ago I mean come on show some a SP
for a five time zoom cam on here maybe a
10 okay um Master
mode okay this hosle coroporation is
thing is weird Okay
um
HDR
DSLR
okay it can charge
to oh finishes charging in 30 minutes I
mean that's great that's almost better
than removable battery removable battery
here we were listening through the event
you know the episode where my Rell traps
Emily and uh uh Matthew in the uh escape
room right and suzu's phone and this
episode was uh released in 2019 uh they
the way they get out is they use su's
phone as a
uh weed switch to unlock the door and
they also make a weed switch from the
inside with some chemicals and stuff
right well I mean it is 2019 what roval
battery phonus you having to no no
granted suzu is from Japan so maybe they
have like different uh technology there
than they do in United States but
um it honestly doesn't make sense that
uh she has a remov b film it's not like
kids are like running around you know um
using Galaxy X covers it's kind of weird
I mean Evin Odyssey has always been at
the Forefront of technology I mean in
the 80s they had people like War dialing
uh into wit in to like hack into the
modem and then they also had um people
they had a voice text AI thing called
computer program called Maple okay this
is in 1989 in real time that Odyssey
Time Odyssey time is kind of weird Okay
in 2000 they had like this virus
implanted on the Imagination Station
which is a 3D you know you know you know
Imagination Station 3D like virtual
reality
machine I actually invented this thing
called Imagination Station Theory I
think it's over on the Odyssey boy.
blogspot.com where it's since it's the
80s kids can see like these like Roblox
like characters being rented from a
super computer
um and think oh wow like these Blacky it
looks so real but then it gets
progressively b anyway
um yeah and then they also have the
imagination St and the 3D virtual
reality thing like the teken Odyssey is
kind of weird all right in like 2019
2020 19 there's this episode where they
uh where they track some of the
imagination station except it's fake
it's virtual like there no walls or
anything so it's like virtual reality
inside of
uh inside of uh
thing okay let's see what our article is
about Imagination Station
the
okay let's
[Music]
see oh man I remember these days when we
were waiting for rideal episodes and oh
you can't even see I remember these days
when we waiting for Rell episodes in
like 2020 I was like oh man I can't wait
I can't wait now they're coming out we
got event Odyssey
2012
[Music]
um episode 1000 is coming out oh man
2022 was a great year for me uh in terms
of Odyssey so this the tech of
odyssey
yeah so like it's kind of weird like if
rs's always been tech for positive like
super fance and I have this kid just
like know running around with a
removable battery phone in like 2019
okay like maybe in 2002 you this ultra
high high definition 5G Nova box style
phone right and let's get to our did I
