<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 51824 Its Coming!!!</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
this weekend the tech boy
podcast um yeah so lots have happened in
the tech world this week Apple um at
Lisa IP ads last week and we got to get
to the controversial advertising once
again I had a brand new idea for a
mobile application and Mr the boss
released it uh his longest ever video
about minimalist technology and as you
guys know I probably despise minimalist
technology and there are so minutes in
the video that we're going to react to
that you guys are going to see how much
I despise the technology and also um s24
Ultra could be coming soon um hopefully
I will get to test it in the coming
weeks and have a full review out for you
in uh
online and on YouTube but let us get
to the um oh Google IO and chat GPT 40
how could I forgotten and we already
have our first comment hello Thor pan 11
chat and Google Gemini uh also got big
upgrades this
week and you know what that means
guys uh the end of the world is my just
kidding it's not chat GPT and Google G
of course not the Antichrist or any of
those weird dinkies there and it's also
very useful for education I haven't got
my hand on it yet I've been able to chat
to GPT 40 but I haven't been able to uh
process live video feed red as I do not
PID a $20 month subscription um I was
able to chat image in was was able to
correctly identify a famous person from
an image with some text with this name
in it and hello Kate welcome to the
show so Google IO I guess we can start
with that so let's start with Google IO
um summary
fun fact I actually got to go hand on
with the Google pixel phones just for a
little bit and the Google pixel tablet
on Thursday at my local Best Buy
location so there's 100 things that
Google announced at Google
IO and I also want to show you this tool
from Google it's called Google
I really wish this with an offline AI
tool but it's not but it's very useful
um Google
notebook yes there it is notebook lm.
gooogle do something anyway this tool
allows you to upload documents Google
Documents um and just text text based
documents and you can upload stuff so
like say the United States Constitution
the build of Rights um all the
Amendments that we have in there and you
can ask it questions and then it will
use only based off those documents not
based on web data um how um it will
answer questions based on that so um say
I uploaded States Constitution to Google
playground uh notebook. LM um it would
ask me and I can say hey what is the
Second Amendment it would tell me what
the Second Amendment is and tell me what
it's about
um and as you can see this would be a
very vital tool um for business um let's
say you are the Secretary of your
business right and you have all the
meeting notes from 100 um 100 meetings
right you can upload them into Google
notebook LM and ask questions about
every meeting that you've taken notes on
as you can see here you can upload your
files or just copy and paste your text
and it will you know search through here
um of course this will probably be used
by people
to you know like cheat on stuff but I
can potentially see the greatness of
this in fact I have uploaded some of my
own Internal Documentation over on our
new for our new website and to ask about
uh to ask it details about it and it has
done a really good job um and so that's
one of the AI tools I want to show off
to you actually it's been around for a
year but I just found out about it this
um this week all right now here we are
to Google IO so they introduced Gemini
1.5 flash that is a fast Gemini model
and then they upgraded and updated the
1.5 Pro and Flash and added more token
context to the Google Studio which means
that oh yeah um I guess if you didn't
hear we launched it last week I will put
it down here s a l t
w oh sorry wrong link let me take that
down
here is the official
link all right anyway um so they've
updated the Gemini models to include
more tokens tokens would be that um
things that it can process so if it can
hold more tokens you can ask it more
things um and will remember more things
in context I think of it as RAM for AI I
guess so it can hold more things in its
memory so 1.5 Pro is now available of
two million token context window um so
this is a comparison of what it can
do so uh gp4 turbo so this is probably
what most people using uh 1,00 sorry
1,28 uh tokens compared to gini 1.5 to1
million tokens which according to Google
is 1.4 million words 60,000 lines of
codes or two hours of video processing
right for instance two hours of video
processing would be about the length of
this podcast episode okay and then
they've added some more AI stuff and uh
some generative uh media and Labs
experiments uh we still have to check to
see if they turned on people generation
technology if they brought it back to
Gemini as you guys know back in February
they had the controversy of um uh racism
within the chat Bots or something like
that
um and now they have video generation uh
models yet of course to the people with
the oh no video generation is so scary
right the thing is that most video isn't
shot at 4K 60 frames per second
cinematic um everything like this so
it's probably just going to be used more
towards the higher end of things and
it's going to be really hard to get to
the lower end of things for like real
cell phone video right so if I were to
say import clips of people
um nice let's say I was to import clips
of like people I have on my phone and
took them into an AI video editor and
say hey make this into like some type of
fight even if that's possible which
would take a lot of work um and they all
like started fighting each other first
of all the clips would be way too high
quality that if I tried to turn them
into any authorities not one person
would believe it because um if you've
ever seen a high school fight scene uh
like in a locker room or something uh
it's not taken with the best quality uh
camera um it's taken like some some
random kids iPhone import mode um and
second of all it's going to be easily
falsifiable because uh it's not just
taken by one kid it's taken by
like 50 kids right it's like CNN Fox
News MSNBC are all in there taking
pictures in videos of a literal fight
like it's basically its own little press
conference thing and they have Flash and
you have to get all the reflections
right and the people are moving and the
camera is janky and everything like that
that's how you know it's you know
authentic right you can't come in here
with super stabilized 60 frame second
video and even you said hey maybe it's
from like a security camera it happened
like in the what they called hallways or
something that still doesn't make sense
because uh security cameras are not you
know 40 4K 60 frames per second you know
zooming in on people's faces and stuff
like that it's like a high school uh not
a know high
tech prison um anyway so that's video
generation that's my stance on that and
then music AI
sandbox that's interesting I've used
some my own free AI music generators I
tried to had had co-pilot song generator
uh like write a song based on the
national anthem of the United States of
America for computers and I placed it
into a song generator it did not sound
well the music was awful and their
voices were trash so hopefully Google is
better
um video FX let you turn an idea into a
video clip that's interesting um
hopefully they
can videotaping Point fights and posted
them so glad I graduated when I did um
yeah I mean I would Pro potentially like
videotape fights and then like turn them
into the authorities uh had you know I
known about any fights that went on at
that's what I would do um but that's
just one another example of course you
can think of your own other example kids
being placed into situations that they
shouldn't be uh placed into or shouldn't
be into that can make them look bad uh
say like a boyfriend or girlfriend and
some other random kid uh who doesn't
like this couple tries to break them up
by having one of them like cheat on them
by hugging another person in an image or
something like that I mean sure I guess
it's technically feasible but it would
take a lot of work and be the image
quality would probably be a bit too good
though I guess you could argue hey I got
an iPhone 15 Pro uh s24 Ultra look my
camera quality is good and yes the
camera qualities of those phones are
good it's just not GNA have you know
perfect bouquet that the uh phones have
and speaking of Samsung and AI um my
Samsung Galaxy s22 Plus finally got the
oneui 6.1 update and with the the
generative AI features on the device and
I am excited these features are are
genuinely good um so we'll get into that
after we get through this Google IO
article so this is going to be an field
episode I can already tell um let's
see upload to Google Drive Gemini and
Google messages that might be
interesting um I switched back to
Samsung messages I couldn't span Google
messages um and I really wish that they
uh Google would bring RCS to a wide
variety of messaging applications
because one of the major standpoints of
um Android devices uh one one of the
benefits is that you can change your
messaging applications um on I mean
technically on Apple you could change it
but you can't change the default right
so iMessage is the only app that you can
use to send smss on an iPhone um and
with Google messages it's now the only
app you can send use to send rcs's
well technically beo mini uh not be mini
beo just regular beoo can send rcs's um
messages because you can sign in with
your Google account and will sync with
Google messages so I'm hoping that maybe
Google will open up the API to other
messaging applications unless you send
RCS messages um though I would be
nervous about having all my phone
messages in in the cloud and stuff
seeing as um there have been multiple
hacks over the years notably I think in
2005 there's this phone called the
T-Mobile Sidekick and some celebrity
that got got hacked D through through
the phone and this is way back in 2005
and it was a smartphone but you know
everything was up in the danger hiop
that's the other name of the phone it's
actually a pretty good interesting phone
it still in my opinion to this day has a
keyboard had internet messaging
uh it's basically like a Blackberry for
teenagers um I can actually pull it up
from
here anyway this celebrities uh phone
and pictures got hacked um through
through the cloud and everything was
here Shifty I says I remember the side
kicks so here's the image here so this
is what a T-Mobile Sidekick looks like
basically anyway so the celebrity phone
got hacked through the cloud and um
everything got leaked because everything
was backed up into the cloud and then
back in 2014 uh like a whole bunch of
celebrities got their photos hacked and
maybe even a messages I'm not sure uh I
think it's just photos though and leaks
um due to an iCloud vulnerability I'm
not anti cloud storage I'm all forward
like my school uses of course Cloud
accounts and stuff up to Cloud but I
just wouldn't be comfortable with having
it just with one Google login because
those can be easily fished and um you
can also be signed in onto a computer
which is probably not as secure as a
phone because you have you know all
these ports on here and all the other
connectivity options right um and of
course if your messages get hacked Then
There Goes you tofa and stuff like that
I know stuff like Sim swapping exists
but that that means you have to do like
actual hacking that you can get
prosecuted for like walking past
someone's computer and unlocking
password like or like walking past
someone's computer and just like going
to google. messages and checking reading
that that you could probably get away
with that not condoning it but I'm
saying you could probably get away with
that so yeah um but I wish there was
more um Choice within the Google
ecosystem for messaging applications
like right now the Samsung messages
which of course it's only on Samsung and
then Google messages is everywhere and
it's the only one that officially
supports RCS and then these other
appliations but they all have ads in
them including simple mobile
applications which I once
um promoted because the DI application
allows you to pin it um and still make a
call so that's useful for let's say you
want to give your phone to someone so
that they can make a call but you don't
want them you know searching through
your phone um Samsung has this feature
called pin apps on the screen and it
locks you to that one specific app kind
of like a kiosk now I tried to on the
regular Dial Samsung app that comes
built into the phone and that didn't
work you could dial the number but then
the call wouldn't go through but on
SIMPLE Mobile dialer um it's from this
company called Simple mobile
applications uh it would let you go
through and it still does let you go
through but now it has ads which I mean
getting ads in the middle of your
dialing application that's just like
wrong especially if they're full screen
ads I mean if they're like bottom bottom
ads and you just don't really have to
see them anything but if they're full
screen ads and you have to click X and
stuff like that especially if my phone
with like 15% of the screen it's broken
um that could be like a security
vulnerability uh like turn to call 911
and you gota wait wait I gotta get rid
of this Tik Tok ad or whatever so yeah
that's annoying um yeah so Shifty I
Shady what do you remember about the
T-Mobile uh Sidekicks and as uh Shifty I
Shady um we his time of the T-Mobile
Sidekicks when I'm going to talk about
the Galaxy AI features that are present
in this device and this face ba uh face
not face Bas that's from fsy face ranker
application and photo manipulator um
application that I really
like all right so my s22 plus got all of
the goog Galaxy AI features so I
switched back to Samsung internet from
Edge um so I can get the summarizer and
it did a good job summarizing it seems
that for more established sources like
things like I had it summarized the
constitution on archive. goov or
something it seems that it knows what
the Constitution already is but on sites
that are as established like say my own
personal website it also can summarize
stuff like that um and then for the uh
photo editing stuff it is a little bit
restrictive I tried to do like some face
swapping uh like moving and something
around
uh but that didn't really work but I can
like move stuff up and down across the
images um so I have this image here um
this is the original image that came out
of like Microsoft co-pilot and
now I have
a and now I have this new
image here with just some minor editing
all inside the Galaxy app so I was able
to move the pole over and delete this
stupid thing that was right there so
yeah the editing is really good on here
actually I'll do a
demonstration like even this image yeah
I I and of course you're able to uh
remove
the water mark that it puts on here even
this image here which is obviously AI
generated but you can't even tell that
it was modified regenerative edit I
actually just flipped it around and then
moved his laptop with dring part of the
image into his hand so that was pretty
good that's fun I wanted to go to the
Tom um sometime uh um of course that's
com with some metadata that says uh made
with generative edit but that is okay
now of course generative edit is
unfortunately online and I hopeing can
set for more powerful phones um at least
in the future like say the s25 ultra uh
especially since you know all these
chips nowadays are going to be made um
using AI technology that um not made
using AI technology but have ai
technology localizes built and that
these basic minor edits not expanding
gener fi which I really like the F
aspect of this and you can add in new
images to stuff which is good you could
have done that you know previously um
using the sticker function on Samsung
devices but that is fine um because it
adds in extra info to it it's really fun
to edit images I really like it a lot I
just don't like that it's connect to the
web um for the notes feature it's really
good it summarizes um summarizes stuff
and it generates the covers really well
um and it's all offline and for the
recording feature this is a really
useful feature for me it transcribes Fe
the stuff all online so that's going to
be a really important speed test when I
compar this phone to s24 ultra on who
can transcribe audio the fastest
natively built in to of a quarter so I
would like that going Toe to Toe with
Google which obviously I played the
transcribe function yes two days ago at
Best
Buy um and then a circle to search which
is not I don't even know why it's an AI
feature um it works well but Google
assistant already had this thing called
search uh
search the screen and then you could
just like kind of so it's not even AI
feature unfortunately that means Google
Assistant got moved away from the home
button to the sides of the screen and
you have to swipe in but it's really
easy uh I switched back from Gemini to
resistant it's really little easy to um
summon the Google assistant and I heard
that the three button gestures like
hyper gestures where you would swipe up
and it would go back swipe up and go
home and swipe up which is obviously a
lot better than the stupid iPhone and
pixel just that they make you use um got
removed but thankfully um on one 6.1
update but thankfully good luck
apparently has you covered so I am
thankful about that okay so my favorite
AI feature maybe oh oh almost forgot
chat assist and chat chat Translate
translation features they look like
they're working well they're working
fast they downloaded Spanish and Chinese
um download Spanish and Chinese I'm not
of course fluent in those languages they
look like they they're working well in
mode chat assist um chat assist does not
work in certain chatting applications
that of course like the secure ones that
don't let you take Snapchat uh
screenshots like Snapchat uh unless of
course you use Google search to take
your Snapchat screenshot which uh was a
headline we had this
um this week I think it was our Monday
article so um if you guys want
to screenshot chat and Snapchat um here
you go Circle the search so all you have
to do is circle the search and then
it'll pull up this thing here and then
you can screenshot
that um so yeah that's that's basically
it
and oh can you even see oh you didn't
even see it on the screen so yeah so you
just have to go in here and it will pull
up this kind of screen here so you
Circle the search boom
screenshot um so yep that's a security
ability right there that I am thankful
that exists all right um and then of
course chat but unfortunately that means
chat translate and stuff like that does
not work in uh apps like that but it
does work
in you can still chat into English and
will translate into Spanish it looks
like good Spanish it has all
the like the fils and the question marks
are correct so that seems like it's
working well and it does work on Samsung
default messaging application I still
need to test it I don't know if it's
accurate or anything like that and of
course the phone of course I haven't
tested that either like the phone
calling stuff all right
um what
else so my oh oh oh the
chat uh writing style and spelling
grammar I really like the spelling
grammar thing it gets it like 95% of
time add periods and comments and
puncturation and all of that good stuff
um changes my words for me int
intelligible English and then writing
style makes you look you know fancy
unfortunately writing style seems to
have some type of weird sensor on it so
even I'm not talking about uh what is
what I'm talking about the Galaxy AI
features on uh that came to my device
chat TPT uh it's kind of based on
it so the feature right now I'm talking
about if you can type something in let's
say you're sending a text and with
writing style you can change um the
style of writing so let's say I have um
um let's say I have the sentence um do
you like
Samsung right so spreading a grammo will
change it to something it will add the
punctuation it will make all the woods
correct in Sp um spell it and in writing
style it will fluff up your words and
you can have a professional um thing
that says may I inquire you about your
preference for Samsung products question
mark and then there'll be like social it
says do you like Samsung question mark
someon and then some hashtags so I I
actually kind of like this feature
because I obviously cannot speak in
social media language I usually speak in
like you know actual language um so I
like that it adds the hashtags and the
um things like that so I this is my
number one most use Samsung feature
because it's good for sending off stuff
actually edited some blog poting it can
really handle like pages and Pages not
Pages like maybe two three pages of work
like the Snapchat stuff like that and
it's still like my work so um of course
uh last we ran an article saying that we
used chat GPT to edit um some of the
things on the post on our website um so
this is basically having at the tip of
my fingertips which makes this like more
useful for typing than say my computer
which right now just not have that but
may have c-i integration but my
computer's kind of so up so I'm not
hoping on that well I mean I am hoping
on that I'm just not hoping on using
that and then of course my I guess my
second favorite after that would be of
course the image stuff because I you can
do so much stuff with that um it's
really good for uh detective and
Espionage might even get moved into the
ssw um blog spot but um I guess while
we're on the topic of chatting right now
I guess I wanted to address something
here that I see in society um so it
seems that lots of people uh at least
teenagers in particular use in uh social
media applications like Instagram snap
just not really that much for social
media application you count those stupid
videos that are on there that like all
out of date like they were all tapes
last year um anyway
um yeah so they're using these other
applications but not necessarily have to
be social media but just non- texting
applications telegram slack this just
from my own phone telegram slack
WhatApp
um etc etc etc um you get what I mean uh
Google meet like it seems like people
are afraid of texting or something like
that or like handing out their number
right but the problem with that is all
these applications will are under web
and until people came along you don't
really have a unified messaging solution
it's not truly unified that's you know
every messaging application which is
kind of weird that I think that people
using like Facebook which is a site that
you use to post news articles and and
images to like chat with their friends
and Instagram which is
like that doesn't really make sense that
people are actually using that as their
primary message method communication
using like phone number phones uh SMS
which nowadays like maybe like back in
2011 when people actually charge 25
cents per text uh that Mak sense but now
any decent phone plan um has obviously
free texts um and you don't even need
data to connect to that on Wi-Fi um so I
was thinking about this application here
and I guess one of the reasons people
have a vers into this is well a it's
easy to find people on sites like
Instagram you can just type in their
name and if it's not common or if you
know who they are and just get a QR code
and stuff like that right um it's easier
to find people on there and I guess
maybe they're scared that they'll get
like tracked or send spam text their
phones or something like that um which I
I don't know um so I was thinking about
this site here that wouldn't be a social
media website it is be a site you can
upload three pictures a month um this is
basically be so let people know it's you
maybe have to do some ID verifications
just so that they know it's you um and
you put your phone number in the site
and you can chat to people on the site
and it works over Wi-Fi and data right
and you chat to people on it um kind of
like email I guess kind of like a
instant messaging application right but
it also has SMS fallback so that you can
still use this um you can still use this
uh application even when there's no
Wi-Fi or data so it would be good for
like emergencies or whatever so has SMS
fallback but it doesn't reveal the phone
number it they just have like their
unique handle and ID and then the
servers you know send it to them
yourself what what do you guys think
about that that was an idea that I had
and you can upload like three pictures a
month maybe like I guess you can upload
stories or whatever um so like a chat
app SMS fallback and it's just an easy
way you get everyone to use it you can
import your contacts from Instagram or
SnapChat or whatever and so it's
basically like the reverse of Snapchat
apparently on Snapchat you can search
for friends by their phone number um
this you be searching for phone numbers
by their friends except you won't get
their phone number you'll get their
handles
um and I yeah so I think that would be a
really good idea oh oh almost forgot I
got the Samsung
SSD wait is
it oh well it's not here right now but
it's the Samsung t7
um SSD and apparently it works on
Windows I only tested it on my Samsung
phone uh it's USBC and it does not work
with the app that it tells you to
download in the back the Samsung
portable SSD application um so this app
here is broken it's not even allowed in
the Play Store oh it's not even working
on my newest version of Android now so
if you guys want to be able to use this
SSD which I like a lot two terabytes of
storage fingerprints it only supports 16
digigit uh password which is kind of sad
because obviously it's a two terab SSD I
mean you can back up your phone your
computer anything on here so I really
don't have like strong encryption but it
does have fingerprint support I want to
see how good it is resisting attacks um
from other fingers that I have have um
on me not and then like from other
people and of course you know if someone
would get a piece of tape it almost go
because obviously if it can get hacked
by like a 5-year-old in aent crafts
class then it's not good for security
anyway so this new application
um where is
it uh the application that you have to
use and that we with my phone is called
Samsung magician okay it has 2.7 stores
on the Play store but it works with my
Samsung Port SSD so check that out and
you might see a review next week of um
the SSD but for right now I'm liking it
a lot the Samsung magician gives me
internal specs about it tells me that
there's like uh the storage capacity and
the temperature in celsius told me it
was at 30 degrees Celsius which is kind
of hot but it said it was good so
uh 30 Celsius what's that yeah 86 86 86
is good okay okay 30 Celsius not that
bad that's right 86 degrees Fahrenheit
for those of us in United States of
America using Freedom Units all right
um now speaking of countries that use
um non Freedom Units the metric system
let's go to Mr who's the Boss
for his review of minimalist technology
it's a 50 minute video and we're
obviously AR going to watch the entire
thing um we don't want to get copyright
stuck of course but um we just going to
go to the most important Tech products
here and then of course we got to react
to people getting really mad about the
Apple commercial including Samsung who
um responded back to it and of course as
a Samsung fan it is my job to defend
them in any case oh oh oh and then of
course we got to talk about the chat GPT
announcement so guys don't go away here
we go I bought the most minimist tech
ever starting
now all right here we
go what if you could do SEO smarter and
faster with Wix you can edit your meta
tag I about spend all right so we don't
really need to see oh it's not 50
minutes actually 48 minutes 10 seconds
so he's just going through and buying
here I have lots to say about this phone
um all right here we go you brought this
record player I actually like this thing
a lot um at least the physics behind it
ever to film this in very exciting come
let me show you so let's go roughly from
least expensive to most expensive he
does deviate from that a little bit so
you know need to a fying plate it's bad
um like this a tech Channel um okay it
says stupid all right let's talk about
this thank
you B that's pretty cool engineering so
it is a gaming console that costs about
$95 um and it's uh has its
own game so it's not an emulation thing
or anything like that it has its own
games two of them drop per week or
something like that for 12
weeks which is obviously a way to get
you to keep using the device because if
they came
24
um if they came with 24 games pre-loaded
right they're black and white
eink
games you you'd be done with the thing
and of course they probably would run
out of money I don't because you
probably wouldn't want to download any
more games which cost I first saw this
thing I thought this is how you charge
up the device that would be tell
actually very oh wait I don't know if
it's ink but it's black and white that's
sorry glad that's not the case that
would be nightmare this is actually one
of your controls to be able to play
games with I will say it is a very
pretty piece of tech surprisingly so the
buttons feel really satisfying the
screen is only black and white it gets
noticeably more readable as I tilt it up
towards the light but that's interesting
I don't know why do we go with the black
and white aesthetic of course this is
minimalist which the entire minimalist
thing is
like less for more money which is
extremely annoying like I've said this
multiple times
anyway the most important question on my
mind is is it fun okay so the UI is
definitely much more responsive than you
expect it to be based on I mean that's
good but it's kind of like the um what's
that thing called the rabbit or the
little sore wheel I mean yeah sure it
might be fun but like do you want to
have to scroll through your game
catalog using a Jack and thebox
controller how the thing looks does feel
like it's running at a full 60 frames
per second yeah it's got really smooth
animations but really retro Graphics
it's got this weird which is interesting
because uh I I I know where your games
look like um some of those they were in
color as Julian marshel um said as
Connie Kindle what was life like before
um you were in color no that's not how
it works there was there was color in
the 80s past meets future vibe to it I
don't know how I feel about this crank
to be honest like I totally respect the
need to be different but it's just
making my hands ache and I can't imagine
this he says it's so scarly like uh EV
AR just put out this uh episode about
Eric little the r and he says it exactly
the way he say maybe it's a try as a
voice acting being the way that I want
to play games on like a long airplane
flight for example let's try casual bder
oh this is really weird it turns your
device into a camera and then you use
the crank to focus that camera I'm
unfocused
and then I'm Focus one thing this unique
control scheme means is that you're
definitely not playing games you've ever
played before this isn't I mean that's
true but are they good games I don't
know like I'm not a gamer but like a
retro emulation device but I just I
don't think it's for me so there's only
two games on here right now but the way
this works which is actually quite cool
to be fair is they stagger them so they
give you two games yes it is you receive
two games games for 24 weeks that's 24
free
games every week for the first 12 weeks
of owning it and that's all included
with the price I guess they stagger it
to let you appreciate each game before
giving you no it's because if they
release a device with only 24
games at initial launch they'd still
they they'd lose
money
like that's like selling a phone with
only two apps oh wait wait a second
those stupid gab phones do that but even
gab has more ABS than that when I'm
comparing you the Gap that's a bad thing
okay those Gap phones H yeah know you
you guys already know uh from October
7th my view uh the October 7th episode
my views on those provincial control
applications gab phone is basically like
a parental control application built
into phone of course the newer ones are
more secure but they'll be hacked soon
and the old ones are be hackable and
piece of junk apparently they use the
Samsung nox manager to prevent apks from
getting installed
um so yeah fun times the next one but
it's just playing on something like this
really makes me realize that me
personally I actually don't want
minimalism in my games I want more
buttons I want more power yes it's the
point of games like if I wanted
minimalism in games I go throw a paper
airplane and I play tic tac toe video
games are the opposite of
minimalism um it
like video games have
progressed upward terms of Graphics
processing power
right and I guess people have become so
bored now that taking features away is
now a feature now I'm not talking about
taking stuff away like headphone jack
home button to replace it with something
else uh well headphone jack like taking
away the home button replace it with the
bigger screen uh taking away the
headphone jack allegedly added a bigger
battery um etc
etc
but taking
away Ram or a color screen like even
this
Nokia uh 3310 3G from 2017
that is a minimalist phone had a color
screen and a camera um or has a color
screen and a camera taking away features
for the sake of minimalism and then
charging people extra money because no
one wants you to buy your stuff which
means you have to you know make add more
money to it add a higher price to it so
that at least two in a profit especially
since
like I don't even know if they make
black and white screens because most
same people want color
screens or they make them but of course
just not going to be as much a demand or
failing that just multiplayer and I
think for more people i' actually like
to see how multiplayer works on that
like what one person turns the crank and
one person pushes the button something
like the Miu Mini Plus has much more
appeal so this is something of course
that it P is probably illegal because
apparently has like thousands of games
and its catalog and retro emulation uh
capabilities but you know emulation you
you can't download the RS online without
you know breaking copyright law or
piracy laws and you make the vs yourself
um from the game that you legally
bought anyway here's our next product
the Light phone which piece of John
you're going to be the handsomest
wedding
guest oh that look
amazing was saying is that doing it this
way would cause the essential phone is a
big so here we have the $300 Light phone
that's why I said $300 for this
$300 and
okay I mean this this is basically
almost a scam okay this is a step up in
between the no phone which is basically
a piece of plastic or an empty bag that
you can pay $17 for and uh a
smartwatch okay first of all let's look
at the screen here it is black and
white it technically runs Android
because these people of course couldn't
afford to make their own trash OS so
they decided to take a good OS and make
it trash what can this do it can text
okay oh I respect that they didn't use
T9 typing but of course they make you
have to text in landscape mode but this
phone is so small that it's almost as
wide as it is long and the bezels are as
big as the screen now they're doing a
good job to use it but there's something
much easier don't buy it you cannot use
what you don't
own and in spending $300 for you to not
use something is such a terrible
business model I mean it's working for
them so congratulations but it's a
terrible business model in the end like
any upgrade that they make to the phones
will make their core audience disappear
and second of all people probably
goingon to upgrade these phones because
gonna forget about them and no one's
gonna have this sense of brand loyalty
to this company because it's a piece of
junk it on purpose it's not a piece of
junk because it's a $50 uh Android phone
from 2017 off of Amazon which ironically
could do more than this phone it's a
piece of junk because they designed it
to be a piece of junk it's a piece of
designer junk and it's $300 of designer
junk for $300 you can get something like
the B30 Pro 5G from new which has
infinitely more cameras than this phone
uh four uh four times big a screen etc
etc and more times processing power and
you can say oh well you know I don't
want to use my phone as much okay fine
either download one of those minimalist
apps which I despise is but don't
despise as much as a $300 phone because
those minimalist apps which cost money
because they don't take that I don't
want to show ad or
whatever for like say a dollar um let's
say $1.99 a month right that is $2 mon
$24 a year um
um so you can use the app for 12 and a
half years and you would have paid the
price of a light Sone
congratulations you have to type
sideways I guess they've decided that
that's the only way you can comfortably
type on a screen like this and it's not
too bad it's a little bit less
responsive than you probably used to and
the autocorrect kind of sucks it connect
as a Wi-Fi hotspot it's got which is
good basically it's replicating the uh
features in functionality that was on a
cell phone wish list from 2007 uh
because people would take their phones
and hotspot them together to
um a laptop but I've seen feature phones
that have more features than this
example the T-Mobile hiptop from 2005
the Nokia 3310 from
2017 and n95 from 2006 I guess that's a
smartphone um oh yes my great
Grandmother's kyos phone has more
features than this phone and it's a flip
phone got Bluetooth it's got a headphone
jack on the top so it's got your music
covered it does say it has directions
what does that even look like on a phone
like wait it's using Google Maps in an
in display uh no color God this is so
clunky you have to keep rotating every
single time it's pretty
slow by the way it's acting you'd think
I just asked it to Sol physics not ask
for walking directions oh but it does
give you some semblance of Google Maps I
assume it is I mean look at that lag
that is
awful and if you're trying to drive or
something I mean turn right it's
probably not going to even turn right
until you're like 50 m past it not a
good way to use it though Cy cuz this is
an eink screen so it doesn't have smooth
animations it has to render every single
thing on screen every time I mean I
guess the battery life is good but of
course the say you try to down a number
swipe up unlock open the phone app type
in your 10 numbers say
713 Boom the call goes
through it changes but this will be fun
let's see what the call Quality is like
oh yeah here's another problem I was
just about to call my mom but she's in
India right now so I would have normally
WhatsApp called her there is no WhatsApp
here no technically you could get any
Android application on here that you
want because it's running Android you
can just drag the APK file ser and we
know it can connect to internet because
it has Maps it has you don't need
previous experience or a degree the
Google data analytics certificate will
teach you to and it has the hotspotting
capabilities which is why Windows phones
like say B and uh those stupid like
control enabled uh phones like not not
even just app it's like the the phones
basically the brand itself like Gap
phone bark phone Etc this phone does not
have internet and then they turn around
and say this phone features 24/7 GPS
tracking um excuse me for asking but how
on Earth are you going to get the uh the
GPS location of your kid's phone um from
a website without the phone being able
to access the internet uh I doubt that
you have your own little communication
Network that you all set up just for
this because obviously they're losing
money on these phones I'm not losing
money but they're not making that much
money because they are trash they buy
trash phones and then they make them
even trashier like the Galaxy 813 I mean
it's decent phone but then they put the
trash software on it that doesn't let
you do anything which is the entire
selling point the phone and then they
upsell it to parents for $300 instead of
the
trash 119 that you get off of eBay for
so yeah
good oh hi Domino I wonder how many
normal people have spoken to like him
oops we're big fans could we get some
pepper big fan of Domino
Pizza okay it's function the speaker for
un quality sounded kind of quiet to me
though it could just be my audio is down
for calls it does have a speaker phone
it's not I'm I'm glad that it has a
speaker phone you know for $200 I've
expected to also have a a drone in the
Box all it can't do particularly loud
now we got some pizzas on the way I'm
slightly torn with devices like this
because I see the appeal you know a
phone all right all right all right fine
the appeal whatever but
anyway so here you go here here's the
Light phone
2
which maybe someone's like just been
sitting around waiting for this so it
has 4G
connectivity um it has the same table
design like the bezels are genuinely
bigger than the
screen
um I don't even see a list of features
here okay okay here we go list of
features calls messages and group
texting which I'm so glad that this
takes group testt texting again they
stole their feature list from 2007 and
the phone from 2007 wins and I'm not
talking about the iPhone I'm talking
about a flip phone okay if your phone
loses to an LG Chocolate from 2007 which
is like the first capacitive touchcreen
phone uh you shouldn't be selling it all
right so you there's a customizable
toolbox menu for the phone where you can
add remove additional features including
an alarm yes yes an alarm is not even
pre-installed people an
alarm we can't have people running
around with alarms that that that just
be terrible for society uh timer a
calculator simple music player podcast
tool notes tool which taking notes on
that thing must
be terrible a calendar and directions
which they could do so many more I mean
come on a voice recorder would be nice
uh there's no camera
so uh Spotify maybe I'm not sure they
could sport it especially they're trying
to play stuff in the background um this
basically going back to the Microsoft
DOS days of 20 of not 2000 1980 where
you can only RN one app in the
background uh one app at a time a
calendar which I if it's a web- based
calendar do you even want to look at
that thing um features it will never
have we will never have social media
$200 and you can't even have social
media internet browsing email news or
ads well okay there are no infinite
feeds or tools are
intentional only English
language which yeah because the people
who uh on third world countries don't
even like this phone that weighs nothing
it could disappear within your pockets
plus it does seem to be getting quite a
few software updates from what I can see
ah yes software updates you see when you
start your phone with nothing you can
easily roll out software updates when
you're just stealing a features list
from 2007 like software updates now like
smartphones they're a big deal because
they bring change to
stuff but software updates
for that I mean adding a calculator
would be a press conference news with of
the events they'll send out a press
release could you imagine if Samsung you
know like well the only company that
could actually compare it be apple we
added a calculator to a 3,000 iPad th000
iPad
uh so here's a price release they
probably have an entire WWDC event about
it it's just but only Apple could do
that could you imagine if Samsung or LG
or boou or any new came out like hey
guys we have the calculator app we're so
proud people be looking at you like
crazy most people I don't think it does
quite enough to replace your smartphone
like you can't browse the internet which
it costs $200 for you should not browse
internet like I mean if you don't want
to browse the internet get a flip phone
from
kyos at Walmart for $30 the music you
don't need to spend
uh $300 for a soap brick all right here
we go there's some
tea a purifying table from LG that's
quiet oh here we go here's a a Samsung
speaker frame which uh not good the
Wireless company with nothing to hide
seriously hidden fees we don't have
expecting where's the record
player record
player well we got to talk about that TV
of course U I'll just SE do the
transcript so go into here wow trending
48 of course Mo to like And subscribe to
my channel as
well and it's TR is loading so I guess
we can watch
this uh
oh
uhoh it's also a little disappointing
that this is literally just paper you
know when I first saw it on the website
I thought oh maybe it's a screen that
will allow you to put anything on it or
at the very least like a backlight so
that it brightens up your image it means
that really there is no Tech here apart
from the speaker right let's find
so
$33,700 that's said $3,700
so perspective that is a spec out iPad
M4 Pro with the keyboard the
pencil and then an iPad
a um to put that in
perspective pretty see you can get a
used car for
that and then to put that in perspective
again
that is only
12.3 light phones which is I'm saying
something about Society all right and
it's a record player here we go $100 is
how much we spent on the black it's
handmade but I don't care if it's made
by the
president it does not need to be $3,700
and I know the rational part of my brain
keeps telling me records make no sense
in today's age I'm already paying
Spotify and tidal for my music digitally
this saying hey guys look uh see records
give me a nice physical warm Rich blah
blah blah blah blah whatever I don't
care what I do care about is you can get
a record player from the Marshall's
checkout line for $200 at least around
Christmas time and you know what those
have built-in Bluetooth player connects
to the same speakers that my phone
already connects to and there must be
software by now that can make my phone
recreate the sound signature of record
Cs and it be cheaper to make your own
software that than it would be to
literally buy this thing which I mean to
be fa does look nice it's a nice piece
I'm pretty sure you can find something
that looks like that on wish.com for $50
just like with the tea and the coffee
there is something just so alluring
about the manual process of slipping out
the vinyl of gently sort of placing it
on top and then clasping this magnet in
place and then do you want to know how
to turn it on I guess that's good is it
worth
$3,700 no
no no you just Spin and you will
actually see oh my goodness me look at
the arm it slowly comes out this is one
of the smoothest operating pieces of
technology I think I I expect it to be
smooth and nice and sleek and I also
expect that thing to be able to spin the
record fast enough that it gets up and
flies I want it to double as the ring
home security drone for $3,700 evered
with you can see it edging towards the
first track there you go oh so this
right here is the volume dial that feels
so satisfying and I love the way it
displays itself using these tiny little
LEDs wait but also this record player
very clearly understands the tracks
within the vinyl I've just placed on it
and it's allowing me to navigate to the
exact points in those tracks that I want
use f feature because most record
players don't do this so now your Rec
player became a gigantic CD
player for 2007 allow you could have
done better putting my vinyl player at
home to shame and the way they've done
this again I hope it does that too it's
$3,700 that cost more than my TV in most
people's TVs the interface is so subtle
but clever because there's no screen
here so all of your information is
coming from tiny little LEDs that are
lit up to different levels of brightness
and you yes yes yes $2700 you get the
feature of having no screen which is
fine but advertising that as a feature
of $2,500 is kind of wrong
you see how the arm is moving across the
vinyl as I navigate and that's a really
good thing because what do you think
this is a a techno build DIY Lego
project you have to control it using
this device there's no remotes and I
feel this is kind of a bit of a theme
with these minimal products I came into
this video expecting them all to
basically be the things that you're used
to but easier but it's kind of the
opposite they're the things you're used
to but they take away the things you
used to and sometimes they do it really
well they do record player did a good
job of course the record player has been
around for like 150 years it'd be kind
of sad if you messed that up now
actually more manual and less seamless
but the perk that I'm it's like
complimenting apple on making a phone
that doesn't you know drop calls like
you've been doing this
for 17 yeah 17 years thing is that that
manness encourages you to be
like complimenting Apple for making a
keyboard that you know it's easy to type
on which I
guess butterfly using them to really be
aware of think I typed on it like a few
times before because my cousin's a Mac
of course
I and of course I was like 10 back then
and to interact with them in a way that
allows you to appreciate them more like
I feel like if I listen to music on this
I'm going to listen to that music much
more intentionally than if I was just on
my Spotify discover weekly there
is well of course a Spotify discover
weekly is free I think this Cost $2,700
Plus it has the added subscription cost
of you needing to actually buy the
records which are not
cheap okay let's let's find a record
here I does Taylor make records I don't
know right Taylor Swift
according to the Taylor Swift official
store you can get a vinyl album
featuring 30 songs uh for $25 to $50 for
45 day deliver so let's just say $30 for
30 songs so a dollar a song it's
actually pretty good I guess for
subscription until you look at the
Alternatives you can have a th000 songs
for $0
with ads on
Spotify no doubt in my mind that this is
a highly over engineered product like it
even goes to the extent of understanding
if a vinyl you've placed on there is
Warped and then adjusting how it plays
that vinyl back accordingly but it's
done useful feature of course the people
have the money to spend that on probably
won't have War so that you the user you
only have to focus on the best parts of
the vient experience
that's good I wish there was a tiny bit
lower price maybe 2,000 I don't know
me oh
yeah I so see it I so see being the
sound sounds good but you
know I can find that song on YouTube you
got to do a comparison between say
spotify's version and that I mean you
can talk about the experience and stuff
like that but your experience is not
translate into money and C up next to a
fire with a hot tea and a vinyl it's an
extremely expensive way almost
unnecessarily expensive way to get that
experience but for someone who app kind
of like that what it called down Lane
episode where uh they returned the
record player back to the mor pretty
sure it wasn't this much though
appreciates it this is a product that
has no compromise we said to ourselves
before filming this video that anything
that scores above nine is coming with us
to our new
house 9.1
okay now let's get to the television oh
the television is before
this not that television it's a
different LG
television here we go LG L easel TV
$7,400 which you can even have that or
two record players
was about two times the already massive
size I was expecting it to be I'm pretty
sure this is the biggest thing I've ever
unboxed and yes I spent 10 minutes
getting through the entire packaging
only to realize that I unboxed it all
upside down so that's kind of funny yay
me although one cool thing is we go
here's the TV kind of like an easel but
I'm just trying to decide right now if
that actually makes any sense I will
give it the so here's the TV uh I will
say the col reproduction actually looks
really good these bezels with like the
titanium and the black kind of reminds
me of the s24 ultra
um and actually how the s22 also looks
much cooler because of the curve that
just it has this stand here which
is weird because I TV is on a stand of
course but it has it's it's like a c
it's like a cabinet so you can put stuff
in there you can put like DVDs or a
console or a DVD player um stuff perals
in there um and then you can play them
through the TV
um this is kind of weird of course
especially if you want to say let's say
you want to add a PS5 or a cable box or
literally anything there's nothing to
the back of there and of course you move
this back it's kind of weird this the TV
actually does look a lot prettier than I
was expecting it to and the screen
quality I'd expect it for $7,000 you
know most TVs are like $1,000 and you
can buy a TV at Walmart for $200 the
color saturation it's all beautiful it's
just why do I this looks reminds you of
Samsung wallpaper again want TV that
persistently looks like it's one light
Breeze away from serious Collateral
Damage I mean technically it won't be
because LG actually recommends that even
when it's in this slanted position it's
actually drilled into the wall which is
stupid because if it's drilled into a
wall then of course How You Gonna add
your cable boxes and stuff to it and if
you say hey it's not that kind of TV
then what are you doing with it like if
you can't add a cable box to it it means
no cable TV you're stuck with streaming
um and you can't add it's Roku or fire
stick and no gaming but then at that
point why does it need to be an easel
from everything we've seen so far there
is no function I think it does benefit
to having this as opposed to just wall
mounting your TV but there is one thing
that could change that so when you turn
the TV off and also most regular TVs
boom there it is right there so when you
Walmart those you can have the cables
traveling up if you wanted to wall mount
this and add anything to it you'd have
to mount the entire thing there which
means you have basically two TVs stacked
on top of each other except this cover
would be in way it's going to enter what
they call line View
mode so this is taking
advantage you technically have a
scalable amount of screen on show this
is your TVs always on display
effectively this should be a nice trick
to show people like you come in you have
like the clock showing you play some
music or play the wallpaper or something
maybe have like the uh
the that free TV that they're giving out
what's it
called the Teddy TV yeah
um where I have that ticker thing at the
bottom um let me see
here and you can show like sports scores
or ads or whatever um hope you can see
this on the screen
um of course it's at the
top and then you click the but then you
have the like Texans game one or
whatever what I'm curious about is how
much you can customize it oh that's
funky and then you can also display
those in front of some looks like it's
running uh Android in my opinion
interesting looking architectural
wallpapers is this just a grand waste of
electricity then it also gives you the
option for music oh that's quite a neat
way to actually display music in your
house many wavs you going to listen to
music okay at the Samsung frames um they
have this speaker that looks like a book
in this this video you have this TV and
of course you have the almost $4,000
record player oh oh I almost forgot the
Light phone which can play music of
course but no streaming so you have to
download the mp3s one by one of course
most MP3 websites are either illegal or
down by now because the last time
someone downloaded MP3 and SL loaded it
to a device was 2009 on iPod Touch
there's cool ideas here there's no doubt
about that but I just can't shake the
feeling that this like even the uh MP3
player I reviewed the pesu 5 or M4
whatever um it featured full Android and
it was just basically like a Android
tablet no s connectivity with a really
good dck in there and could play Spotify
YouTube music and title and stuff like
that high quality and of course you
could sad your own MP3s on there of
course I had to do the non-copyrighted
mp3s which me I ended up playing the
national amp good song but I doubt most
kids around here are going to be
listening to the nascal em on repeat
believe me I have the polling data
that's back it up this is basically a
slightly worse version of rollable TVs
that completely disappear when you're
done with them I see it as a product
that's trying to be a clear part of the
smart home you know this kind of piece
of furniture that's a little bit alive
it's a pretty tough product to rate
because yeah but got those stupid feet
there it is a spectacle and if you like
it you can't get that anywhere else but
no you can't get your own moving TV
cover anywhere else as far as the core
value for money proposition it's
basically like a two Grand TV with a
funky transforming mechanism that makes
it 7 and a half Grand so on that scale
it's a 6 out of 10 now as for the
treadmill I'm all right
um oh oh yeah let's go to the LG you
stand by me which is a television in a
case you're going to be the handsomest
wedding guest that look amazing I feel
like I can do anything move
over protect it cuz this is a 27in
touchscreen LCD monitor and I guess the
rest is battery whoa
okay oh my God what we have here so we
got our regular television application
are Apple TV Disney plus uh YouTube what
is this Netflix um and then you could
play some like simple mobile games here
cuz it's running Android and this it's
running Android but with LG's web
overlay on top of it oh or UI over it
goes to any height and then also pivots
based on the angle you want to look at
it from this would be really good for
like say presentations just plugging
your phone maybe getting some work done
this says Dolby Vision Atmos which means
I assume this part is speakers that's a
very interesting Prospect the idea of
carrying your entire Cinema in one go
and I realize it seems incredibly
excessive but I can also think of and
it's battery powered which I guess would
be good for schools um it's only $9.99
which some TV are like 2,000 1,000 so
999 for a battery power TV of course can
run over the on its own power 27 inches
you can do presentations so even if say
there's a power issue or you want to
move the TV to somewhere where everyone
can see um that easier than having to
you
know pick up the Smartboard stuff and
it's touch
screen and you can do some of like
collab work on it it can be like a cheap
version of those tables quite a few
moments where I've wished that something
like this existed like the Nintendo
switch for example so many times I've
taken this thing to places that don't
have an external screen to plug into and
so you end up in a situation where you
pull out the kickstand and it's four
people crouched around a 7in display I
don't know who would be playing Nintendo
switch like outside maybe but like if
you're going over to someone's house to
have like a gaming party or something I
mean a TV is like one of the
prerequisites I think not that I've ever
been to a gaming party but I'm pretty
sure a uh TV would be a prerequisite to
game party okay so what better way to
break the screen in than with a smash
with my arch rival I've only seen this
game play like three times I don't even
understand what it this these are like
random characters from the Mario
Universe fight each other
something
Joseph oh no no no no no no no no no
this is not representative one thing
I'll say for absolute certainty there is
a massive amount of input lag
here yeah interesting though I don't
think this would be like meant for
gaming because if it was meant for this
kind of gaming not like the mobile
gaming as you see on
here I I I don't think it would be meant
for that cuz like the switch is the only
portable console no one's going to be
dragging their PS5 outside cuz you still
need
your power power switch for that but you
know's going to be drinking the the T
drag that around and then gaming um is
it more for consuming content or I guess
um presentations from your phone yeah
this is definitely not designed for
gaming the screen looks quite impressive
from a distance but up close you can
absolutely tell that it's a 1080p panel
yeah this is like the one spot where you
need a 4K UH 60 frame per second
display cuz you know he's literally 15
in away from it i' say it's a pretty
respectable audio experience well it is
cool that you're getting this all in one
we done with this we're g to talk about
the app on my phone and Sony and chat
GPT you're paying $1,200 for it and this
is not a 1,200 oh UK cuz it's like $999
in the US I think $1,200 monitor are you
still
going
him
no oh dude now one thing though that
might make this a little bit more
interesting is home look at this it even
comes with its own reme this is LG's
home menu and it's not a full-blown
Android device it doesn't have access to
everything like your phone does but it's
well I
mean Google docs on that I mean if you
think about it it's kind of like Samsung
M8 M7 which is very famous article think
about you can put up Google Docs if you
could um have a
really maybe pretty good as far as TVs
go so it's got entertainment things like
Channel 4 ITV and then also game which
is a combination of 10% of games that
you'd actually probably quite enjoy and
90% that you wouldn't want to touch with
the barge ball we can play a full game
of chess obviously we wouldn't be
craning this way because we'd be playing
it when it's flat it's not I think
that's good it' be better than having
like bring a whole chest shed outside
might lose the night on a look wa for
the King which then you can play not a
super slick polished experience it's
actually the opposite of the play date
in a lot of but it's functional if you
really want to play a game of chess on a
27 in screen sitting on a beach you can
do that but that's actually part of the
problem because the website's very
strange it says that it has up to three
hours of battery life and then in the
same breath that you can watch movies
while on the beach with three hours of
battery life as an absolute upper
limit well yeah but it also has its
own power connectivity and like the
Mario movie was an hour and 30 minutes
so
that it's a bit of a stretch to say that
you can watch multiple movies there's
Netflix there's depends on how long that
movie is Time video it's also good Tik
Tock TV and I think Tik Tok yes
wow Tik Tock infect comes for our TVs it
come for our phones that's a sight when
have you ever seen anyone do this before
like I'm not going to lie I do find this
really cool but at the same time I feel
like if that is what you're going to be
using this for you have made a terrible
purchase well Ian if you're just using
Tik Tok you have made a terrible I think
that's where we're going to end this
video not this video this video not the
podcast episode for now but now let's
talk about our face ranking mobile
application
um which is server based so yeah um to
Wi
tool Wiz photos which is a really good
photo editor um I like it a lot it has
it does have ads in it but you
can skipped them um you can import up to
Tin photos here um to edit and so you
got your normal photo uh tools here but
you also have interesting stuff like
reshaping lens correction um and you can
add multiple layers portrait effects so
it's a interesting thing here oh and
also has face swapping technology which
I have to test out so if tell me if you
guys want to see review of this but you
can add multiple features AI cartoon
text face tune um slideshow but then it
has this duplicates finder I haven't
even seen this face Raider thing here
and I tried to test it on Disney
Princesses because obviously we W going
to test it on real people and of course
the the um Disney Princesses and
Princess you can use the back and front
cameras um it kind of had a problem on
my screen I guess it was too bright so
like all the white Disney print just
they're kind of like blown out you
couldn't really rank them or rank them
like lower than what some of the uh
things on the website said I tested it
against a website that like rank them
according to Beauty because obviously
we're not going to give an opinion on
that um and of course everyone is I
guess made by God readful in their own
way etc etc of course I know some of you
guys saying well you know beauty isn't
subjective blah blah blah I read post
Martin times I know I listen to L
episodes I know I know I know okay but
I'm just talking about this own context
so you guys typing in the comments can
all come down um so it um has a face
raer and you can use the camera or you
can select the photo in the gallery and
it will scan the face and will give you
a
ranking uh and an age ranking which is
totally wrong
um and it can determine if they're a boy
or a girl so that is good so check it
out uh tool Wiz photos now there's
another photo app I like on here it's
called pixel I think we've talked about
this before uh it can scan faces on your
phone all on device and uh match them
for you so I really like that feature of
course Samsung gallery has that
but Samson G has that
but
uh it's nice to see this coming to other
devices well even more cre the Samsung
gallery but now let's talk about ttbt
40 all right six days ago from chat GPT
so GPT the O stands for Omni has much
more natural human computer interaction
um especially on the multiple side of
things because you can use the camera
and audio input and um PES fair
multimodal and here are some videos of
its
capabilities today we're going to try
something new and tys of tech actually
point out that these devices iPhone here
iPhone there which that
is
awful wait a second I have the CH GPT
app how do it
get talk to another AI this AI is going
to be able to see the world it's going
to have a camera I'll be holding it and
so you can direct it you can direct me
to ask questions um about whatever you
want them to do but really try to figure
out what's what does it see um and this
could have to be really interesting for
accessibility can you know tell you what
you see around the world voice instead
having the tight stuff and and ask
questions appropriately how does that
sound well well well just when I thought
things couldn't get any more interesting
talking to another AI that can see the
world this sounds like a plot twist in
the AI Universe all right let's do this
I'm pause for one moment and did you
notice how it interrupts I having to say
like a wake away like
gpg you got
it so now that first a I can't hear
anything hello AI today you're going to
have wait a second I think I have that
let me check let me check let me
check I got my phone
out um okay okay okay gotta go in and
get the
app it's GNA be interesting let's do a
live demonstration on air
okay
loading of course the free version
people only get limited minutes on it
this says looks like it oh D you came
back
okay oh I don't have it yet at least I
don't have that
version all I need chat GPT plus access
chat GPT
40 unfortunate of course we don't have
the1 19.99 amount for
that access to see the world but as you
can see you can see the world and
everything and every device that they
showed was an iPhone um so or Apple
device so that is interesting that I can
do
that also people have been using it to
turn um data into charts um from
spreadsheets
um what else they use it to do something
else I forgot oh um summarize stuff make
their own fonts so the feels like it's a
very useful
application and they also added a chat
GPT um desktop
application so let's rout Ro rout for
the
home
no what was
that sorry guys I got carried
away but as you can see here it even
talks back to you so it looks like a
very fine application and I spend lots
of time with it um D what do you think
about
this okay so GPT 40 Tex image
capabilities are um in my phone um on
the free tier and voice mode is coming
to chat GPT Plus in the coming weeks so
I don't have that right now
um yeah okay
um I tried to learn blender this week
unfortunately my computer crashed after
I started making my donut so that is
sad all right any other topics that you
want to see discussed on on the podcast
I think there's an AR app on here that I
downloaded
so
architect oh I wonder if I can see this
apple in AR and why is everything in
Russian okay yes it's downloading an
apple let's see what this app architect
looks like all right it's pointing
pointing thanks
let me turn the flash
on oh there it is a transparent
Apple me tap it oh no it's not
transparent anymore it is a full
Apple actually let's make the screen
big we got a full Apple here guys with
good shadows and it's one to one and you
can even take
pictures so there a apple I wonder if I
can let me make my own stuff oh and you
can 3D view
stuff so that is
interesting oh there's also a scanning
thing in here let's
you scan QR code let scan for 3D all
right any other topics you want to
discuss let see we talked about GPT 40 I
think it's really interesting
um it's going to change education um
some people were saying notebook LM
really really good AI tool
um I follow this account let me just
keep scrolling scrolling scrolling
scrolling
um come on it's an AI account over on
Instagram oh there uncover AI so it's
telling us some of the stuff that the uh
thing was
doing o and they give us interesting AI
tools so here's what people are using
GPT 40 for and they're kind of spaming
like they make you comments they have to
get DM links um so it's spreadsheet into
charts which honestly it's kind of
stupid because like spreadsheets have
been able to do that since the 80s
um super fast responses I like that uh
your own personal to to WR in your
pocket it can do like math and stuff um
I really like that because the way math
is taught on the internet is really
confusing I guess it might be some of
the font and typ typographic stuff it's
kind of sad that like this person is
obviously using a Macbook here and he
just using gep G4 and uh like some other
Financial website and then text the font
that's really
good document understanding that's
interesting here this is kind of boring
that just basically scam in and
transcription you've been able to do
that before but I do like that GPC is
able to do it transcription and OCR that
really good when I was secretary uh well
when the other secretary took notes and
then I transcribed them into the
computer database not database online
stuff
school okay let's see what other videos
we have
here oh Sony Sony
Sony released their new phone
unfortunately it's not coming to the
United States of America and some people
are speculating that it has left leaving
the market for
good um that is
unfortunate um here is the new Sony
Experia 1 Mark 6 um that's the new phone
so um if you want to type this into a
Google search engine U that'll be x p e
r i a one and then VI which is the new
flagship phone all right so according to
tech
radar um it will be sporting the is
sporting the um SN Dron 8 gen 3 chip so
it's the flagship chip that is in most
Android uh Flagship smartphones these
days so it's not going to be power SLS
um and according to Adam Matlock over at
techy it should work on American fans
but here we go who the specs
this what the phone looks like they
changed the aspect ratio and the screen
um um so it's not 4K anymore um it still
features a headphone jack and the front
facing camera is it's not a DOT so it's
still full screen
219
um so no more no more
4K has a 12 megapixel telephoto camera
that Zooms in between focals of 85 to 70
NM um 170 NM which means it's a
continuous zoom in between 3 and a half
to 7.1 which means this I wanted to zoom
in on using this phone here Galaxy s22
plus it has a three time zoom camera so
if I zoom in at three times it's going
to be the best zoom that you get on the
phone if I zoom in at say five times
it's going to be using the optical and
digital cropping it so it's going to
take pictures with it three times and
then just kind of like crop into it to
make it a five right here it's going to
be completely Optical which means it's
better quality because it's not using
software interpretation and basically
cropping which lowest to Quality all
right for instance I'm going to take a
picture
here at three times Zoom right am taking
a picture of my camera okay and now I'm
going to zoom in at uh
five all right so the pictures are still
going to look good so this is what the
three times image looks
like oh hopefully you can
see so this
is this is three
times oh no sorry this is three times
and this is five times right now um
according to the data that's collected
the exf data on the pictures that
collected the five times Zoom picture um
is 12 MEAP
interesting this one's still 12
megapixels it takes up
more interesting uh on most phones this
one I guess it's different um it would
actually be a lower megapixel count
because it's cropped in image all right
now you here we are back to the screen
but anyway the zoom here would be a lot
better uh the telephoto camera also
takes macro um interesting because most
of the time when they do macro on phones
like on s24 Ultra it's actually from the
ultra ride um and a 5,000 minute battery
that's good and it says 36 hours continu
video playback Samsung claims 30 for
their phone so if that's true better
battery on the Sony voice is not coming
to the United States of America and it
is coming with um FBS 12 gig ram 26 GB
storage just like the ultra and a Micro
SD card slot and three user Android
updates which is good um it's better
than its normal thing
though I wonder if the
EU EU was so annoying um is going to
start mandating phones get more updates
um which would be
sad o you ordered a flipper zero really
I might order one of those things um so
uh what are you going to do with
it cuz I like it because it's a
convergent hacking device it's like a
smartphone packing uh that should be fun
yes what kind of fun I wanted to spam
someone's phone with the iOS
s nice um how far away can you clone
because I've seen those RFID cloners and
I wanted to know if you could like long
range clone that be so fine but terrible
for Access Control
people all right now let's get to
our uh of the
week and it's
loading all right let's see yes yes you
can do that to phon Bluetooth and get it
yeah yeah I know I meant like RFID tag
spoofing let's say it's like you know
those hotel Key ID spoofing devices and
you want it to long range spoof so like
100 feet away you point the gun at it
and it cloned
it all right YouTube is still loading so
we're
waiting oh
okay so here is the quote unquote creepy
iPad commercial and we all know what
he's going to say about this and how
it's the downfall of Western
Civilization so kind of Funny's I
haven't even watched this video but I
know what he's going to
say he's going to start y 30 minutes
about how is this terrible and
anti-christian etc
etc come
on o 50 Mets no no not for Bluetooth
RFID 50 meters for BL for rid would be
insane unless it's like those license
plate skinners that's different and it
causes more building your online
business
go to wix.com
and set up your store on a single
integrated
platform add product I mean let's just
listen to this description which he went
on and on about the the the quote
unquote the the how stores prove the
incarnate world and something something
something I'm like
got what all here's the description uh
Apple CEO Tim Cook post an advertisement
for an iPad and it's creepy Apple
thought that it was really cool that we
don't need stuff anymore we live in an
incarnate world so we do all need that
stuff what no one okay uh let me tell
you no one needs
uh 25 ft for FID yes you can make a
Christian AI they plenty of Christian AI
I they think that it's like demons or
the Antichrist or influencers or
something like that which is crazy
um wait wait wait oh
yes um here we go which I'm a big fan of
him but I he's just wrong here we go
there is a real creepy iPad commercial
yes real creepy it shows Crush uh well
technically nothing's neutral if you um
there's a video back from like a year
ago in the channel and it's giving AI
That's saying like obviously blatantly
antichristian responses about the age of
the Earth ETA Etc um and like how AI um
won't tell you what the only way to
Salvation is
um but so I I will say that AI does skew
well some AI prams do skew towards uh
non-Christian values um so it can't
technically be neutral but this isn't
even about AI this is about an Apple
iPad commercial that's getting crushed
uh that has just been pushed by Apple I
I don't know really what I mean is it a
good commercial no probably not but is
it terrible and anti-christian and no
well I guess it would be subjective to
the developer point of view but to God's
point of view which is the only point of
view that matters it's not subjective
um
because which is why the AI could be SE
as anti-god because like no one cares
what all the other false method for
salvation um will be in
end the marketing people at Apple we're
thinking here this the marketing people
at Apple are used to be pretty good also
gone viral except for that mother that
was
stupid even even those who
don't uh examine the implicit ideology
of this yes the implicit ideology who on
o cares about the implicit ideology okay
now now okay I agree with you on the
mother o commercial right that's stupid
okay that was a dumb commercial and
apple was rightly CR criticized but the
implicit ideology of taking a hydraulic
press and and
smacking
uh some like some toys like it's not
even important stuff like a Bible no it
now if they went around and like did
that then yeah I could get the outrage
but they just took some random 80s game
console not console arcade machine and
they
um like some random book some emoji icon
thing well yeah but then that's why the
AI would have
bias all the way down to the very last
detail recognize something is real
creepy going on here no no no no one
recognizes that only you and like three
other people who have nothing like there
are real problems in the world that you
can go solve and talk about and here you
are talking about an iPad commercial
like so I don't want to get copyright
struck you can go see this Coos online
it'll take stuff like record players and
and say I have a piano and some paint
and it's going to all crush it together
and it produces this very powerful in4
powered
iPad congratulations uh let's get to the
commentary and how this is I look the
compos was a minut actually more
like a minute long this reaction is it's
a new iPad Pro
when Apple launched they had their 1984
style advertisement you know Apple's
going to
say and once again these people stand on
names and talk about what they need to
talk about Christianity and stuff like
that Apple did not launch with the 1984
style ad they launched
and they launched in um
1976 but [ __ ] we'll give you that same
people uh once again when we talk about
the Apple Vision Pro um someone thought
that augumented reality that meant that
the Apple Vision play was going to make
your reality better that's not what
augumented reality means and they also
thought that Apple's Apple Pro was going
to spy on you when you go to the
bathroom which was genuinely stupid like
who's G to run around with the VR
headset on when they go to the bathroom
think different we're gonna we're going
to throw a wrench at Big Brother who's
trying to make us all conform and just
bring us all down into this this uniform
kind of bland
World BR first of all I paid him for $2
to $3,000 I guarantee you not everyone's
gonna be using the iPad because they
can't afford it well um they're talking
about the 1984 Apple commercial uh right
now no no one can afford this $2,000 to
$3,000 iPad okay so I guarantee you that
it's not going to be conformed and
planned and besides you are literally
selling
cigars I like I that is objectively
worse for society than this Apple
at well now apple is it's been around
long enough it's taking the other side
of that commercial it's now on the Big
Brother side what did Apple think when
they were making look is it a bad
commercial probably yeah crushing up
people's stuff and saying hey yeah
but no no it's not a terrible incarnate
thing that needs to be analyzed in a
sin Apple thought that it's really
really cool that we don't need stuff
anymore so it is kind of cool uh in my
opinion like you can do all of this you
don't have to drag all that around you
can just put put it in iPad of course of
course Samsung I use a Samsung tablet
but you you don't need any of the stuff
that was in the commos you don't need a
piano you don't need a record player you
don't need a game console okay um and
you really don't need stuff okay I've
read the Bible uh there's no verse in
there about uh you need stuff sorry so
you don't need a trumpet you don't need
a TV you don't need book you don't need
a trumpet you don't need a TV I mean
sure you might say you need books but
you don't need a drawing desk you don't
need sculpture you you honestly don't
you don't need toys you don't need
anything well well I mean half of your
company here has literally
attacked seriously my gosh half you
coming here has literally attacked toys
so this is might be a good thing well
see they might be like hey well see the
Apple thing they're replacing toys with
tablets but I guarantee you not many
kids going be running around with this
brand new iPad inf4 because it's
$2,000 you can replace all the stuff in
your life with a little slate
tablet which he's making this sound bad
where he's trying to make make it sound
bad but it actually sounds pretty
interesting on which you can rent and
stream a digital simulacrum of
everything you enjoy
simu is that even a word let's check
that I think this guy's is Sim U a a c u
m
Sim an image representation of something
or someone
else yeah I I have ever ever heard the
word simum use and he's talking about a
tablet and second of all um you can rent
and stream a digital thing of every
physical thing okay uh have you ever
heard of a DVD rer
you well you don't that's a web
streaming content so it's kind of like
CUA anyway uh anyway uh uh I don't know
about you but has he heard of a web of a
DVD repper so you take you use this
thing you take a DVD it takes a DVD and
it puts the MP4 onto your iPad now the
legality of that is iffy I think you can
use them now um second of all you can
still download movies and you don't have
to stream them okay and if you're
talking about replacing TV with a tablet
a tablet's just a small TV and most TV
is streamed anyway of hood of live TV or
or cable TV I
mean uh I I I want to ask you how many
DVD uh players well yeah these people
don't have Tech degrees which is why
they should stop talking about tech and
do their
jobs you know I was talking to Jeremy
about this ad the other day and Jeremy
said he said you know in the first cut
of that they had a Bible in there
because why would they no they would not
they did not it is tiring to have to
defend Apple okay I don't like apple I'm
not a fan of them but I mean this is
stupid because you know you can get your
Bible on your iPad well actually maybe
we shouldn't smush the Bible you know
you well yeah but then also then they'd
have to you know advertise the Bible app
and they wouldn't want to do that
because what you have to assume because
they had everything
else um that is a big stretch like like
a huge stretch I can name 10 things that
they did not have in that commercial
like a car uh exercise equipment uh
robots a phone because I still want you
to buy an iPhone um
earbuds um oh this
again greetings and salutations a you
have any more questions to ask
me uh
wallpaper so why don't people like that
I mean he he's making his hand dresses
like he's being so
profound you're talking about an iPad
commercial you paid millions of dollars
to talk about an iPad
commercial I think it's kind of cool
when I travel
now interesting he actually thinks it's
cool shocking take of course there still
seven minutes left of this take from the
Yap and moan and whine and groan about
how terrible apple is for society I
don't even take a laptop I take an iPad
because they when you have an iPad they
let you keep riding during takeoff and
landing on an airplane so it saves me
time when I'm running late on my
speeches
interesting how long do your takeoffs
take but whatever but also because I I
can fit a lot on there and I can I can
keep my books on there and I can stream
baseball on there and I can watch my you
don't even watch sports I watch your
show enough to know you don't watch
sports
uh my political content and I can write
and I can do everything on yes yes we
know what an iPad
is what but I don't want to just have
a told you an iPad I want to have my
musical instruments I want to have my
books and I want to have that's good um
let me tell you Apple's not in a book
company book business apples n in the
music business uh and apples n in the
drawing business it's saying that you
can do this now this commercial would be
bad if Apple went around and went into
people's houses and took their
instruments and their books and their
drawing equipment and then all boned in
the bonfire and just replace an iPad
that'd be illegal and wrong what they're
saying is that you can replace it I'm
not saying that you have to no one's
forcing you to buy a $2,000 iPad in fact
Apple themselves probably doesn't even
want you to buy this
iPad like apple themselves is pricing
this thing higher than a Macbook Okay so
you have actually want this iPad okay
they're not no one's forcing you to um
go out and buy uh the
iPad have my desk and I want to have my
colors and I want to have my toys and I
want to have interesting do you want to
have toys because I seem to remember
Brett Cooper and Matt also uh being
anti- toy uh for people over the age of
12 or 20 or something like that um so
interesting take there I like to see a
debate
because that'll be a much more
productive use of time about um than
um slamming Apple over the commercial um
not saying that a debate over toys would
also be useful like
really like why was that even wor
podcast time yapping about how
40-year-old people shouldn't use Star
Wars toys like that the other things
that you can
do why don't people like this because we
live in an incarnate world
he's the first person to ever use the
word
incarnate to describe an Apple
commercial or any technical
commercial that's why because we're
physical and we live uh I'm sorry but um
tablets are also physical they're not
Holograms second of
all the TV was also digital and physical
in fact you could argue that uh iPad is
more physical than gaming on a TV or
watching TV because you're holding in
your hand and controlling and using the
gyroscopes and sensors everything to
game live in time and space and we form
connect uh do you know what also lives
in time and space the iPad I don't know
about this phone here see uh it's in the
same time and space that I am I can
interface with it by touching on the
screen I can take a picture of the
physical when it comes digital
actions two things and we don't want to
be materialists we don't want to to lose
sight of Eternity we don't want to
forget
about look look I'm Christian you're
Christian it's an iPad ad put it to rest
the metaphysical things that physical
things
signify what are you talking about but
neither do we want to just pretend that
our bodies don't matter and we're just
you know ideas floating in space we're
not what are you talking
about we are not that's something we're
learning out of the trans ideology
that's some what the
what yeah yeah yeah yeah all right that
our Elites keep pushing on us deep and
he's just gonna call on this y session
for okay there we go that's the
take uh any opinions on that which you
still
have how does he keep talking about an
iPad ad for that long um yeah so that's
the take um I obviously disagree with
that now was add the best choice no was
it awful and um a
conspiracy from random people on the
internet uh
no not at
all um
let's see what
any comment we have
here yeah and it's kind of sad because I
like him a lot but I mean he's wrong
right here
um
yeah okay any other
uh things that we want to talk about on
the podcast on
that um uh Samsung did respond to it by
saying physical things are funny but you
see it's actually Samsung's job to
respond to Apple's ads because Samsung
is a tech company and this is capitalism
and
um uh they can capitalize off of
people's angle Michael is a
news person he's
a he's a online news uh reporter uh and
that has nothing to do in his niece or
in his
job
uh well I mean he had to bring it back
to his niece somehow I mean he he's not
a tech
commentator in fact here we have right
here an LG
um that's similar to the Apple
commercial so let's let's put it up
right here and uh of course he wasn't
online when this happened but um LG
didn't get as
much hate probably because no one bought
the thing but here we go here is LG and
there's the Apple LG is
squeezing stuff to got this from 2008
and it's not for a tablet because those
weren't really things for consumers back
then cameras is squeezing them all
together into one device a camera phone
with an 8 megapixel camera and then the
course the iPad comes together um for
the vano kc910 phone
um
yeah yeah go because I'm a big fan of
his of course big fan of uh Christian of
course but that's honestly not he has
other stuff to do all right um if that's
all for now I guess we'll stay on until
for two
hours um what other devices can we talk
about um oh yeah u.com has added GPT for
Turbo and the new Gemini to
um to the thing oh I gotta to you oh we
got to talk
about
um oh here we go oh yes we will get a
report on The Flipper zero next week
thank you very much all right
um where wa oh yes so even that $3,000
iPad one thing that we said that we
didn't see in the commercial was a phone
we got apple and their all their
wisdom did not include calling
capabilities on that iPad which is very
sad since it cost
$3,000 well let's talk about Windows XP
to finish off this podcast uh here we go
Windows
XP uh how to geek of course you guys
should not be using Windows XP um
anymore it's very insecure okay uh
anyone can hack into it just like a
click of button if it's connected to
internet
so this is why Windows XP is so popular
according to how to
geek
it
uh had low system requirements and
stability and software support uh good
software support according to howto geek
oh here you
go um it also has lots of staying power
because its last security update was
released
uh 10 years ago in 2014 uh which was
which is over 13 years over 12 years 13
years after the original Rel State and
it was long because most people didn't
like to upgrade to Windows Vista so it
was more like XP to Windows 7 and the UI
was uh apparently good so command prompt
uh task manager control panel will
introduced and perfected into or
perfected into
XP and uh according to this article it
felt familiar now I've used XP before it
looks interesting it does have some
features that even modern District uh
distributions do not have
um like I think got some type of sharing
thing um or like you can hack them uh
like I think you can send an IP message
to someone else send
a oh speaking of IP addresses um I
almost forgot about our
our
um our Odyssey Blog The Odyssey boy at
blogspot.com um I figured out how Moy
was able to track Seymour Kraken uh with
her IP address so fast so in this
episode the team uh Moy was able
to trace this kid from IP address to a
specific location I was confused on how
he did that um because he like set up a
honey platform and I think that since
Seymour KRA didn't know anything about
hacking and his hacker friend helped set
him up um to prevent him from having a
hard time from hacking into systems he
gave him a static IP address you have a
static IP address um you can figure out
where it's registered and wherever it's
registered boom you get the location so
I think that's how Mo did it so here we
go speaking of hacking and NSA and stuff
does Odyssey actually know what NSA does
because
like here we go so the NSA is America's
Fame digital spite agency in real life
they go around and like intercept
Communications and tab Communications to
other countries using uh agents to in uh
ADV Odyssey they apparently do the job
of the CIA the FBI the and the DIA
potentially so which is the uh the
defense intelligence agency they do
military intelligence stuff okay so FBI
that's domestic and and CIA that's
overseas so Jason Whitaker plays a pival
role in the blacket as a counter
terrorism agent investigating Red
Scorpion uh in Geneva Switzerland okay
so NSA does not have that many foreign
operatives though they do have people
tapping the communications networks of
other countries so he could have been in
there and then he just kind of like just
went rogue and helped save the people so
I guess that is why agency sration
because Jason knows tatcha and knows all
the tricks and stuff like that so then
another episode Jason produced a device
that can hack into computer vport I
looked it up those don't exist but NSA
probably has stuff that can do that so
that is feasible and makes sense
um and then in the books NSA is able to
steal applesauce from which's computer
remotely uh that is NSA level technology
right there okay so the in the search
for wet episodes uh the NSA is
investigating smugglers in the Middle
East now these were fit taped in the 90s
so technically NSA wasn't even a
uh given a real agency in the eyes of
the public um yeah n does not search for
SM m in uh in the Middle East that's not
even what they do like that would
technically be like the cia's job but
like see I would not care about random
Middle Eastern
smug in in Israel
um so Whit was going to the Middle East
anyway on a foreign on a mission strip
so maybe they just send him there
because he had agency experience and
said hey well might as well do this for
us anyway um and
then Jason also investigates cyber crime
which makes sense uh but then he um he
gets killed fake killed by someone which
he gets investigated so um he goes into
green ring which uh he takes on the job
of the Secret Service investigating
counterfeit money he goes under cover U
on American soil and uh English soil
which takes on the job with the FBI and
the
CIA so maybe maybe uh because of his
cyber crime investigations like black
had a lot of cyber crime and not
electronic communication uh which is a
special T type machine that communicates
its level of 1980s in 1940s technology
um and then there's this these new AI
programs coming out which in apple
program and which the coding jobs for
other stuw he made probably makes NSA
like obviously a big hub for the NSA so
they just do lots of operations out of
there and then they just make Jason go
around and do stuff for him because he
can and he he knows Mr Whitaker uh
because you know they related and then
Jason is killed which means all that bad
the guys think he's dead so then he
might be able to transfer um to the CA
and FBI because of his agency experience
uh in in
Ina um and then later in the S Saga he
probably goes to the DIA uh do and joins
the da to get the cach for the submarine
missiles for 28 album Saga but of course
to maintain the security he still works
for Ina which is why Jillian has refed
from Rivals who found out he's not dead
because obviously Tasha knows he's still
alive um from Mor Saga um however J is
traveling the globe which doesn't make
sense um given her placement in Odyssey
and one last thing on Odyssey which is
what will the next Saga in Odyssey be um
so Whit really hasn't had like a evil
person Tred to counter him since novacom
since MO is like goodish now I guess um
so we haven't had like an evil Saga
thing happened since like 2002 who oh
well guess green ring but they didn't
really interact with Mr Whitaker he just
had to like take them down and then I
guess TI that bind they went really evil
people trying to like take down witchin
they just like different ideologies um
which is evil but you know not like you
know like not like the black would Noom
sagas um so what do you think the next
Saga will be of course we still have the
bucket Jewel Saga um finishing up but
there hasn't been really a calendar to
wit since 2002 2010 depending or 11
depending on when you talk about that of
course um back then they had the apple
baby cell phone so I wanted to kind of
Hightech stuff apple apple Odyssey will
produce but um for a counter to Mr wi
but I guess uh you guys can leave your
thoughts and questions into the comments
that's all for now we got 15 seconds
left on the podcast stream to make this
exactly two hour long episode so if you
have any questions spit them in 8 seven
six 5 4 4 3 2 and one God bless and talk
to you later</pre>
