<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 10524</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to this
weekend The Tech booy podcast I'm
finally live at 7:20 p.m central time we
have lots to get to today and right
after this live um uh goes live um we
will have uh a new SSA ltw story um SSA
Declassified story up right now but we
have so much to talk about today Samsung
one UI 6 which is Samsung oneui um 7
Samsung um Galaxy uh updates and the
iPhone SE 4 is also coming out also
Gemini live co-pilot and um sorry Gemini
copilot and chat gbt all got updates
they all got live voice interfaces I'll
interface with them live on the show
right now as well as do some reporting
that we had on the tech.org also Samsung
Galaxy Tab S10 tablets um have been
released and here's what it can spelled
for the Samsung Galaxy s26 series set to
launch in 2026 on
uh what upse
oh yes phones losing the original
purpose and electric cars versus gas
cars my take on this has GED some uh
clapback because of course all right
think all right guys we currently lost
our camera so right back to laptop
webcam o that looks awful let me see if
I can fix it tou Up
Appearance there anyway
um yeah so our our regular camera has
been going out for some reason oh and
also the battle for Air Supremacy I
recently tested two Air Force style
games um on Android and we'll get into
that so first let's talk about uh gim oh
oh and it is October 5th which means it
has been
360 five no five days since yeah it's a
leap year since I claimed that um
provincial applications were essentially
malware on that very controversial
stream from October 7th all right um so
let's get into this Gemini live co-pilot
and Microsoft Gemini live co-pilot and
chat GPT all got um updates um today
starting or not today but this week
starting now on Android phones you can
now talk to Gemini live so let's see
what she has to say for
us all right hey could you talk to my
say hi to my friend on podcast stream
right
now unfortunately I can't talk directly
to your friends on their podcast is
there anything you say hello to all of
them sure I can do that let's craft the
perfect message the overall vi just say
hi right now they can all hear you clear
maybe something like hey there this is
Gemini a large language model I'm
friends with username and wanted to say
hello all right so that is Gemini live
right there and this is what his user
interface looks like it kind of looks
like cell phone um if you if you look at
it right here you have end which be hang
up and hold buttons and then you have
regular Gemini and actually transcribes
what you're um trying to say um as
you're talking to it and I found that
it's useful but it's very very wrong on
things right um I asked it
um when uh the Steelers last played on
Monday Night Football and it told me
that they played on October
3rd um a Sunday night football and told
me they played on October 3rd against
the CTS or something like that um for
those of you who don't know watching in
the future October 3D was a Thursday and
the Steelers did not play all right um
and they also didn't play the CTS on
that day whatever all right but when we
get into Gemini live versus co-pilot
versus um chat gbt um there's lots of
things that go into that but um it it it
really comes down to voice and accuracy
and I haven't done any accuracy tests
right now but voice is really really
important so I called this article the
battle of the voices and I hope you like
this um image that copy actually
generated copy went through a full
redesign actually I'm going to pull this
up on the screen um it's more dark it
has news it lets you listen to um and
it's
more it kind of reminds me of the AI
application po which is more of a
personal AI app and something that's
supposed to be productive um you can
message it and you can talk to it on
live um so let's get into
that hi one hey co- pilot what are you
up to
today just hanging out waiting to see
where we go next yeah and one of the
things that I've noticed too is the
voices Gemini is is completely
completely ahead oh hello Elijah and
welcome to the show um thanks for
watching so yeah Gemini is completely
ahead on tombs of voices co-pilot um it
might be a bit more accurate um I did
try to get it to generate My article for
me um on voice but it didn't do that
good of a job the thing I am interested
in is if we can get the speeds correct
and the voices to be less robotic and
more uh in more human sounding and I
think users prefer uh female sounding
voices compared to male sounding voices
on um their smart assistant so hopefully
uh chat gbt can fix that issue I has
like one and the voice is terrible um
here's
gem um and co-pilot yeah so I I rank it
Gemini co-pilot chat GPT um and one
thing I would like to say is co-pilot's
uh image generation technology is
actually faster I'm going to go live
right now um come on chat tell me what
you want um co-pilot to generate and um
we'll put it in and then I'll start
timing it so you have to say
generate but I do miss the pixelation
technology that you could have on Gemini
some the advanced features that it had
in the uh image generation technology in
fact when you head over to ssw
blogspot.com and share the
tab yep there we go some of these images
will pixelated within you can't see some
of these images were pixelated within uh
co-pilot instead of me using my
pixelator uh application all right and
since chat hasn't gotten back to us with
what we're supposed to generate I'm just
going to have it generate a
futuristic cell phone all right three
two one one Mississippi two Mississippi
three
Miss what it's saying image generation
doesn't want to it doesn't want to
generate stuff today well that that is
unfortunate so no generation over there
I haven't actually tested out co-pilots
I mean Gemini's generation let's see
what it can do here um um let's see I'm
gonna ask it to generate um one thing I
did notice is that you can't really
generate stuff or take notes in live
it's supposed to be more of like a
conversational thing so I hope it's
trying to lean lean into
uh sorry lean
into um being more personal and
communicable um so let's have copilot um
come into here I mean sorry not Co
Gemini um on the regular text to speech
mode not live mode all right generate a
futuristic cell
phone oh and it's generating with image
in 2 image in 3 is coming soon and
Elijah says that AI is being janky and
wow these cell phones do look pretty
futuristic I did get three images that
is one thing to note copy will only
generate one image so this is a
transparent cell phone and then we have
a folding cell phone that looks like a
butterfly in like futuristic China maybe
maybe it's based off the Huawei phones
and then we have uh I don't know what
this is this taking me back to 2010 so
the image generation technology still
could get better I wonder if it can
generate white people now because that
was an issue back in uh 20
uh in what was that month February let's
see
generate a 19yearold
white basically able
Haru um so here we go let's see if we
can generate
that and all right all right we haven't
been banned
yet and they still haven't brought back
people yet so hopefully Google can get
that Tech working soon all right
speaking of photo leap still amazing
make sure to check out um AA Harper over
on Instagram we gotted across 300
followers we at 293 we're so close so
hopefully we can um get better um than
that all right so um let's talk about
electric uh cause so someone was talking
about electric cause
and um I I I I had an interesting take
as all my takes tend to be always
controversial um so let's see if I can
pull it up on the screen and while I'm
doing that let's see what the chat has
to say um so here I'm going to search
see if I I Mark these right now we have
so much to get to by the way
um yeah that sounds bad um okay let's
see
gas and see
from
me yes here it is so I had a
debate um that of course as you know
greatest internet debater of all time um
I always win my internet
um so here here we are um hopefully you
guys can see this on the screen Elon
Musk said that um almost all vehicles
will be pure purely electric long-term
combustion cars will be a niche like
horses and of course you know that's
beneficial for him because that's his
business um and you know he needs to
make money so he can go send people to
Mars or something like that and that's
post responded that she wouldn't replace
a gas gers keep the classic for the
reasons combustion vehicles are better
and I said wow that's some good
engagement right there and I said you
can't carry a gallon of electricity if
you get stranded on a mountain the the
the thing being let's say you're on a
Jeep or something and you're going uh
yes I always do win my internet uh
debates I I I do okay it is a given
fact okay you know what they say facts
don't care about your feelings all right
anyway um you can't carry your gu of
electricity if you get stand stranded on
on a mountain uh the if you say you have
a Jeep and you're going offroading or
something and you run out of gas you can
always carry extra gas or something and
some many these people are trying to say
well you can carry batteries all right
fine fine um if you can if you guys can
figure out uh how to carry uh five a
gallon of gas which about five pounds
right how much does
a six lb yes all right a gallon of gas
weighs about six lb and then I'm going
to add an extra 2 lbs for the container
right so about 8
pounds if you guys can create an 8 pound
battery that can get you 20 or 30 miles
depending on the fuel efficiency of your
car or vehicle especially if you're
going
downhill um that first of all it' be
great second of all that that that
wouldn't exist and some of these people
are saying you could roll a small
generator up there sure yeah technically
technically you could bring a generator
to a car I mean sure but then you're
gonna have to power it by
something what are you going to do burn
leaves in there and it's going to have
to plug into your Tesla overnight and
you're not going to get home until
morning and yeah most generators are
powered by gas so you could have just
saved money got the gas car put it in
and you know not not gotten stuck and
then some of these people were saying
that um some of these people were saying
that cars can't like like electric cars
are just better for some reason let's
see I'm trying see the
comments where are
they the comments be
here all right sorry guys we're having
some technical difficulties standing
by where am I let's see if I
can there was some more comment too
maybe they deleted them because they got
utterly destroyed by my facts and logic
all right um but people were talking
about how they could carry batteries and
the tech was right there
and exactly right so Elijah says that he
agrees with me on this point electric
cars are great idea but we can't just
execute it well enough yeah I mean
electric cars you know they're good in
the city um they're nice but they have
various problems first of all they're
super heavy um electric cars they they
they they basically ruin the roads um
second of all electric cars they um if
you ever get stranded or something right
if you if you get stranded you can
always go down to a gas station or carry
extra gas with you you can't really do
that with batteries right electric cars
they don't
um if you get into accidents you can uh
you because of the battery they can um
get expensive repairs like 10,000
$20,000 is the price of you know a cheap
used car maybe even a cheap Tesla from
let's say 2015 let's see how much does a
Tesla from 2015 cost 205 like just base
model um so it it's just better to just
upgrade yeah you can get a Tesla the
model as for
25459 from car here in Houston um and
according to Wikipedia that's actually a
luxury car so yeah um if you were to get
an accident in an electric car it would
cost you as much as just buying a brand
well
basically new and car years a brand new
electric C also you know batteries as
you guys know with phones of course
electric car batteries are bigger
degrade over time and you can't really
like replace them like you could old
cell phones are in um new cell phones is
right now and speaking of new cell
phones as you guys know the iPhone 16 um
series just came out but now we have to
talk about the iPhone se4 which is
rolling out soon so here's what we know
about the iPhone se4 um the iPhone se4
is going to radically change um how the
SE series is so as you guys know the
iPhone SE series released in 2016 they
had some refreshes I believe in 2020 and
2022 um they basically look like the
iPhone 5 the iPhone 7 respectively right
um so the iPhone se4 is actually going
to be in the style of the iPhone 10r
which was a really really popular phone
um a few years ago like most kids had
that phone um just like how most kids
now have the iPhone uh 13 14 15 series
of phones now um so as you can see here
this is what the phone looks like it
really looks like you took an iPhone 13
mini and you have a small um camera
right there so what do you think about
this
because for some reason I don't know why
teenagers um like to take pictures with
their 05 wide angle camera um you know
stick their tongue out go like that and
then post it for some reason I don't I
honestly don't know why um as you can
see here this will be missing an ultra
wide camera um but it will be having the
Apple's first 5G modem and a 18 chip so
it's going to be faster the most phones
in its category um or maybe the pixel 8A
might be able to keep up with it and it
has
a old LED display and some people um
actually lots of people want
to well yeah that's why we have the
department of Team change and
translation anyway lots of people want I
actually like the home button um I
believe let's
see
uh lots of people actually like the home
button for their
grandfather um I think like
yeah uh yeah lots of people went there
lot people want the home button to be
like for their people or something like
that um people who or um who grew up
with the iPhone you know using the home
button they they actually like the SE
having the home button um
people um just just lots lots and lots
of people like the home button for some
reason of course I'm not a fan of
gestures I'm a fan of you know onc
screen buttons on my phone um but not
physical but you know virtual digital
buttons they can do a lot more but it
appears that the iPhone sc4 is going to
drop this um this will be a phone
probably mostly geared towards kids and
most kids aren't going to care about
that um but I'm not sure if this phone
is is is the right choice from Apple
kind of looks like they're
redistributing the iPhone 13 Parts as
you can see easily from the notch right
there which is now kind of going to be
uncool because the dynamic Island
Dynamic peel is popular so it says oh
Elijah says that his iPhone is old so I
used to have home button yeah I think I
calculated that your iPhone is an iPhone
8 or something like that
um so this is going to be kind of seen
as like the uncool phone I guess but it
is still an iPhone it still has iMessage
so you know it it it will be better it
it would be better on the teenage
hierarchy of smartphones right which
would be
essentially uh 16 pro pro Max
whatever that's number one and then you
kind of like scroll down the list AIO
down to maybe like 13 maybe 12 12 might
be able to make it in because it has the
vertical camera alignment um so that's
that that's cool now I guess because 12
and 16 um of course the camera control
button I guess it's going to figure out
a way to use that for Tik Tok or
something and then you'll get the iPhone
se4 and then it will drop but in
features it will rise so after the C4
you might have like Samsung phones but
like good Samsung phones no Samsung
people think that Samsung's like a cheap
plan so Samsung's probably gonna be at
the bottom Google Google might be yeah
so they might go to Apple and then the
se4 will be like the bottom of the Apple
but like at the top of all the other
phones then you have
Google then Samsung I guess then like
Nokia TCL or whatever it doesn't really
matter let's see
um how
was your sister has an iPhone with face
recogniz and and you look similar
you're not like you're not even
twins
it well if I was a sister I turn Face
recent off see this is why I don't use
face recordcent okay I use a like long
typy like quy password to get in and
then I use the fingerprint sensor to get
into like secure folder with Samsung
secure folder right I always wanted
fingerprint s on my phone so that um I
could like scan fingerprints and see if
they could matching the databases
unfortunately there are no applications
for that well technically there are apps
for that but you have to have an
external fingerprint scanner so it
doesn't work with the finger scan on
your phone yeah yeah yeah I know I know
like she's not you're not even twins I
was sister I turned that off IM
immediately so um hopefully she's
watching right now so yeah that's that
that is why I use a long password
because then it can't be like forced out
of me or something like that all
right but Samsung on the Samsung end
over here the much better and Superior
brand and I praised what's your name
Sydney Sydney Sweeny for doing America a
favor by promoting Samsung and using a
Galaxy Z FP 5 but then also slam for not
you know she I I don't know why she's
popular um she hasn't really done
anything for America except for you know
Samsung I also claimed that the 20th
Amendment should be you know support for
Samsung I don't know um anyway
speaking of Samsung the Samsung Galaxy
Tab S10 has released and there is
actually no tab
S10 very conven want to pick music in
the car sure sure pick music in the car
and then like cash at money well okay
that's a problem that's a problem see
she should change your
password okay like she's just begging to
get wait what's wrong with your phone
why can't you pick music in the car of
your phone I mean I know Bluetooth
Bluetooth exists on the iPhone 8 anyway
um back to the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10
here's what it means for the Galaxy s26
because s25 is already been made it's
coming out soon what do you notice on
the screen and for those of you who want
tab experts you notice that there's
actually no tab S10 there's still a plus
but there's no 10 which I could go on
and on about naming conventions like how
you how you know iPhone skipped the nine
they skipped
one right so I You could argue that you
can't have a tab S10 plus if there's no
10 because it's plus
nothing but I'm not the marketing team
whatever this means that people are not
really wanting
smaller well
disconnect good grief anyway um people
are not wanting smaller tablets I guess
are these smaller good tablets I mean un
producer Samsung would be very happy to
sell their A8 and I'd be very happy to
not use their A8 um but see the display
and just we have 14.6 and 12.4 and
people are not really wanting maybe the
smaller Flagship phones the 6.2 inch to
to s24 s25 and they'll just NX it for
the s26 series um which makes sense
they've been steadily getting rid of
their bezels the s204 plus is actually
about the same size as the Galaxy
regular s20 so uh with with a larger
screen so if Samsung's able to do that
then I hope that's
good yeah I I I hope they can do that
because I believe that a biger phones
are better but I think they might be
losing out on the market and I think
Asus and maybe Apple might come back in
and start selling mini phones I believe
the se4 would technically be considered
a mini phone people are really going to
like it um but let's look at the Galaxy
Tab S10 series of course you have Galaxy
AI on here hopefully they don't make you
pay extra for it it's going to this it
might end by the end of 2025 I hope they
don't do that um but all the sad thing
is the ultra is Wi-Fi only there is no
SIM card connectivity in the tab Ultra
if you want Sim you have to get the
Galaxy Tab S10 plus where you can get
Wi-Fi and you can get it on data um but
it is smaller and has the regular screen
as well and it also has s pin charging
as well as s 10 Ultra and these price I
mean they're pretty good comparable um
16 GB of RAM a terabyte it's actually
interesting that you can upgrade the RAM
i' like to see some Luma fusing scores
on here what you can do um with this
tablet Al compared to iPhone Pros also
iPad proos sorry also you can see
that the it still stays that Wi-Fi I
don't know why they do that basically
forces you to get a phone I guess but if
you're paying this much for a tablet you
probably have a phone might even have a
laptop already um this might just be a
drawing tablet as well unfortunately the
keyboard is not with it but got let's
look at the specs let's look at what we
have here so it's running Android here
we have a
wqxga plus display 14.6 inches of course
we have the notch here not for face
recognition but for better um
video calling and stuff like this it's
really sad that Samsung didn't really
have an event to announce this us to
have events for stuff like this as well
um you have basic cameras hours of video
play time which is I am still glad that
they still have the micro SD card slot
up to 1.5 tabes I think I used to be two
maybe that was on a phone or something
like that but I'm glad that they still
have this also have GPS for I guess
maybe you can use as a really big
console for your display now let's go
over to cheaper things over in the
mobile world the Galaxy s24 Fe which is
basically spare parts from Samsung has
also been released um probably like the
iPhone 13
se4 is basically a rehashing of the
iPhone 10r and 13 combined but here's
the s24 Fe um let's let's look at this
so of course we got Galaxy AI has the
same stuff um you can unlodge objects
move and move and auto fil I wish autofi
was a little bit better it still does
better than Google um photos does in my
opinion all right you can turn sketches
into works of art um that's actually
pretty smart pretty pretty smart Okay um
of course you got Circle sear live
translate interpreter browsing assist
great features getting upgraded all
across the board all the way to the s22
plus Series so um those aren't going to
be you know needed upgrades um if you
have that but I would upgrade if you
have better if you want better battery
or something like that of course you got
quick show I am glad to see Samsung
finally um showing off some of these
features as well um Samsung doesn't do a
good job of showing off their undercover
features talking about good luck and
stuff like that like that's my job I
guess for to tell you guys about it by
wish Samsung would do this um more
especially as they tend to remove
features like micro SD card slots
headphon Jacks from their phones they
need to differentiate themselves away
from Apple um which I guess Quick Share
I TR to be like hey guys we have air
drop too but I do like how they're still
showing buttons on here um also they
launched with the watch Fe as well um of
course Galaxy fitness health so it has
new AI features um of course what do you
guys think about these colors we have um
like kind of a grayish color which is
what the titanium on the s24 ultra would
look like um I I assume I haven't been
down to the Samsung so to test this out
yet um of course we got black which
makes sense and then we have kind of a
green and then we have kind of a blue I
think that for the F kind of a fun model
like kind of a flagship kind of looks
like a flagship but it's only $649 of
course you find better deals elsewhere
it's brand new right the kind of like
budge is phone kind of like the a 70
series that they kind of Ned but you
know finding his decks or something like
that I I would think they might have
some more fun colors because like I
guess people who want expensive stuff
don't like color I don't know why like
Samsung's only fun color from the s24
that they sold on carriers was an atosis
yellow like they black I think but they
didn't have black in my storage and RAM
capacity uh titanium and yellow for some
reason
which yeah whatever um but I would think
they may maybe want to have a red or a
pink or maybe a brighter green but
Samsung seems a bit understated here
these are nice colors um especially
people might be upgrading I had a green
s22 plus it was a nice color terrible
battery though U I also had a black
a715g so uh but it was glasstic so it
kind of had like a the orlow Shimmer um
from the like Note 10 days 2019 um fun
fact I actually predicted that the Note
10 was going to get three years of
software updates um oh he says he likes
the greenish one yeah yeah I like green
if I was going to get this phone I might
get black cuz uh it I I like that color
uh green maybe maybe blue um these
colors are nice like they're not
controversial or anything like that but
I wish maybe Samsung would have gone a
bit more bold um like let's look at the
iPhone se4 like this this white is a bit
more bright or something like this but
it feels that the s24 is a bit matte um
which is okay but um I'm not really one
to care about colors or stuff that as
well um so we have a 10 megapixel selfie
camera that's should be good um 50
megapixel wide angle Camera 12 megapixel
ultra white camera 8 megapixel telephoto
camera I want to congratulate Samsung
for um being able to count I'm glad that
they're not like one two three four five
six guys we have six cameras on here
because you know just one can zoom no
okay apple apple went on Apple was
trying to go on and on and tell us that
the two camera iPhone was actually a 4
cam iPhone no okay this is a proper
three camera setup um the zoom s it only
8 megapixels but it's three times so
that's good um I may I wish they might
be able to do this for say maybe a flip
series for $649 instead of $1,000 which
still th000 pocket Mir there and of
course we have the other features here
we got instant slowmo portrait studio
which actually looks good even though
Sydney Sweeney kind of like acted about
it speaking of
this bro she kind of looks like Ali
Stucky I don't know
um then we have have night
portrait yeah sure that that's not
happening I what the heck is a I I
should have this on my phone I have this
on my phone let's see what chat says
let's see what chat
says oh you're
behind oh oh well oh oh dear um Pro
visual engine so um I don't know I don't
know if this will get used but I'm glad
it exists it's always better to have a
feature than not have it what else do we
have here Optical qu
Zoom wait
what is this are you trying to tell me
that your Zoom is just AI enhanced
with okay that that's just mean AI hand
Zoom so it's not actual optical zoom for
some reason it says it's a three times
Optical right yeah so I guess once it
goes past that they used to call it
hybrid Zoom they said night portrait
well they might work I'm just not sure
if it's going to get used a lot um
cuz we you you have a phone from like
2017 so the tech has advanced in the
seven years that it's um caught up with
all right um hyper realistic gaming
experience I honestly want to know what
games they're playing on here it does
have an xnos 2,400 e um battery 4,700
milliamp that's actually pretty good um
especially a phone of this size um these
stats are usess listen up to 81 hours no
one's going to listen to music 81 hours
straight
um without you know anything also these
stats are based on if your phone is for
some reason not connected to a network
so you know if you're just using your
phone as an iPod uh
sure um of course we got the application
that they think will be most used to I
don't know who designed this graphic we
got Tik Tok we got some game music music
some game social Maps um dive into most
of viewing experience
120 Herz display 1,000 n
PE what's wrong with you people why
would you C it at 1,900 just do
2,000 I mean come on I noticed your
spare parts phone but good grief um
aluminum frame Gass victus plus so
should be able to with stand the drop
have Smart twitch quick set up sure and
your privacy secured so let's actually
go back up to this graphic here and
let's look at the applications here Tik
Tok some game you have Samsung Music
which like I'm probably the only person
who uses it and another game social
media no map social media and streaming
maybe I'm watching a video um and that's
going to lead us into our next segment
which is have smartphones lost their
original purpose and I'm still doing
some research for this I'm going to do
like a long in-depth article maybe on it
over at the tech boy.org but as you guys
know um crackberry.com or or or
something like that is a website that
was about Blackberry until you know
Blackberry went to fun and they stopped
making phones anymore and then TCL
picked it up and they stopped making
their phones so now this is basically a
general General tech review website they
kind of go into some of the keyboard
phones like the uni hoods Titan uh you
guys can go check it out
um I I I went back because they will go
back far back at least past 2007 and
they were reviewing some Windows mobile
phones um let's see if I can pull up the
article here
um crackberry windows
and um I was reading some uh uh some GSM
Arena and they were talking about
Symbian Symbian phones I was looking
into that too um and I was thinking have
smartphones lost their original purpose
right because you go back to 2007 you go
back to some of these articles maybe in
2010 um and actually I guess can pull up
the article here um smartphones you know
original purpose of course calling and
texting right and one of the things I am
reading if you read like some of the
dumb phone subreddits and stuff like
that that if you get a flip phone in
2024 and I assume it's the same in 20
2007 right that group chats do not work
well on flip phones or dumb phones and
stuff like that so actually um just some
of the things that we I guess take for
granted with smartphones today which is
good messaging is actually a key
smartphone feature um so that's good but
when you look at smartphones here today
of course you know Tik Tok stuff like
that didn't exist so you're not going to
really hear about anything for like
social media which I think it's kind of
dumb to buy a phone for social media
unless of course you're like an
influencer and that's your job um what
it would then you'd be con uh what's it
called creating content and that you
know consuming it right I mean the the
way that people are trying to Brand it
is like hey guys we got this 120 HZ
display screen you can swipe Tik toks
faster like I mean the phone cost $1,000
doll you can swipe Tik Tok on a $200
phone so I mean what's the difference
between a $200 phone now and it's you
know a $1,000 phone of than like build
materials and camera quality you know
just little speed increase but when they
were using smartphones back then I mean
this is what they have here people talk
about updating websites building blogs
um stuff like this I mean you have a
full qud keyboard which is also another
blessing or benefit of the uh smartphone
uh Revolution but it seems like in most
smartphone reviews on now I'm saying
that smartphones are just you know kind
of like being portals to the online
world when here of course the Internet
isn't as fast um of course data plans
cost a lot more money and you have lot a
lot less on your on your plan um they
focus on a lot more offline stuff like
programming and stuff like you're like
here is the and you can do some of this
stuff
on most all of the stuff on your
hundreds time more powerful phone right
but it's not as pushed as you like
sinking with the computer was a key
feature in some of these phones now we
just we don't really kind of like plug
in and shink anymore so let's look at
here we have push to talk which is a
network thing that's gone out of fashion
for some reason I don't know why then we
got Blackberry Messenger um Event Viewer
it's a Windows Phone Google Maps help T
yeah you account do mail notes tools
stuff like that I guess we don't really
focus on that more it's more about
talking about like the screen quality
and speed for Instagram and I guess
Snapchat and stuff like that um and then
of course I talk about creating Word
documents and Excel and stuff like that
and we can do that on our phones now but
it seems like people aren't really
focusing on that so I really like to
maybe do a poll to see what people are
doing um on their phones and what they
what the reasons are for upgrading and
how they've kind of changed um in in in
the future I was reading an article from
GSM Marina um yesterday it was from 2010
and they were comparing this Symbian
phone uh Nokia
53,000 5,300 something Express music um
which is kind like a narrow phone
touchcreen versus the Galaxy Tab sorry
Galaxy S2 and they like the Symbian kind
of more of a phone thing it's more open
I guess um it doesn't have as many apps
and the S2 is more for like consuming
content watching videos stuff like that
of course streaming really wasn't a
thing on phones back then but I guess
you know downloading the videos
themselves and I'm really wondering what
H how smartphone use has changed Also
let's go back to like 2014 or 15 right
the 20 uh
the the iPhone 6s right I mean you Che
an iPhone 6s now you can put the same
apps on it right might be missing a
security update or something but it
probably won't get hacked um it it would
be used the same you give a 6S or a 13
to someone it'll be used the exact same
so I hope we can find more applications
more uses for smartphones and it seems
that they uses changed from more um
creating content like you know word
excel um even BlackBerry Messenger
um
to kind of like consuming content which
will kind of stop the glow of
smartphones today because smartphones
today like you don't really need that
much pressing power to run Tik Tok
Instagram so they're not going to need
to focus on that as much it just seems
like it's either that or gaming
um and things to come speaking of um
there are some studies showing that um
and I know this probably from like the
antiphone people I guess I'm not sure
but like there's some studies or news
articles showing that teenagers are
getting
uh thous hundreds of um
notifications and by notifications it
like from actual people not like emails
from that like Outlook app that everyone
seems to have um a day of in like group
chats or Snapchat and Instagram and
stuff like
that
um I'd like to know
how like like please tell me how okay
if people let's say people under the age
of I don't know 20 so you know not not
not Brands
not not um not
Brands
not
other like like people I'm working with
like so a lot people are sending devices
to test and review not comments on
articles or stuff like that so you know
not not
the 18 to 25 25 to 30 people who who are
reading my website but they are actual
people how is someone talking to you 20
30 times a day okay um if I were to go
through my notification history which
you can turn on on good luck I would get
like one one notification of someone uh
my age doing that what are you kids
doing like I actually want to know I i'
like to see a study study on this I I'd
really like to see a study on this who
like kids are like always like in group
chats
how do you have that many people like
the I am in like one group chat and
there's four text messages in it so
we're not really going to count
that
um how are you in that many group chats
and iMessage and stuff like that I I I'm
really shocked so um if anyone's
listening please put that in the
comments and we'll we'll go over that
and read them in the next podcast
episode all right but here was something
that I do know
about yeah honestly I I I always want to
know what they're doing like how how how
do you have that many people who are uh
group group chatting you at at the same
time like what what what did you have to
do anyway we're going to show here on
the screen um the battle play Supremacy
I reviewed these two games Sky Warriors
versus Metal Storm at both full settings
um so 60 120 frames yeah exactly exactly
I'm like where are these kids
where that's what I'm
wondering like what are you what what
are you doing like my email app would
buzz me more
than like any app on the phone and it's
kind of sad but you know at least I get
free devices sent to me no one else can
say that all right but here we go the
battle for suemy SkyWars versus Metal
Storm this is a image of uh skyw
Warriors I think yeah so I did some
reviewing here on the s24 ult in gaming
mode Samsung gaming mode and this is
actually our most popular article so uh
I guess the people are asking for more
reviews like this so we'll give them
this but there's a lot to be gleamed in
the screenshot um here um sorry for the
low quality here but in this game you
can go faster um at times and this is
how you control there and you have a
radar here and this is some of the
screenshots here I really want you to go
read this article but um the gaming in
metal stor I say the controls are better
isn't that an epic screenshot right they
you have a radar um the the controls are
more free as you can see there's no like
joystick or anything like that so the
terrain is more interesting but you
can't go as fast and this is allowable
in 120 um frames per second what the
heck is St Fox because this isn't a
gaming thing I just wanted
to what what Star Fox isn't that like an
educational website like Starfall or
something like that um anyway so yeah so
make sure you to check out that article
it's our most popular article of the uh
of the week okay we talked about 5G
Battle of the voices hopefully Alexa and
ke for kids radio can fix what they're
doing because um I want to hear ke for
kids radio
on it uh on on Alexa all right we have
lots of videos to get into today um Mr
the boss released a new video about
social media algorithms controlling
people and honestly it's just a whole
bunch
of yeah I think all right Star Fox is an
all Nintendo game it's practically a
dead franchise
interesting like is it on a switch or
something uh here is M D's the boss as
he puts it in
and we are only 30 no oh wow M's boss
actually put out two new videos ronard
mbappe Will Smith Kim Kardashian
apparently these are all celebrities and
he tested out their technology products
all right um I guess we're gonna have to
watch that as well
but wait I have to share this on the
screen there you
go all right hope can you see this yes
you can all right we have our social
media video thing here um you know what
I'll basically summarize it he says
these algorithms are smart and people
can't control themselves w w also half
apps have on social media X is not a
social media platform anymore it's like
a micro blogging blogging platform
that's news app um YouTube obviously is
in social media Snapchat is uh Advanced
camera application of chatting features
and filters and Reddit is not a social
media application so one two three four
h more than half but let's get into this
cuz I think it's going to be interesting
to see kind of the celebrity Tech
products like already eviscerated
there's a
smart and I hate to tell you um I
already eviscerated Patriot mobile
Patriot mobile people the uh the the the
uh what do you call them carriers for
patriotic Americans um you know the
freedom speeds plan for being $22 so
it's going to be even more fun to
eviscerate these other terrible Tech
products as well let's see what the SNES
says uh in oh so it's a really old game
w w LOL all right um yeah so patreon
mobile but I forgot I actually think the
one that's popular now is pure talk so
we're actually going to check them out
see if Pure Talk is legitimate or if
it's you know trying to scam you or not
scam because you know actually provides
it but overprice overprice and of course
then if they offer me a sponsorship of
course I will say yes just kidding but
anyway let's get into celebrity Tech
products hopefully you guys can hear
this on the screen switch Cameo oh yeah
that's an ad um some of those ads are
annoying you've been overpaying for
years don't all right here in front of
me right now are the tech products made
by the world also some of these products
are old like that watch we was using
biggest celebrities everything from
smart watches look at this watch do not
look old also speaking of smart watches
Samsung used to put cameras on a
smartwatch why did they stop that there
was such an ad that people were whining
about because uh he was taking uh he he
was he was trying to like show off the
features and he was taking pictures
while skiing and they were they were
people were whining about that because
people like to whine and whining is a
Pastime um but at least Samsung was
being
Innovative I mean now they wouldn't put
a cam watch on cam under watch which is
sad I mean if I want a cam under watch I
have to buy like a spy toy from like
2013 or I have to buy uh some 2.8 in
watch from
AliExpress that replace your smartphone
to microphones that make you sing better
to Cyclone powered popcorn that sounds
nice a microphone that makes you sing
better machines so have the celebrities
use their special talents to make
something genuinely amazing or have they
actually just abused their Fame to sell
you a load of hot garbage time to find
out with our lovely homemade ratings
chart and let's actually go in order of
how famous the person is
Let's uh let's see let's let's keep a
ranking of if I've ever heard of these
people and know who they are and what
they've ever done um Elijah says he
can't sing at
all what they've ever done um I've
actually been able to kind of
extrapolate what people have ever done
like I I am good at talking off the
teleprompter which is which is a good
skill okay these episodes aren't
scripted um I mean I have notes but
whatever anyway um I'm I'm good at
talking over tele promptu cuz you know
there's no teleprompter right now I'm
also good at like guessing stuff so you
know I can kind of like guess what they
did um also what what the heck who's
this
guy let's keep a let's keep a tally of I
am who already has a very respectable
will I am so the only reason I know who
this guy is never heard of him the only
reason I know who this guy is is because
of his Tech Elijah says be right back
okay because because of his Tech
products that he's released from
multiple times but I mean this guy this
guy could literally be I don't know
attorney
general well I know who the Attorney
General is but he could be he could be
someone famous and I I wouldn't know
okay I I I could see him walking down
the street and be like I wouldn't notice
him 1.6 million Instagram followers and
he has made a smartwatch called the dial
holy cow this packaging is amazing only
$70 that's actually a pretty good price
now I believe this smart watchat came
out 10 years ago
so I don't think he can buy it now he
probably got this off of eBay it looks
like a floor standing the price might be
different and here is the
watch reminds me of the Samsung Galaxy
S original Samsung Galaxy Gear watches
um you have a really tight band here you
got the camera um kind of looks like a
VTEC watch those VTEC watches are great
I play with those things until the
screen came off does it look like a
handcuff now the key selling point here
is that this thing has full smartphone
functionality and it runs on a voice
activated
oper it's got such a strong magnet it
just ripped off my arm it what are these
are these watches or handcuffs runs off
a voice activated operating system
called Anita like I neita unfortunately
I need a network connection to help you
first name Anita second name connection
yeah that's crazy interface is fine
enough I me it gives me like 2014 style
you know inter faces I guess it looks
somewhat slick and like a smart I would
really call it slick but true also you
know it's missing cameras I it has a
selfie camera Like the Kitty watches
though but at least the kitty in watches
actually had back cameras as well I mean
they were 3 megapixels but they but it's
pretty clear the core functionality
rests on it communicating with some sort
of server that I am pretty certain the
dude's just taken down to be fair which
is ridiculous I mean I wouldn't want my
phone to be running only to work on a
server and basically how phones working
now today like most people couldn't use
a phone let's say you only have let's
say you're on Patriot Mobile's uh
freedom of speech plan $22 a month you
got unlimited talking text no data right
you can make calls text um what else can
you do actually did you guys know
Snapchat actually works offline of
course not the chatting features but the
filters and pictures and stuff like that
um you can download some offline AI
models I forgot to talk about that last
episode which was terrible
um you can draw of course you can't
transform your drawing and you can
generate some images on your phone if
it's powerful enough the quality isn't
terrible for a watch camera it's just
the colors need some work good to me I'm
honestly not surprised it barely works
to be honest it looks like it doesn't
even listen to Will I Am himself let's
talk about
music who would hope they watch like
that anyway like you know for well that
this guy and this is what this what the
problem that all the Samsung people have
except for Sydney Sweeney apparently all
all the Samsung influencers celebrity
people I remember one time back in 2018
this Samsung celebrity influencer person
was writing something good about the
Samsung and it said tweeted from my
iPhone like this this is the problem you
know full well that this guy as soon as
he gets out of the cameras or something
is not using that thing as its
phone no he has an iPhone 6 or whatever
right all these people are running
around here with iPhones and they're
taking millions of dollars from Samsung
Apple gave me millions of dollars I'd
probably use their
phone what creating a voice over with AI
be a real Mission most of the voices
sound
pretty but before we decide how low will
he go on our beautiful scoreboard we've
got two more products from the guy oh
wow so he's he's like
A's he's great at Tech apparently first
the super mask designed I guess to be
the Batman utility belt of also $347 for
a
mask this this like a coof mask because
Dyson sold a coof mask that that one
actually looks neat this looks kind of
like an alien head face masks okay so
it's got a silicon seal that goes over
your nose it's got LED who on Earth is
going to pay $347 for a face
mask is it at least
n95 lights on the outside two
three-speed ventilation fans and noise
cancelling bluetooth earbuds that
magnetically dock onto the mask when not
okay okay okay use so broadcast your ear
wax to the wait how are you supposed to
watch this thing too like if you have
Co is this
like can can you remove this cuz I mean
you wouldn't want to carry all those Co
germs around you and reinfect the
country people sitting on either side of
you there's a slightly bigger problem
here this mask is on its tightest
setting right now the
one okay maybe this is for people with
big heads products where it's absolutely
vital that you create a complete seal
and yet there were two different sizes
there was small medium and then medium
large but between those two options I'm
firmly in the camp of medium large
Joseph can I just check I'm not being an
idiot here of course so that's the
tightest possible setting yes see if it
fits
you
no that's terrible
how how what what are you supposed to do
in the nicest way possible how large
would you say your head is uh all my
loved ones in my entire life I said I've
got a fat head I always go for the extra
large and the minimal padding in helmets
if you wore the straps higher up then
does it fit no cuz then you got a
massive Gap here how do they make a face
mask that I mean you can get a face mask
out of a box for free that will fit
better doesn't mask your face and
starting to get the feeling that
everyone's favorite pandemic doctor will
I am doesn't completely think things
through and finally we've got his
earphones called the
buttons the buttons it's like me naming
a cell
phone the screen the the the the
buttons buttons is the name of a teddy
boo which unlike basically every single
other set of earphones that do
everything they can to hide themselves
these are designed to like the buttons
on your clothing specifically be on show
they meant yeah that's a great way to
get robbed or laughed at because you
bought from this apparent scammer must
be the way for you to show the world you
love music by looking a lot like vinyl
records
also I'm pretty sure I could take any
earbuds I mean I got these earbuds for
free of our airplane okay I'm pretty
sure I can take that I have a quarter
right here hey guys I'm about to do an
art project get a hot glue
gun all right guys we have our uh earbud
free $1 a quarter hey guys these are the
buttons that that makes zero sense all
right which also happened to snap
together with
magnets yeah um my $18 only why do birds
do that for free well dude what is it
with this guy and the insistence on
showing people the insides of your ears
so will I am is was the sound quality
any good like would he listen to these
himself if he was making or singing a
song probably not because
probably not so BR I am he gave him a
three look this guy made a face mask
that did
nothing okay I'll probably still be on
this guy made a face mask that did
nothing he made a phone that doesn't
work in 10 years um the phone that
barely worked when it was around 10
years ago in earbuds okay so that is one
out of three working products and the
other two fa horribly absolutely
horribly
that's at least a
one I'm gonna give you a three mostly
the effort an eff true oh wow this this
one looks a lot more tea pain all right
so we're back here I've never heard of
this guy ever in my life like he I mean
who can't T Pain what does he even do
see a wrestle more budget than I was
expecting it to this is the IMT pain
microphone I guess he's a singer it's oh
it's packaged in that horrible sharp
plastic I guess it reminds me of like
some Halloween prop packaging or
something like that it doesn't look like
it's worth $56 I'm not really one to
care about packaging but still you can
really feel with te but this is actually
a pretty cool product idea because it
looks like it's $10 I mean I I had a
microphone from Target that was bigger
and cost like $5 even if you have no
idea who Tain is I think there's a
pretty good chance that you heard Tain
voice at some point it is yeah that
chance is non I've never seen this guy
he was in movies or something famously
autotuned like so autotune but I have no
idea what he sounds like without the
[Music]
autotunes and so
this got me doing the dishes yep
neverhood there's a guy in my can
apparently give that power to you oh God
I hate this autotune in a $50
microphone although I'm actually the
perfect candidat test this with because
I cannot sing so there's a record button
[Music]
here wait now click it records it's not
live yeah I'm pretty sure there's an
autotune app oh I just still here I'm
pretty sure there's an audio tune app
that that will do that for you for free
or for $5 a month
[Applause]
play that kind of I it does what it says
but I really did are they just buy this
for the name elah have you ever heard of
this guy
teain okay interesting it's time sure to
whip it out what I'm actually really
upset that you're going to hear my
before singing as well as my after we've
known each other for so long this a big
moment right here play we've known each
other for so
long I will take that that's the first
time
sh no you haven't heard of him oh okay
I've ever heard myself singing where I
don't want to run and hide myself under
my bed in silence for the next week
there's another button here which
apparently allows you to drop a dirty
background track
[Music]
what series
so known each
other for so
long all right
each
other for so long you know Al how are
you supposed to export that like if you
want to make a song it it's stuck on the
microphone and if you record it of
course it would be you know downgraded I
mean it does what it says will do so
that's a tin but is it worth $56
no I actually like it no one would ever
use this to record real music but it's a
lot of fun and then when you're done
press these two buttons pull that off
never mind it's safe still not with 56
this is a USB port so you can download
to your computer also that would
actually be a secret way to transfer
files because I'm pretty sure you can
upload them to the USB as
well maybe you can put like mware on it
then that would be really useful I kind
of sneak in a microphone and hack into
the computers the files of you singing
so this is the trailer for The Product
hey KN off that racket I will turn this
car
around everything how old is this
sounds better with the p
m I'm sorry
what so all the visitors of this YouTube
channel I'm really sorry that you had to
endure
that
thing
um hey still noise one button pain
effect I am pain and I approve this
me you're not running for president so
it's not just for performances this is
also a child discipline tool T you could
smack someone in the head with did I get
what's a simply piano is I like a
YouTube channel is marketing genius so
Mr TP I mean the commercial
not a professional piece of equipment
but does a five you gave this guy here
who literally sold a broken phone a
broken
uh something else broken face mask that
didn't even cover your face it fell off
your face a three you give this guy who
made an overpriced working product of
quin's commercials of five I mean what's
gonna have What's it gonna take to have
a 10
like a signed copy of a of an actual
working computer by like the Prime
Minister of England what it says on the
10 which is more than we can say for
some five out of 10 all the way up at
7.1 million Instagram followers now oh
Nando
Alo alno never heard of this guy let's
see if we can figure out what he did
also um if we keeping score it's one two
it's an app with cringy ads that
basically all of us CL classical
musicians make fun of why is it that uh
piano tiles
game we've got Fernando Alonso is he is
he a famous scooter person or something
depending on what you're in also um side
note here would you name your child
scooter totally not related to any Ideo
drama at all who is either going to be a
massive deal or you have no idea who I'm
talking about alono is a Spanish Formula
1 World Champion current oh wow driving
for Aston Martin but I love how he's put
carting world champion before F1 in his
bio guy's got his priorities straight
and so what he's done is built a
Lifestyle brand called kimoa off the
back of his racing career and in what
might be the most fitting product for a
formula one so this is an actual product
to's see if it works you know where
snobs don't I question all of you people
all right ring driver to make this is
their version of an e scooter how hard
could it make be to make an e scooter I
saw a scooter ebike online for $200 I
mean think about it e Scooter's barely
regulated okay they're like it's just a
battery on Wheels okay it can't be that
hard to make an e scooter Hima we
believe that life perseveres within
regardless of what occurs externally
this is why we love the Sun the Sea and
the light because they reflect a way who
wrote This
what I half expect to see unb
moment what being just as the sun Rises
internally each
day who wrote
that okay this is GNA get edited I'm got
to clip this tell me you've used chat
gbt without telling me you've used chat
gbt well you could have called someone
else like I think we all know someone
else who could have written that
sentence doesn't exactly scream unique
products that have had lots of love put
into them though yeah Elijah yes true
that's not what I was thinking you know
um but yeah maybe
maybe I do have an idea of where we can
test this we'll get to it oh this one's
fun so for some baffling reason
soundcloud's Golden Boy rapper soldja
boy you know this guy started selling
his own video game consoles in 2018 and
wait what
did the scooter
work oh this one's fun so for have an
idea of where we can test this we'll get
to it oh oh he hasn't tested it yet I
was like dang like crass or something oh
this one's fun so for some baffling
reason soundcloud's Golden Boy ra
SoundCloud
SoundCloud the app so boy you know this
guy also what is with these people he
can't spell s o u l j
a because you know the what happened to
the G
started selling his own video game
consoles in 2018 and the Pinnacle of
them released in 2021 was supposed to be
the soldier boy game get it I think
these are the cheapest feeling earphones
I've ever hel I remember the guy's
Twitter marketing at the time this thing
wasn't just being sold as a knockoff
Game Boy it was advertised with a 3.5 in
touchcreen Netflix Spotify and apple
music that sounds like a bad
smartphone right out the box and it was
supposedly going to have some huge big
brand big budget games including
fortnite and Call of Duty yeah
fortnite's not a big brand game okay
guys guys you can get fortnite on any
Android
phone what you don't like consoles also
I think we're two of two on here because
I've heard of soldier boy also I would
have spelled his name correctly because
you know I can spell but apparently
there's a J in his name long story short
it became pretty clear that the legend
soldja boy game was actually just an
existing gaming handheld called the wait
what is this pretty clear why do you
have the Direct
TV bounce logo in the background of your
Instagram ad the legendary soldja boy
game was actually just an existing
gaming handheld called the trdr pocket
but in red and wow in red in
red you don't like crappy offbrand
consoles yeah I wish there were more
consoles um I don't game but have more
competition
um also what do you think about
handhelds like I was thinking like after
the switch all the handhelds are like
now seven in big now like now like this
handle is only three and a half inches
like you hold it you can put it in your
pocket you can't put a switch in your
pocket after it turned out that it was a
scam and basically no one who bought one
seemed to receive one Soulja Boy then
started promising those buyers that they
would instead get an upgraded model with
AI that was now worth
$400 wow AI
on a game console and this is that oh
God this thing is so reflective this REM
mind this would have been good you know
this been a great console greatest of
all time in
2006 not a good choice to finish for a
gaming console so it runs Android which
means so yeah you just bought a trash
phone oh no the Call of Duty and
fortnite games he's promised to people
they're just the mobile games aren't
they it doesn't even meet the minimum
requirements to run
fortnite yep I knew it I knew it it's an
offbrand
trash Android phone that's been forcing
some weird aspect
ratio but I mean technically the product
works fortnite on a phone does not have
very high minimum requirements uh it
plays the emulator okay it's not like
the best visual or frame what game is
that supposed to be I I'm pretty sure
that looks like it was red in Python
rate experience but it's it's not bad as
an emulator the thing has no shoulder
buttons how am I meant to drift without
shoulder buttons okay forget that let's
test the AI the supposedly life changing
AI That's the sole reason this thing's
price was increased life changing in in
in in a box bad Mario I don't know yeah
the size of consoles what are you
talking about they had pocket consoles
like the Game Boy in 1989 I I'm pretty
sure they could figure out how to get uh
consoles smaller and pocketable from 200
to $400 hi Scarlet what's the
weather tell me anything tell me
anything useful crash maybe I can ask
Scarlet W get to drift for me in racing
game since I have no shoulder buttons
this whole thing is just absolutely
terrible every angle of this sucks
what if someone showed this to me why is
he why are you giving me a piece of
with okay it's Android 11 so it's 4
years out of date I have doubts about
the update schedule on this device oh
and I really love this Personal Touch
he's added to the side of the console
he's angled the power button 80 degrees
off from where it normally is why so
this guy just sold 400 out of phones
that barely work to
kids okay does it not also look like one
of those devices use in hospitals to
bring people back to life like except
this might actually be the thing that
kills me okay so this is Call of Duty
mobile all right none of the controls
work the settings oh my God the
resolution of the screen is so poor what
I can barely read the text in the menus
it's just such a lazy product they
haven't done like the base layer of
programming I could sell that if I
wanted to required to make these
controls detectable in most games well I
guess what Soulja Boy said was true in
life you either Crank That soldier boy
or he cranks you and what we're the ones
who got cranked here you get a very
prestigious zero out of 10 he gave him
zero I mean at least he delivered a
project that kind of worked let's say we
have a 4K console something what the
heck is bre through the rout I'm not
talking about a console like an Xbox or
a PlayStation I'm talking about like a
handheld well is breath through wild
like what is
it not even on the
board no everybody cares about quality
some people just want crap if that's you
the spoke post is not for
you okay we are in the tens of millions
at this point tens of millions probably
never ever heard of them in my life I
think it's pretty fair to say that
anyone Beyond this point is like world
famous well world famous probably never
ever heard of them in my life starting
with Harry Kane who's who kind of a
football legend this guy scored that's
not football it's soccer 66 goals in his
98 International appearances making him
the highest goal scorer ever for England
and literally never heard of him
ever I'm pretty sure people in Scotland
never heard of him basically meaning
that in any given game he is more likely
to score than to not score which feels
like a wild statistic so with all his
Goodwill Kane has recently launched his
own brand of sustainable Electronics
called our Pure Planet there like a
hundred things here oh dear oh dear our
Pure planet and like the kind of Brown
cardboard you're gonna give me this oh
my goodness the pandas are dying climate
change and the the rivers are rising and
the Glaciers are melting in the polar
bills something something blah blah blah
cry cry cry so let's race it buy my
product for 100 bus from them I'm going
to pick one of them let's review the
speaker I got to say Kan the speaker
looks like a speaker I could pick up at
Marshalls for $16 website feels
completely de very much like some Eagle
eyed business person has seen some well
priced generic Tech from China they want
to these
these these look like stuff that I could
find for $20 or less wealthy westerners
but then realized they needed a name to
push it so said hey Harry can we borrow
you for a day to do a photo shoot with
them I mean every single one of these
photos is shot with Harry Kane in one of
two outfits so I'm now thinking 2hour
photo shoot Max you know what's making
me think this is it's just the fact that
these products look so let's see guys in
environmental noise cancelling active
noise
cancelling
soulless Eco guys it's
Eco I I I was looking at some phone
review and it was like uh they were
trying to pass off battery saving mode
as carbon emissions cutting
mode yeah your your phone is not cutting
the carbon emissions by not being on
power
it's not how that works also no one
cares about the carbon emissions of your
phone that's just to make you feel good
about yourself all right let's see what
Elijah has to say um bre the was I guess
it doesn't exist anymore an open world
launch title on the switch tears of
Kingdom what is even more advanced
though so that would be a better
example what tears of the
Kingdom never heard of these games in my
life all right moving on no identi claim
recycle reimagine
so they want you to throw the bo away
how how am I them or consistency Beyond
just this one logo so I guess if these
have been designed from scratch then
Harry buddy you got to get yourself a
new
designer oh no that is the epitome of
generic startup sounds yep it's like
they picked from the generic speaker
bingo in my duck speaker uh mixet sound
card this is just so lazy I can't
believe it I don't know if you're going
to get Harry how see yeah what a scam I
mean come on
they just look up a protest or something
a
protest who what are we protesting are
you protesting these trash products him
say Bluetooth mode on it would add some
value have you heard him speak I've not
seen
my
what okay so you've got one set of
speakers facing this way one on set
facing this way so you have some
directional why is it not 360 audio it
doesn't sound terrible but at the same
time I have heard $30 speakers that have
more I knew it I knew it detail this
nothing about this Tech feels at all
worth $130 I knew it I knew it was one
of those hey guys we got
uh oh okay I I knew it was one of those
environmental scam thingies you have a
famous person cry about the environment
and then scam people $100 out of it twed
I maybe I should set one of those up you
know set up a phone company um you know
how some of those phone companies like
terrible phones but then they say hey
hey we're not terrible phones because we
want to be ter because we're terrible
we're terrible because we want to be
terrible because you don't want you to
use our phone so pay extra for it um
maybe maybe I could set up one of those
terrible phone companies and then say
that I'm saving the pandas or something
you give 1% to P absolutely horrible and
then um make $900 profit maybe even sell
recyclable boxes don't even sell a
charger because Chargers are
badar I guess the only saving grace is
how much you value the sustainability
they say that every single speaker is
100% carbon neutral and 200% plastic
regenerative what wait does that mean if
you no one cares about corop neutral
whatever but that 200 % plast so that
means the 100% of plastic that intoo
turns into 200% of plastic I'm sorry I I
don't speak
this this language how can something be
200% more than what's in it I'm pretty
sure that breaks
thermodynamics but there's always an
asterisk with these things no one is
saving the planet by buying speakers if
you actually care about sustainability
buy a used one on eBay so boring product
not very good for the price you gave him
a four I mean technically it works but
if you were reviewing that in terms of
what it could do compared to it uh of
the speakers that would get a one okay I
can go down to Marshall right now well
it's say 30 something yeah I could go
down to Marshalls right now and um find
a better or comparable speaker in fact
you find like five of them for the price
of
$120 you sir have earn yourself a four
at 18 million followers
well before he got suspended and then
eventually deactivated his Instagram
account it's Kanye West all right so
we're back to someone I've heard of with
a stem play what the heck is that or I
guess yay nowadays and his stem player
speaker now we have actually covered one
of these before in one of our gadgets
videos but I think this thing is
fascinating it looks like an alien it
feels like a that does not look like an
alien hello Matt
Walsh uh yeah um I'd like to know if you
think there's an alien
yeah he he says no speaking of we got to
get to him he absolutely hor do take
again bag of skin but hidden inside is
actually an artificial intelligence that
can take any song and break it down into
its various different stems like the Bas
line drums vocals Etc allowing you
that's neat but then I'm pretty sure
phone could do that or an app to control
each one of them on the Fly power it
on it's actually such a cool looking
product so I'm a song right now and you
can see in real time stripping out the
various individual elements oh oh it's a
speaker it's a speaker I thought it was
going to like listen to a song okay so
that right there is the
drums that's the Melody I can kind of do
this on my my phone already uh that kind
of boost bace boost
stuff in fact Samsung Chang its
equalizer
settings yeah maybe you can record your
piano videos on there
it does feel just a little bit like
magic the problem though is well a it's
not a good sounding speaker considering
the price you pay for it it actually
makes Harry kanes look like good value
oh and also the only way to load music
onto it is to use the stem player
website which Pro yeah which is stupid
because a you no one has saved music
anymore okay um
B people will be playing Spotify on this
and see I'm pretty sure there's an app
for this already this is the track and
then you have to to download it and put
it onto your stem player manually pretty
much immediately relegating this to cool
toy that you probably won't use so I was
thinking a six just because of how cool
the thing is but minus one point for
trying to make his da 2 album exclusive
to the stem player effectively charging
people $200 just to listen to it that's
crazy also I've never heard a song of
his
so like I don't care now from someone
who well still has Instagram it's the
actress Drew Barrymore isn't see that
lady who was like on your knees or
something on her TV
show let's
see let me let me check here yes yes she
is all right um
okay and this lady has done a lot you
know the little girl in the ET movie
that's her host of her own talk show
that's her one of
uhhuh she's the host of her own talk
show that's her Charlie's Angels yeah
still her and now add to that list owner
of the company Beautiful by Drew who
made this popcorn
machine yeah 41 okay this looks exactly
like the popcorn machine that we have
but painted white and then has a b stuck
on
it you know full well that a popcorn
machine does not cost $41
coms yeah it wasn't uh I think someone
on Twitch he likes
a
uh who movies see like a homework movie
or
something WCS are so predictable all
right you know four oh $34 I thought it
said 41 you know fourwh popcorn machine
does not cost $34 let's see uh popcorn
machine besides part are like
three not free free but I mean you
already have one
let's see popcorn
machine uh yeah if you can find one for
$21 at
Target and if you're boycotting
Target
um you can actually find a real looking
popcorn machine for like
$50 um counter top popcorn
machine I want air good
grief uh not like
can you pop popcorn in an air
fryer here's one for
$39
$21
$17 yeah she's overpricing these popcorn
machines by 20 yeah homework okay she's
overpricing these popcorn machines by
like
$20 I got to say though not the highest
quality better K like a normal popcorn
machine most celebrity products by
default go specifically for luxury
whereas this feels quite light and who
cares about drew berrymore that much who
literally never mind but who who cares
about who that much like no no one's
going to buy a $20 extra popcorn machine
because it has a B on it okay you want
me to start selling stuff I I'll start
putting T's on stuff right here guys we
have the techboy phone it's actually
some random Chinese phone but uh I'll
put a tea on it and will be an extra
$200 cheap which is fair enough it's
only $34 but I guess I don't think you
maybe that's $ 34 UK doll maybe maybe
you have to import it cuz she's from the
US find this proudly displayed in Drew
Barrymore's kitchen as her pride and joy
so one measure of popcorn goes in there
I actually skipped dessert today so this
is kind of perfect what does popcorn
have to do with dessert popcor you
putting chocolate on it or something and
this also now apparently doubles as a
butter melting tray wow yes
please that's actually smart it's going
to use the heat though I mean that saves
the environment more than you know the
the the speaker because you know you're
saving you're saving energy or actually
using it you
know also maybe maybe it traps carbon
and carbon bad oh wow okay we're cooking
with gas oh my goodness you can see the
cyclone in action the seeds are actually
rotating and
this that's what every popcorn machine
does is actually the air fryer of
popcorn machines I guess because instead
of oil it uses cyclonic airflow
technology which is the same principle
that Dyson fans use Dyson fans are
overrated in extra money to maintain
even cooking temperature thr it's
definitely not an immediate process it
say oh wait it sounds like a jet trying
to take off wait uh Joseph this is
smoking oh
god oh yeah because it's yeah he got it
from us so it might be a bit more money
than wow you could spend your time
looking for the perfect side hustle or
you could go to printful.com printful
empowers you let's go I think we got it
working again wa why is why is the
entire thing Popp it in but I wanted
that on my popcorn not my machine all
right we're smoking up again on the
inside yeah interesting that could just
be a UK power issue but I'm going to
call it that well I got to say pretty
terrible impression of this product so
far and none of it has reached my
bow God
how do you mess up a popcorn okay still
smells good I'll give it that melted
butter oh whoa at least I melted the
butter
well and actually little top tip for
homemade popcorn he actually did put
chocolate over it so it is dessert
cinnamon butter and sugar oh not even
chocolate add some of that on top all
right
[Music]
Drew give me like
five bu more
cheers that was delicious but I take
100% of the credit that was not
delicious because of Drew Barrymore and
her cheaply made oil covered Transformer
destroying half cooking popcorn machine
Drew Barry four four I mean
okay two Barry Mo he waited will I am
way too high I can't believe you did
that sure Hillary Duff is up next
actress singer Hillary Duff
literally never heard of her ever yeah
not with the money never heard of this
woman a day in my life author and
businesswoman with 26.9 million
followers wow never heard of her so she
is officially ahead of our YouTube
channel which I'm sure she's had a big
celebration about watch out though I
might just have to build world's largest
Hillary Duff and her company below 60
has built their own Cent diffuser and I
thought this was interesting below 60
isn't referring to degrees of
temperature instead it refers to 60°
south of the Equator a Latitude that
encompasses only ocean near Antarctica
which is supposedly where the freshest
air on Earth is interesting website says
this thing redefines fragrance design
with the following wow features oh yeah
so there's a magnet on the plug and the
fragrance just snaps in place this
actually looks pretty well designed it's
probably completely overpriced but I me
it actually looks nice oh it is leaking
I mean the one job of a container is to
stop it doing and and I take back what I
said okay adjustable horizontal and
vertical plug so you
can just take this and snap it into two
different neat orientations which I have
to say is kind of a Genus idea cuz like
because the scent diffuser is kind of
thick you'll want to be able to rotate
it away from the plug next to it just so
it doesn't obstruct it and then
fragrance strength control well that's a
bit of a stretch it's got high low and
off
that was like the adventures Odyssey fan
uh off
on speed or something like that so
there's three different scents there's
if Citrus were a
feeling oh it's got like orange and lime
and Sandalwood and that sounds good to
eat unless if you want to smell it
spices mint disco on ice smells like a
spar mixed with a candy shop so
good like bubble candy vanilla buys a
time share in
Paradise
what H that's like a pina colada it's
nice pina colada is so overrated wasn't
Pina col on ey
calling okay so the scents are like
addictively good the only question on my
mind is is this actually any better than
a cheaper simpler and frankly more
aesthetically pleasing read diffuser in
theory this is meant to gently warm your
fragrances to encourage evaporation but
let's come back later to find out it
doesn't want to evaporate also this is a
terribly terrible test too how you
supposed to know what you're smelling if
you have them both in the same room who
taught you science that's true or not
Olivia Rodrigo and name oh I've heard of
her and she got yelled at on NTV but
I've heard of her yeah that's probably
the only reason I've heard of these
people anyway you probably never heard a
few years ago and now you can't stop
hearing about with 37 I don't know what
she does though was she a single didn't
she have like some concer and give all
the kids
something she gave them something I
can't remember what she gave him8
million followers has collaborated with
Sony to design her version of the link
buds which feels like a pretty off the
beaten path culture I mean that's smart
I guess cuz you know son's going to have
some good earbuds she just put purle on
it and called them Olivia
Rodrigo choice or you know Sony offered
her a bucket load of cash so this whole
purple exterior is her signature color
really I have to stop using purple but
to be very honest I don't think she's
done a very good job with it seriously I
mean you can find aods put a case on
them Olivia rrio why does Olivia Rodrigo
annoy you you don't like her singing or
something she's a singer
right maybe it was meant to look
pearlescent and like a piece of jewelry
but to me it just looks like a used
pencil oraser at least it is using
recycle materials cuz like o recycled
material I want you know earbuds that
someone else used as a water bottle
Big Dreams Big Dreams you can tell one
thing though that I think is really cool
in might go S4 ultra for the win look at
it in his hand in the hand be able to
save it is two custom sound profiles
tuned by Rodrigo and her producer for
the optimal listening yeah sure uhhuh
Rodrigo is in there herself tuning the
earbuds you think I'm GNA believe that
you think you think I'm gonna believe
that that he was back there you know I
want I want this profile no uhuh her
team did that experience of her Al guts
and sour I guess
there who named the what how is this
woman popular she named her album
guts is something really cool about
knowing that you're getting the exact
same audio experience that she's hat and
yeah her producers today she wasn't back
there fiddling with sound profiles also
I'm pretty sure I could figure out a
reverse engineer the sound profile and
make make it my own put the equalizer
settings up online if I cared enough
she endorses for her own music let's
give it a go so right now I'm listening
to her sour album without the sour sound
profile music probably try ass e the
way oh whose songs annoy you yeah didn't
see have some like satanic concert or
something like that's how I know it
from say the earphones sound pretty good
but they're a little bit Sony ear birds
I mean it's not like he was back there
making them himself got them off of
AliExpress or something they don't have
the base response that I would want and
also I think part of it is on her album
I think it's not recorded in the best
environment for optimal listening you
know there's some artists who when you
listen to their tracks on really good
earphones you just know that they've
obsessed over recording the track right
let's switch over to the sour sound
profile
okay I changed my mind it's actually
kind of lazy they both sound basically
the same as each other and they both
sound almost the same as just the flat
neutral sound profile so I guess knew it
I knew it
yeahh she wasn't she wasn't back to the
idea is cool but it's not enough to make
it a unique proposition nor is it enough
to make also I get a voice engineer that
in five minutes okay you give me those
earbuds I'll figure it out I'll figure
out the sound profile have screenshots
online and then boom who one selling
point is gone or I guess it's pink or
something purple you can find a purple
earbuds case but run over it a few times
to get some white in it yeah actually
yeah take the take a $5 purple earbud
case run over it on a scooter and then
it turns white a little bit boom it's
distressed not so great earphones sound
amazing so I would say it's not a
scandal but she's taken a pretty
mediocre product and to be honest with
this design she's actually made it
slightly worse so I think you can have a
w this is actually a really poor show is
anyone even going to reach the upper
half
$72 a month that's it that's crazy how
much are you paying for your auto
insurance I would say like now just
before we get to the top three
celebrities the ones with hundreds of
millions of followers turns out that
Will Smith is actually the global
Ambassador for insta 360 this video
sponsor and they have absolutely nailed
it with their new X4
camera okay that's I mean
sure yeah he's going to get a 10 cuz
youve they're sponsored by you and we
don't need to hear from them so SC you
never miss anything the downside is that
this often adds an extra step because
you might want to go through and tweak
which way the camera is looking at every
single point but now you don't even have
to do that anymore because blah blah
blah blah as opposed to I really like
Alon it's fun I think this is me
realizing that I really like escooters
as opposed to I really like Alonzo's
product it's pretty standard like I mean
there's a light which we've seen a lot
of very bright flashlights on this
channel this isn't really one of them
and there's just not many bells and
whistles to it ex it actually has a bell
no whistle there that one but it's got a
kick oh no Ram
R I think you can have our first ever
six I mean it does what it says it's
going to do probably overpriced it has
wood on there congratulations whoopy do
out of 10 right we're in the big leagues
now with 121 million followers that's
his first name huh It's Real Madrid
footballer Killian mbapp and he has also
released a portable speaker but this
one's looking very promising with 100
watts of Music power compared to I'd
guess the 30 watts of Harry Kane speaker
and the three watts of the speakers
inside your phone holy moly polarizing
the color on this thing slightly
hilarious attempt at branding on their
website inspired by the sporting
achievements of football star Killian
mbappe we've made a speaker I mean the
guy so you were inspired by him by a
ball into a goal so you decided to make
a
speaker okay it's a fantastic dribbler
but how did you get to speaker from
there this one is pretty exciting
because the company that manufactures it
is called L they're a luxury Speaker
Company they have a normal Bluetooth
speaker which cost 99 but then with
mbappe they've worked together to design
the pro which is
249 green is not worth
99 2.9 yeah it's not worth $150 extra
dollars that's not how this works okay
so are we being scammed or yes has
Killian gone and scored oh this is
actually super unique there's a touch
bar on the actual body of the speaker
that allows you to adjust the volume the
base and the treble although do they not
think to put a slightly brighter LED on
the inside considering you can see the
rest of the speaker from the moon so
let's take it for a
spin oh okay really feel the the thump
that comes with 100 watts of
amplification here in base is going up
now and all the way oh God uh okay so
it's nice is it worth
$300 this is a good powerful speaker but
it's exactly what it looks like you know
when you see this base slider that you
can adjust to some infinite degree it
makes you think that it's going to be
one of those speakers like the dvla
Phantom that I tested a while that can
just completely defy its Dimensions this
is not that when you dial up the base it
literally just tweaks a software setting
that adds in more base at the cost of
everything else and it sounds kind of
Muddy adjusting The Equalizer with your
music is not some sort of magic trick
that makes music sound better and that's
all this is really but you know decent
sound it's water and temperature
resistant it's got 24-hour battery life
it doubles as a power bank and well
you're not going to lose it all right go
then 6 out of 10 basically just for
doing what you say on the tin number two
then is none other than Kim Kardashian
we're now at levels of f what is she
known for like what has she ever done I
don't even understand like how does one
even start to get 361 million Instagram
followers but anyway she has worked
together with Beats by Dre to create her
how Brown that's your one thing oh guys
Brown own custom version of The Studio
Pros so she's launched this in three
colors all personally curated by
her Moon Dune that is rose gold
chocolate and Earth and dark
chocolate
I these are
scams does anyone actually care that
much about Kim Kardashian to
get brown headphones from
who what is up with Kim Kardashian and
trying to turn the entire world flesh
toned actually can't decide if I like it
or not it makes it look and feel very
premium but at the same time it makes me
feel like I'm carrying around a bag of
foundation wherever I go and then you've
also got this custom cable which weaves
together the Fabrics of all three of the
colors she's made so that
wow
that's that's something there they only
have to make one cable for all three
products let's give him a Liston I
actually haven't tested beats in a while
but these are not the products they used
to be they're actually easily the best
sounding audio products in this entire
video well that's not that hard of all
dang okay but don't get too excited
nothing's been over a six so obviously
Kim Kardashian didn't make beats but she
picked a good product to partner with
and she made it look
better she picked
brown
brown the color of do she said guys
we're going put
we're gonna make brown headphones and
I'm going to sell them for an extra
extra money and people said yes and they
bought
it some people so congratulations Kim a
seven see Lally did nothing she said hey
guys we got a brown headphones and they
were like yes idiot people are going to
buy this and then uh she gets a seven
for that okay
true you're the proud recipient of a
seven out of 10
want to charge doubly fast anchor
mag
oh whoa that is nice not subtle at all
and I love it he's doing he's tesing the
smell definitely warmed up which is just
going to accelerate the natural
evaporation process only thing that was
how on Earth are we already like halfway
through the fragrance dang probably
leaked onto the ground like when I
bought this reed diffuser this was full
to the brim with fragrance so that's
like 10 times the volume of this little
cartridge so I guess it's here for a
good time not a long time yeah I could
see this becoming a very expensive hobby
to keep fueling but she's made her own
company it's not a Rebrand of someone
else's product and it does what it says
on the tin wow impressive that deserves
a tin that better than basically any
other scent diffuser I've tried so you
can have
a so this guy gives a person who created
their own company and the product
actually works in eight and he gave Kim
Kardashian
who put made Brown headphones at 7even
okay I'm G to release the tech boy
exclusive phone it's it's an
orange Duff you want to know who we have
at the very top though it's well
arguably the most famous person on the
planet Cristiano Ronaldo who also
happens to be the co-founder and face of
consumer electronics brand rock and also
now the fastest growing YouTube channel
of all time what does this say rock is
more than my brand it's a reflection of
my mission to live life loud okay so
he's all in on this apparently and these
are his earphones and so what kind of
earphones does the most famous person on
the planet use well I hope he uses his
own earphones it'd be pretty funny if
he's actually just an airpods guy
although oh my goodness me this is
photoshopped you can very clearly see
that the earphones have been added into
the image afterwards I don't think this
is
single photo of him actually using these
this looks like a render too well that's
not a good start okay fit is secure
thanks to these fins that kind of Lodge
themselves in your ears that makes sense
he plays football he doesn't want them
to fall out while he's
running oh man oh no that's not the best
really yeah so um I think we've learned
some lessons here
today bye Jesus is the most famous
person on the planet
I don't think you would sell as terrible
earbud so um anyway um yeah so I think
what we've all learned here today we've
learned an important lesson if you're
famous don't sell
earbuds is it this is like this is the
definition of fine the thing is right
it's not expensive to make decent
sounding earphones and that is all these
are they're just very Baseline in
quality like even though these price at
like $130 $140 I'm genuinely thinking
$100 to make earphones and speaking of
earphones we go over to Pure Talk Pure
Talk P talk Pure Talk Pure Talk Express
me in Pure Talk P talk um let's um let's
see if P talk is actually worth it let's
look at the plans here
people oh
dear oh
de all right so $15 a
month just for the
months 10 gigabyt of data and a 5
gigabyte hotspot
H unlimited data for 3250 actually is
actually
$65 so um Pure
Talk customer support in the US that's
good P talk appears to um to have better
deals than Patriot mobile which is good
but still not as good as you know
anything
else Also let's look at the phone
selection okay they got Blu TCL some
ancient
iPhones okay we have some finding some
new iPhones iPhone iPhone iPhone Samsung
o we have some terrible selection here
barely anything from Motorola no Google
phones you can bring your own phone um
also the plans aren't that good I mean
there they're better but than than
Patriot mobile but I mean that's nothing
so I guess that's let me check my notes
Here I have more I wanted to get into
today but I guess that's all for now um
God bless Tech talk to you later and
right after this or maybe tomorrow
probably tomorrow sslw blogspot.com will
be coming
out oops wait we're still here it's
touch screen so you know can't yeah yeah
go bye see you</pre>
