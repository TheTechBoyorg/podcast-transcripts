<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 5424</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
the this week in the Tech booy podcast
there's so many new products that we
have in the studio to test out but first
we finally finished reviewing our
Logitech Zone true wag earbud so now or
for sale on eBay in the link below it
show up on the screen right here and
yesterday we got a brand
new new
phone and I will be telling you my first
impressions and we are also completing a
review of the obista theal mobile gaming
earphones low latency so let's get into
that with you first so I have the box
right here and for the audio quality
just listen to whatever I'm saying right
now um because that is what the earbud
quality is for um it's coming from the
mic SE the features it says has 70
millisecond latency mode for mobile um
gaming eight time hours of Play Time 32
hours of Total Play Time noise
cancelling microphone so you tell me if
that's right because there is someone
who's cutting the grass or something uh
touch controls voice control
um so you can summon Siri Google
Assistant Bixby wireless charging USBC
charging in Bluetooth 5.2 so let's go
off and see which of these claims are
valid and which ones are invalid all
right 70 millisecond latency mode for
mobile gaming totally
untr no who the heck is
this what okay um anyway 70 millisecond
latency mode for mobile gaming um let's
take that down
uh I tested it in gaming mode which you
can activate using the touch controls on
the side or you can change it using the
UA app um it's about 440 milliseconds
right that's blind from music I'm not so
sure about gaming I tried to test some
games out um to see what it does because
I don't really mobile game I tested it
with the new phone I tested it with my
Samsung phone and um it was fine I guess
uh
the sound sounded good to me now about
latency I've never played like one of
those games where you would need it no
okay either you're someone from school
or you're my mom not sure okay
um where were we oh yeah yeah so 440
millisecond latency so that that claim
is ENT okay in normal mode it's about
470 millisecond of latency hello Robert
our friend from England what time is it
over there 1 1: a.m. um yeah well we've
been doing these every week right now
we're reviewing these headphones here so
there is no 70 millisecond latency time
but it does take about 30 milliseconds
off of normal so 440 in gaming mode 470
in normal mode I did a test okay play
time of eight hours I listened
to 9900 p.m.
wow
no okay 900 P.M
uh soorry eight hours of playtime makes
sense I listen to some songs on it like
uh you know in the wild
uh the national anthem stuff like that
podcast you know wide variety of stuff
so vistion Odyssey episodes of course
and it dropped about 70% after an hour
of listening so I can say about eight
hours of listening time obviously I
can't listen to you know stuff for8
hours straight um fun fact I think this
earbud here well I got if I oh no did
you find it maybe you can use it the
tracing thing uh well this earbud here
at least the way you're seeing it well
one of the earbuds is like always 2%
lower than the other earbuds so I find
that interesting okay touch controls
they're kind of finicky but they do work
you can like change them in the app or
you can just like double tap Paws volume
up hold down to change modes or use
voice assistant though if you have voice
activation on if I had appeared to my
phone I could just say uh oh no
well I mean we are selling I could sell
these to you um about $50 if you want
them uh US Dollars um but you don't
really need that because you can just
say hey Google hey Sly hey Bixby and
will'll automatically pop up um if it's
paired to this microphone all right got
wireless charging what they mean by
wireless charging is of course the
charging case USB type-c and Bluetooth
5.2 so what do I think about these
headphones I like them I like them a lot
they're comfortable they come with
different tips in the box but I haven't
used us
them I'm sorry but I know you yep told
you it's some random kid from school's
probably trying to Pro me or something
unfortunately for
them I don't lie okay
um Bluetooth 5.2 so that's good I did
not experience many connection drops
only like one with oh wait wait we got
to come here I lost the one four years
ago so I replace G battery you know yeah
yeah so you can just like buy some new
ones cheap ones like
these um yeah so I like the sound
quality of it has its own EQ in the
application and there's also an EQ in uh
Samsung like buing the Samsung phones if
you want to use them um the sound
sounded good to me I would all like the
background sounds of you know in the
wild I heard all the gunshots and the
national amm multiple versions now no
connections and drops it's up for one
with my Samsung phone now on my new
phone I'm not so sure I don't know if
it's the headphones or the phone but I
did experience connection drops and
switching like what it go down from
here anymore what what are you yapping
about he's always been God okay anyway
um and when I tested it out on some
games like Asphalt
9 and that's it I don't really know that
many games it worked well and I played
some videos on it um yeah so highly
recommend these there's only one lie in
here and I would say 70 Mond lency time
and I was of course I'm not able to test
out the 32 hour claim but I can get this
open the case of these earbuds has a
uh lights on them so it's four lights
that means it's like half done and I've
had these since like Tuesday and it's
Saturday now uh at least in United
States so I fully believe and I this
just never charged them or anything so
came out of the box for four so battery
life is pretty good um and the audio
quality I did some like test recordings
sounds good tell me if I sound good now
um try sleeping with them
o maybe that might be a good idea but I
don't know if it might hurt my ears um
this audio quality sound good um yeah so
we'll put this up here as a test for
those but let's turn to our new phone
which just completed a battery test so
that's why it's plugged in all right and
as it's booting up let me get the box
okay this is the new B30 Pro 5G that's
right the new B30 Pro 5G so B3 Pro 5G
okay um it retails for about $2.99 so
just under
$300
and I have to say it's a pretty good
Hardware
phone pretty good Hardware so let's just
read off the specs here off the back of
the box okay we got 6.7
uh mro Mo it looked like an iPhone on
the back and then you know we got the
curved edges so Samsung right there but
I mean for $300 good good budget value
in my opinion
um go away comment there we go let's
present the screen here so you can see
the full phone and it's charging right
now the battery life is pretty good so
our standard battery test is the uh
there's this video on our YouTube
channel we mute the sound and it just
Loops it Loops full screen right so um
the keyboard phone that we got in lasted
about 7even hours on that I think my
phone might have lasted eight hours this
phone okay with it 5,000 m battery
lasted 15 hours and 36 minutes okay I
went to bed at 10 o'clock last night I
tested it put it in a drawer here woke
up and then came back at like 7 and
checked the phone it was at
43%
43%
um and then we had to download this app
on it and it told us it told us that it
was on the YouTube video until it died
for 15 hours and 36 minutes that is
impressive for 5,000 minute battery
crush the battery test so great
basically two-day battery right there
okay um cve 6.7 in AMOLED display 1080p
I like it it's a pretty good display um
Wi-Fi 6 and 12 gigs of RAM and 26 GB
memory 108 megapix main camera 8 megapix
wide angle 2 megapix macro and 32
megapix front camera you may say wow
this phone is great 108 megapixel
camera
uh I mean it is good design for a phone
that's under unit United States dollars
I'm compared to the other
phones I mean it has an actual curved
display I like the screen size minimal
bezels easy to hold in the hand actually
a glass back on a phone at this price
segment is interesting and it's charged
at 30 wats with an included charger in
the Box so thank you no but then it
falls apart uh oh it falls apart right
so the hardware it's decent the design
is a bit me I mean maybe you might fall
someone into thinking of an iPhone until
you see like the curve thatches and the
new thing back there but you can put
this uh thing thing right there and they
try to fool you with this camera here
but actually the backround camera if
it's in good light like outside it got
good pictures but inside it falls apart
is a piece of junk and that that's the
problem here the software development on
this phone is nonexistent there's only
one new branded application it's the new
mobile support application okay the 108
megapixel camera is basically useless
okay it is technically better if you
crop into something but if I take a
picture I took a picture of a stuffed
animal with it and then I take a picture
of it on normal 12.2 megapixel mode the
stuffed animal was so smudgy uh in 100 8
megapixel mode and the camera um the
light was was not as good night mode
is uh thanks and I won't skip you sorry
night mode is unusable it has this weird
banding problem where the it just you
have all these bands on the picture if
it's trying to take a night mode picture
so night mode basically useless the
macro camera falls apart indoors wide
angle it's so grainy because it's 8
megapixels and I don't know about the
CER size or anything like that right but
as for Speed and Performance pretty good
I was able to play Asphalt 9 on there
you can split screen on there it does
have its own version of The Edge screen
albe it very basic H very basic split
screening of course um yeah so software
development it's still on Android
13 I
mean I no they don't actually give you
the phone it's a scam uh it's only on
Android you might get an update to
Android 14 that's what that's saying the
display is great okay um it has 5G
connectivity I haven't put my SIM card
in it yet the mediatech thein 750 it's
not as powerful as you know like a
Snapdragon chip but it got where I
needed to do done web browsing loading
applications playing games that I
downloaded on to test it did everything
I needed well um loaded stuff well the
UI I mean there's they did not customize
one bit not one
bit 120 HZ display yes it has that but
it's feeling kind of slow when I scroll
sometimes I don't know why hey what
happened to my
camera can you guys still hear me put it
in the chat if you can still hear me
come on
camera oh there we are back okay yeah so
no no no really design in the software
come on turn
on we're waiting for it to turn on uh
120 HZ display screen is usable right it
I kind of it but sometimes scrolling
does feel a bit laggy
um but it it does work so I'm glad to
see
that we Spong not tuning on for some
reason it did die in our test so I guess
I just have to wait for it to um turn on
now the cameras the wide angle lens it
does have 20 uh 20 time zoom on the
phone
unusable unusable because there's no
optical zoom so it seems like they put
all the focus on the hardware and 108
megapixel camera and nothing on software
I mean there is an AI camera mode but
we've seen that since 2015 18 uh on
Samsung phones so for $300 pretty good
phone if you like the design I like the
big screen curved edges glass back
pretty premium right if you care about
software Nah if you hear about specs
maybe yeah pretty good phone so what
who's this phone for not for
photographers
it I guess it be for gamers maybe
because it's know pretty powerful for
the price uh not people who want to like
hold on to their phones for long because
it's out of the Android version whatever
and it will get updated but then that's
basically it um and because of the
software no customization whatsoever
you're stuck using
Google's Google Suite of applications so
that means you have to use Google photos
Google Drive etc etc etc um which isn't
as good as say Samsung's Alternatives in
my opinion like I like Samsung gallery
versus Google photos but you can
download an external gallery application
so that's not really a big
deal uh if I was ened to new I keep the
same phone same format I like the design
I like the curved edges Etc I changed
this to maybe a 64 megapixel camera save
money right uh I like my 64 megapixel
camera on the A7
was
a72 a71 right and swap out the macro for
two times telephoto Zoom because you
could you know you'll save money you
getting like some old 64 megapixel and
then just put it two times telep photo
Zoom there that'd be great maybe commit
to two years of updates and the front
camera is I guess it's decent and no
maybe maybe
um wait what did I say
maybe we could make the software a
little bit better two years of updates
uh and a little bit more skinning
because stock Android is not as good I
mean if I wanted a pixel I'd get a pixel
7 a so it's competitors would be
obviously Samsung's budget H 835
pixel uh 7A so yeah so if you want a big
screen good design okay cameras like if
you just shoot in normal mode it's kind
of
Overexposed and and yeah technically as
a portrait mode you're not getting this
I I don't
know and yeah it does have that
intelligent photography here but even
here you can see blue which isn't you
know supposed to be it's not a port mod
shot like these are all there the
battery battery is
great okay we got 30 included 30 W flash
charger so I'm glad about that 5,000 m
battery I mean
we beat this we got 15 hours and 36
minutes of video uh provided over
Wi-Fi uh obviously we can't talk for 29
hours eight hours web browsing we can do
that test tomorrow or tonight um no I
don't even know who you are you're fine
hello Kate um are you here to do some
more laptop
shopping and
um yeah all right never to get to this I
like the screen I like the storage 256
not even Samsung's Galaxy Base phone
comes with that has an indisplay
fingerprint scanner it is a little small
it's a little small but you can get to
it and uh it has its own finger bit
scanning animation you can pick three of
them so I do like that it has its own
Niche little Edge display 12 gigs of RAM
I like that though I don't see how you
can get that much use out of it because
it doesn't have those Advanced features
that Samsung has like it doesn't have
the advanced Edge screen picture and
picture applications and stuff for
YouTube
um like running multiple applications on
type of each
other um
Etc dual SIM I do like that uh 5G
LTE and it has NFC support which is
great oh I almost forgot GPS GPS is
Great Indoors indoors GPS uh we got
about uh according application plus or
minus 2 m of
accuracy um and then outside we got
about Plus or is 5 ft of accuracy with
about 50 satellites in View 41 in news
so that was pretty good GPS accuracy has
a great lock um on
GPS um scrolling through Google Earth
and using street view a bit laggy but
nothing that the phone couldn't handle
um yeah so I like the phone oh it does
have its own compos I do like
that um note that this IND display
fingerprint sensor is p takes a picture
and not Ultras
Sonic um yeah and this is be the
competitive so this is their Pro phone I
guess the screen is good I like this the
chip is decent um the camera set
up if the wide angle camera was better
which they said it was eight megapixels
now I'm saying it's five megapixels here
I'm G to have to check um they might
have made a mess up they might have made
a mess up which Corners did they cut
okay
uh software development and updates they
obviously just like took stock Android
put one app on it and was like done and
then like a few features
um cameras they spent all of the
attention on the 108 megapixel camera
but didn't really focus on the software
behind cameras which is why pixels are
so good even though there just 12
megapixel sensors uh um yeah just
software and Camas I mean if the Camas
if this was
a what's it
called this is not a dating chat okay oh
my gosh if this was a $500 phone right
and they just put one attention to the
cameras like got maybe got one of
Google's camera exx exx over and uh and
then maybe some software exx and just
dedicated the extra $200 to software and
optimizing the camera and just switching
the configuration around a little bit
this would be a great phone this would
be the phone to
beat okay this would be up there with
say the
OnePlus uh
12r like it's yeah it's fast uh I mean
obviously not for like stuff like video
editing or anything but normal stuff
fast Snappy the software is good uh not
software the screen is good they just
dedicate a little bit more for a
software it'd be
great um so yeah those are the Camas
they cut the battery is good oh
Bluetooth I did experience some cutting
out issues which is annoying no
headphone jack which is kind of weird
because it does come with the radio
application I don't have a pair of USBC
headphones to test out if they work with
the radio but if there's a radio that
it's good weird it only works with
T-Mobile which is uh good for me because
I have T-Mobile but uh I would not be
able to test the call Quality
if uh of of the Stream
okay so yeah thank you new for sending
this out we will get a full review out
soon and they will
be and some person out there on the
internet who wants to buy a phone we'll
get it next all right now we got our
very own
another
product Lenovo tab M9 and this is from
flip the application so I will do a
review on flip over there make sure you
follow me if you have that app anybody
be asking me like what is flip and
that's how I got all these products the
headphones and the
tablet all right here we go flip app
review so this is this Tik tokes mobile
application that uh is for shopping
right and they added me into the stream
uh as an influencer onto the program and
they gave me flip credit so I could
order my own devices to test out and
promote on the channel uh the flip
Channel over there right and the app is
decent but I have some criticism from it
first of the videos are
not good like the quality of the videos
are not good it's looks like kind of
like 720p um second of all the stuff
that they're selling on there is
overpriced which is fine for me because
I got all the stuff for free but for the
consumers like you that's that's not
good right so this L tab M9 right
regular retails for about $19 right they
if you just search eBay or Amazon for a
brand new one this brand new uh from
lovo tab M9 is
$179.99 on the flip application right so
that's a markup of over $70 which is not
not good right um second of all there is
a low amount of brands at least for
electronics on this thing because flip
is a new app and they don't just take
any Brands the brands are there they
have to get advertised and stuff like
that right now toity flip right the um
you can make money by buying stuff and
then posting reviews and you get extra
money and you also can get uh
percentages off by just liking and
swiping through the application so you
can make about 20 $30 if you spend about
20 to 30 minutes on the application and
you'll get 20 to $30 off of your
purchase so that's decent too also
people can send you stuff if you want it
so like guess it's kind of like wish you
or whatever and also
um when you order stuff if you order
something over $50 you get one free
product something over $100 too and over
$150 you get another free products so
that can off three free products so that
can offset the cost of the high prices
so this is basically how it works right
with uh flip is a marketing company at
its core right it sells you user data
and stuff like that um from and stuff
like clicks and likes and St from the
applications to Brands the brands then
see that and then they put stuff in
there right and also they have these
free advertisements by the people on the
app who buy their stuff and
then who buy their stuff and then
um they make refus about them because
the reason they make the reviews about
them because you buy stuff to flip app
is because if enough people see it
they'll get monetized right so it's way
to make money um which is free
advertisement for well advertisement for
the brands
um the
brands and if you buy a Brand's product
you keep seeing more content coming up
and up and up right um so it's more
advertisement for the brands um user
generated uh ads instead of like just
random advertisers right and then you
have incentive to buy stuff on the app
because they'll give you free stuff and
you have incentive to look at more of
the ads because you because flip and
then flip will get more of your data and
then flip you also have more to do it
because then you'll get um stuff off
right so what I recommend using flip to
like just buy stuff no uh it's
overpriced by about $60 but if you just
engage with the content you can get like
$30 off of that slash if you think hey I
I can make this cuz you you can't you
have to buy something on the app to get
it right if you think hey look this's is
free product um and I think I can make
money reviewing these products which if
you get the free products you have to
review them which is how they keep the
content on the
application um okay just be respectful
this time
um uh you have to keep the viewers
watching the content if they like it and
interact with it then you'll get a
payout which then you can use more money
okay you can use to pay for more stuff
on flip so it's like a self-re repeating
Loop you have to have more people on
here you have to have more eyeballs to
see the ads and then the companies will
come in so if more people come on flip
and more Brands come on flip because
obviously flip has to make money so they
have to mark up make money so they have
to mark up the prices of the prices
anyway if more Brands come on flip then
maybe more people will come on flip but
more people need to come on flip for
more Brands to come on flip so it's like
the chicken and egg scenario which in
real life obviously the chicken came for
because God created them all right
now it's time for adventures and odyssey
segment uh right now they're playing the
episode where Buck joins the NSA sneaks
into a friend's house and investigates
him which
like I
mean I I just wish I could do that
like I've never done any of that ever so
sad what I wouldn't give to
go join the NSA
and get to go to someone's house and
then investigate them that would just be
lots of fun but anyway Adventures in
Odyssey the Trinity okay now adventures
and odyssey uh have this episode
from we're talking about this episode
where Connie Goes to Camp not the Connie
goes to to Camp part one part two
episode Connie Goes to Camp uh this is
when she's like 12 or
something our headphones died on a that
is so sad I didn't even get an
loot where's my case oh they're in here
okay I'll go get the wired
headphones while the SE open is the
headphones charge
up no it's not all right wait oh yeah so
Connie goes to camp and she um what's it
called and apparently Eugene is there
too and they get involved into a prank
war Eugene wins uh it well Eugene and
the boys are winning
60 and I like that
the oh no my poor
headphones what what happened the Jack
fell off let me see
if well I guess I won't be selling these
wireless headphones I need them to um
use
so hopefully these charge up before we
watch a video so there's no echo or
anything but we'll just keep these on
for show um man this is
terrible
okay oh well um yeah and so the the
girls are just really trying to get back
at them and they're trying to lure
goggles who is Eugene's code name at at
the camp onto the
bridge
by and I kid you not and once again
our Doctrine our military Doctrine is
proven right again they try to lure him
onto the bridge by having one of the
girls fake a crush on
him
like I
mean this is why we say if all the ideas
coming from Avent odyy you think I just
make stuff up
no we came up with this from adventures
and
odyssey so um kids if you want to be
successful and study well in life uh
succeed uh listen to adventures and
odyssey great valuable life lessons
embedded in those episodes speaking of
Advent and ay there's been controversy
online since I was in eth grade
um yeah so for like five four something
years since yeah since the middle of
covid yeah so like early middle of 2020
it's been controversial in line
about
the uh Mo Rael Saka where Mr Whitaker
says that he knew that uh what's her
name
Elizabeth Emily yeah Emily and Matthew
were actually in not not in any danger
and he knew that Mo was behind the
escape room and uh he just let it happen
so that they would learn a lesson or
something like that okay
uh but then inep album 67 in uh episode
in escape room episode from 2019 which I
remember where I was when I heard that
episode I was like in the car or
something it was a great great episode
one of the greatest of all time Mr whu
after the end of the episode calls the
um calls detective paals who's like the
police person in in the series
calls detective po
house because he doesn't know what's
going
on what what is
this okay either you're someone from
school who's playing like some random
joke being like the anti me
or you're just some random person here
but we got four people in here which is
more than normal so we won't let you
stay here
what are you yapping about anyway uh if
it's an odyssey thingy yeah where will
we oh yeah escape room right so here's
my
explanation Mr
Whitaker tapes the recording because uh
he plays the recording of the voice and
then demodulates it to moy uh as
evidence and then Moy says someone
hacked my voice and then Mr says nowy do
you really think I'm going to believe
that which in 2020 you know it's kind of
unbelievable nowadays someone hacked my
voice as a legitimate defense someone
hacked my voice is yeah someone actually
hacked some guy's voice and faked him of
uh making racist comments against people
that was a legitimate thing he AI cloned
his voice I mean I've AI cloned
someone's voice uh before so someone
hacked my voice in 2024 as a legitimate
defense but even in 2020 at least in the
ion
Odyssey Universe it that should have
been a legitimate defense and we're
going on a tangent here we got the
imagination station I mean literally the
episode before that myy cloned his own
voice in in the to send uh Emily on an
imagination station adventure with him
in it is it not believable that someone
like novacom could have hacked someone
else's Voice through the imagination
station and then put the recordings on
that is a believable event now obviously
MO is in the wrong he's a terrible
person and I'm probably kind of like him
at least in the terms of computer
science and stuff stuff like that not in
the terrible person Department
um
but someone he voice should have been a
legitimate defense right but there is an
easy explanation to this right during
the escape room episode Mr whu knew
something but he didn't know that myy
was behind it at least he didn't have
conclusive proof that myy was behind it
then he taped it and un and then
demodulated it Jack Daniels Andrew mumby
Google me Christian
what okay it's the weirdest stream I've
ever been on um wait wait yes yes
uh yeah yeah so he didn't have
conclusive proof which is why he called
the police then he demodulates it and
then the next day right Emily is like no
no no no I want to find out myself I
want to find out myself and then Mo goes
upstairs and like miss miss someone
kickn my sister so he didn't knows but
he didn't really know until he demod he
just had a hunch and you know you can't
go off of hunches I scared Kate away I
like her a little bit though can no this
isn't a dating stream goodness don't you
like teenager and a teenage dating
remember okay
um yeah speaking of Aven Odyssey
um speaking of V
Odyssey Colorado headquarters of focus
on the family who is the company behind
VY has just
outlawed scan
I am a Christian called Andrew mumby
Google me please oh thank you
okay it's better not be inappropriate
which is why it's not on the
screen Father Andrew
mumby who was arrested in the December
homicide of 46 old ahuh um yep I think
we're got to call it here Weir stream
that you ever had
anyway uh folks on the family who uh
headquarter in Colorado oh wow we got
six people here headquarter in Colorado
just banned Colorado uh brain Rave
scanning bills yes now you may be
wondering oh says no no no wrong Andrew
Mumy oh okay okay that's good that's
good um I'm glad you didn't Mur to
someone now you mean now you may be
wondering uh why are we talking about
brain scanning and focus on the family
and EV Odyssey and what does it have to
do with anything but everyone knows that
novacom when Odyssey major uh Series
right is L episode where they try to
convert brain waves to radio waves and
invent a new link like device to this is
like 2001 by the way invent a new new
link like device to control the world
and enslave the human race uh which like
a muffin
um anyway Colorado has just
banned uh has passed legislation
protecting your brain wave meant to
exist to protect against Brain scanning
devices like say ninks and stuff like
that right so theyve added them in terms
of privacy laws adding brain wave
patterns to the list of biometric data
already protected like fingerprints and
FAL patterns so I was wondering I am on
Tik Tok okay well look him up here
father and
R uh with 38.3 th000
followers all yeah anyway brain w
patterns this is Val me that are
protected like fingerprints and facal
patterns so I was wondering if folks in
their family had any any um involvment
behind this because you know they made
the novacom series and they're like hey
hey we can't have this this kind of
stuff happening on on live anymore what
do you think you have five people in the
chat
uh all right here we are in the Chom
scrolly application continuing as a
guest
uh I'm just GNA share screen and ask if
this is the guy is this
you okay yeah so brain waves legally
protected in Colorado and the United
well just Colorado right um so yeah what
do you guys think about that and while
you guys are thinking about brain wave
scanning um once again that is you okay
um congratulations
and that that's nice um yeah so now we
have this we selling this Ebay link here
so let me check is the new phone open
because I actually want to show the
software and design in person on here oh
oh I felt a vibration speaking of
vibrations the halfs and vibrations are
they're not that good let me check
something oh and it only support 16
character passwords which is the
same
um now that's kind of funny all right
now um we have
the
uh yeah so they only support 16
character passwords and stuff which is
not a good thing
um I wish they supported longer passw
and of course the uh fingerprint
scanning thing is only Optical so
Optical
is uh not as secure as ultrasonic or
fast but uh in our testing it has done
well so I going to check the flip app
for
updates
um okay here we go let's check flip
I want to see if they need a video on
the tablet yet if they do then we will
unbox it live so this is the flip up
shop flipt shop is the
domain and they have a mobile
application on Android and iOS I have
the application here as part of my deal
with the people oh okay let's
see new products are four times more
likely to go viral so on the flip app
um you have
to oh yes so as you guys can see on the
screen here hopefully you can in in in
and there you go uh the tab M8 is open
so I can make the video here now the
flip app for making videos is about a
bit wonky you can't flip around so I
have uh I had this microphone thingy
with you plugged it in and you'd get
something out of
it and
uh uh where were
we microphone oh yeah yeah so it it was
like a lapel
mic what's I had a microphone here so
you can get the ASMR scroll thingy oh
here we go Robert Robert's back I can't
wait to get the 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro the
rec for screen on the the the the 24
Ultra looks awesome yeah but I mean what
if you're trying to Signal a plane and
you need help or something yeah
so we got our lovo tab M8 here and your
video has to be at least eight seconds
long right I haven't really Ed it yet
we're still opening it up right but let
me just read off the specs from the let
me move the camera down a little bit
read off the specs nine in HD display an
octacore processor which if you're
advertising have an octacore processor
then you know it's bad because
everything has had one for the past 10
years all day battery life which depends
on the day I guess like for apple a day
is 16 hours and thin and light stylist
design powered by Android all right so
they're just really trying hard to
advertise here I'm let me pull out of
the sleeve right and I got to make my
video
so uh let
me oh yeah there we go yes yes um see
the Grain on the screen here this is
kind of what the new
thing look like okay and you got your
accessories in the Box uh the girlfriend
your girlfriend okay has M10 from that
brand nine inches is huge it's kind of
small for a tablet um
okay oh
H oh this design
is something okay it's it's a lot better
than the last tablet we got which I
didn't even see fit to sell all of you
um the Hyundai tablet which people
didn't even know know that Hyundai
wasn't wasn't talking about a tablet
well we're talking about the lovo I
don't even know what brand this is uh a0
M something and we got your sim card
ejector in here which I'm guessing does
this have SIM card capability let me
check because if it does you can still
use this as a phone all right now that
is here we
are nope nope wait wait yeah SIM card
capabilities guys so you can send texts
and calls on here so that that is useful
and we'll be going into the video and of
course micro SD card slot capabilities
and this is an 8 megapixel camera so's
Power It Up only buttons on this side
like most device J power how are you on
this fine day all right we got our lovo
boot up screen a Macbook never heard of
a 9in Macbook but okay um and then we
got this faux texture on the back um I
know it's kind of hard to see because
this camera is atrocious let me turn the
light towards
it so it's all in the thing and then you
got your labels on the back here with
Dolby Atmos speakers all
right so oh it's turned on we got our
thing turned in and we got ample battery
life so I'm just going to do a short
review and then I will record the flip
review live and in in person on air and
then we will have a review of this
tablet coming out man we're finally
getting review devices this is great um
I'm doing okay you know um Ventures and
odyssey episodes are great I'm excited
for the thousandth episode and excited
to finally have review devices like this
brand new phone maybe we can do a speed
test and maybe I can download Asphalt 9
on here to see how it holds up with is
the
phone phone is about three times more
expensive in real dollars not in flip
dollars I just start here in the bezels
you know they're pretty good for a
tablet okay you got your
Lenovo stuff you have to agree
to Okay so we've agreed to all of it
congrats on the free devices thank you
so much um I'm excited I'm glad that I
finally got my flip sponsorship oh I
didn't even know about all right so it's
using GB for the keyboard let me put in
our super secure Wi-Fi
password so you you see
that all right and I think we're in
we're
connected all right
check what oh okay I'm glad you're back
um we're waiting it's connected
we just set up offline I guess because
it is lagging okay so now we're going to
Google services for the set up um just
you know simple normal stuff um when you
set up stuff proba should have set this
up already um so I put a password on
here let
skip all right and you can use three
Buton navigation orj your navigation on
the tablet
um what do you guys
like finish device setup all right so
this is our Lenovo tablet here and these
are the apps and that is the correct
time I think nope it's the wrong time
all right um the Android I do like oh oh
one thing I forgot to mention was
both is this making noise
it's been kind of interesting to see
what stock Android looks like compared
to my skinned Samsung devices all right
so that is the wrong time it is set up
for Eastern Time Zone because it did not
connect to our Wi-Fi all right so we got
Netflix on here kid space I do like that
both devices have
uh multiple accounts on
there um this actual reminds me of
little bit of
Samsung um it's using the outdated
Google message mesages application uh
icon so yeah it does have texting
support and then you got uh
entertainment space so I'm just going to
connect reconnect to the Wi-Fi again the
skin here looks it's it's okay um let me
see what other applications we have here
let me load up
Chrome accept no account okay so I
loaded up Chrome and Netflix which I
don't even know how Netflix p
password I was here just clicked your
link oh yeah yeah I know um
thanks okay so Netflix needs a network
to connect to so I'll connect to the
internet
and yeah so you
got
interesting haptics are not turned on by
default and we are connected to the
Internet so I will see what kind of slip
screening functionalities we have
here none really let me see got the Play
Store I got to sign in for that right
Chrome um Sports multi-tab browsing yes
yes I reviewed a Hyundai
tablet um really cheap looking got it
for free from flip the application oh
oh my Nursery security camera view came
in all right that's great that's great
how fast internet here on here is
all right great I can find my own
website on the tablet right let's see
about split
screening what is that noise
oh yes you can split screen and now let
me see split screen with Netflix so we
got Chrome and oh Netflix is not split
screen what do you think about people
saying that MKBHD can bankrupt companies
I mean he can but I mean the company
deserved it if he bankrupted them if you
don't make a good product you don't
deserve to you know exist as a company
capitalism 101 all right
um so you got to hold down for split
screen and then Chrome here we go
continue so the split screening on here
is a bit more advanced than say
the phone it is a bit laggy but it's
fine it's
doable um so we got let me see if I can
transfer images over here so I'm going
to type in thech
boy and I have a
logo so nothing really too advanced um
you can open multiple applications here
you got
messaging Google Assistant
photos what's one plus one
what's 2 plus
two 2 plus two is four all right so it's
it's good you got split screening
capabilities here um I'd have to
Benchmark it for more stuff let me close
that yeah all right it's great let's
make our video here so here we go I got
my flip app here and you gotta select
the
product what what's the name of the
tablet tab M9 okay
hello flipsters this is the review of
the Galaxy Tab M9 actually First
Impressions it's pretty good I like that
it has SIM card integration so I can
send texts on this device presum maybe
even phone calls the software is you
know it's decent I like the skin uh kind
of reminds me of
Samsung um you can connect to the
internet here now for security um it
does allow face recogition and screen uh
and screen lock nothing too fancy it
also allows split screening uh certain
applications here we have has the Google
Assistant um let me see I want to let
say I want to split screen Google files
and then Chrome on my website there we
go and there Salam not Salam dry scrope
or anything it's good so yeah pretty
decent tablet um is it worth $179 that's
up to you um uh if you want to buy it
from flip but if you wanted to buy it
from say a normal website it's only $19
which then I'd say go for it um it does
only have 64 gabes of storage so that is
a con though it does have expandable
storage God bless Tech talk to you later
all right and then you just have to
upload to the
device to flip and then post r view and
it'll automatically do the tags and
hashtags for that all right so this
tablet will be getting a maybe a speed
test review and then it will be sent off
onto eBay land
so yeah that's great now we also got
this baby monitor
here and it finally came in to the
application I've been playing around
with it for a few days so it is from
Hubble and let us create
that oh we gota wait for it to upload
okay so let's talk about MKBHD
bankrupting companies like the Humane AI
pin I guess the what is it called the
the little orange thing um well the
orange thing the rabbit or1 no that's
what it's called it's basically an app
it does stuff that an app should do it's
a waste of money they setting an app
inside of a plastic container a terrible
camera a trash touchcreen and something
that they called a terminal which is
just typing commands for $299 and the
Humane AI pin is cool but
it's it's not it's not worth it all
right now oh okay fine okay we got this
we got our Hubble connected tablet
thing baby monitor over 2.54 gigz
Network so I was not able to T onto the
uh yeah yeah I saw that it was a Google
pixel a actually oh I know do you still
have the OnePlus phone I'll be waiting
because I have some questions about that
because that's what all this money is
going towards it's going towards a new
phone yeah the rabbit the uh hey hey be
nice to J
power okay now we have our Hubble
connected device here I just need to
talk about that and there are two
cameras in the Box over there but you
guys don't really need to see them uh at
least the flip St so I'll just put it
down on the keyboard
and hello flips today we're reviewing
the Hubble connected uh baby monitor
here it comes with two cameras in the
Box charges over USBC and has two uh
four gigahertz network connection and
there's an included application in the
box now it is an interesting um monitor
here it's touchscreen and the volume
button is actually wrong so this is up
and this is down it's kind of weird and
you can talk back to the baby do the
camera Etc and I do like that it has
USBC charging um just is not a camera
it's like a speaker or something um now
it is a bit laggy when you're trying to
move throughout the interface see that's
app there U move through Dr the
interface you can play songs on it no
recording unless you use the app um and
sometimes it doesn't sync well with the
thing and then when it doesn't do that
it starts making a weird beeping noise
actually I'm going to go get the camera
right there see they in this box I
paired one with it and here's the
camera okay it's also over USBC so you
just have to plug it in and when I plug
this in it should automatically syn and
when it sinks it does well it see it's
not connected right now when it sinks
let me unplug this when it sinks it does
well you can control the camera using
Taps but when it's not synced it makes
that annoying beeping noise that I'm
sure is making you guys very angry right
now sorry uh YouTube
listeners okay so it's plugged in right
now
um and I turned it on
cut that
out and yeah it's not even paying right
yet okay let turn it off
hello flipsters here we are with the
Hubble connected baby monitor again uh
it's touchscreen baby monitor we got our
camera here it's turned on all 2.4
gigahertz it has a touchcreen not a
camera there and it also has application
capabilities though you have to pay for
it um this is volume up this is volume
down that's power off I don't know why
they did it like that um it pairs to the
camera uh with the antenna here it
should be pairing since this is on so
it's looking for it and when it does PIR
you can control by swiping and tapping
on the screen um it is a bit laggy here
and there is a lock here so that I guess
baby doesn't start messing with it or
something I don't know why it's not um
connecting but when it does connect
image is decent um and of course you can
talk out of this or you can hear the
baby the baby can talk back to you and
then you can talk into it here and the
touch screen is kind of finicky it does
have these things here oh there we go
uh
oh you can talk to baby play sounds turn
on a flashlight which is actually on the
back of here for some reason I don't
know why you need a flashlight but yeah
there's that and then you have stories
that the Hubble baby mon can play so
yeah here are got video stories Hubble
play Moon he by flip got bless Tech talk
to you
later so yeah it's basically a short
form video application and let me turn
this
off and yeah so if you guys want this
baby monitor that will also be going up
on eBay soon all right I me I had to
unplug the phone again for that um oh
and you can trim stuff on the trim stuff
on The Lucy pal deluxxe twin thing uh on
the flip app like you can trim the video
um a no no
okay okay um and yeah so if you guys
want to follow me on flip my profile is
at the techboy uncore media I have eight
votes okay and uh
my logo is the tech booy logo and it
says to of DET tech.org Jesus save so
that's how you know it is me
as you can see here I've made
$6 20 from engaging with people on flip
uh I've used some of the money already
and then I've also made some engagement
flip cash oh yeah you would here yeah so
flip is this social media not really
social media application so imagine Tik
Tok but for videos so that's what I was
recording the videos for wait that
sounds stupid imagine Tik Tok but for
products right so flip sent me some of
these products here because I'm a
reviewer and they want me to you know
get ahead and promote stuff on the
channel Etc get more viewers here here's
how it works you have advertisers uh
companies Brands who have their stuff in
the store you can pay for it uh buy it
in the app when you buy it on the
app when you buy it in the app they then
send it to you pretty good shipping time
at least for me and then you can make
reviews about them and then you'll make
money off of that right and also
engaging with the feed so you got you
know uh let me make the screen big when
you engage with the feed right um you
also make money if you like love the
product like just like make money to
save on it um now in the application the
stuff is overpriced because they need to
make money to send the stuff out but in
return you can get some free products uh
if you spend a specific amount of money
um you
can you get money for watching and
engaging with it so essentially flip
gets the data customers get products
when they buy stuff from the store and
they also can have a potential to make
money and become influencers and
creators and then companies get to have
all these people on the app you know
basically making user generated conduct
for it and that basic get free
advertisement you can add stuff from the
cart directly from the video now would I
recommend buying stuff off it no unless
you think that you can make money off of
it for instance the tablet that I showed
off I got it for free because I was you
know I'm paid to promote it or use the
app right but I'm honest with my
customers I got it for free but normally
it cost
$179 but in real life like say buy off
eBay Amazon it cost
$19 however you can get rewards and paid
so if you think you can do that then
maybe maybe not
yeah so we haven't reacted to any videos
yet um I think I can even show you what
flip looks like on here
so here is the flip. shop
website
and yeah no here so here's the tablet
that we got here $172
you can buy it free Tunes all the time
um ships in a day it's basically like
Drop Shipping I guess and then when you
look at it you'll find some of the
videos about the tablet from people like
you who paid money from it so it's
basically video reviews here you can
swipe the app if you're on your
phone you can also go
live which I have not not done
yet maybe our next thing we can go live
and then also in here you can upload
stuff that you want and then maybe some
people on flip will be like oh I love
you so much I'll give it to you so yeah
that is what flip is all
about of course makes be sure to read
their privacy policy and everything
makes okay with the data that you
collect about you and the phone because
obviously they're selling the data about
interactions to the company so they can
sell you know more ads about it oh let
me put this charger in the box so yeah
we made our video about the baby
monitors so if you want the baby monitor
uh it is on sale on eBay and will go on
sale right after this podcast
in it's the most interaction we've had
in the podcast in a while thank you guys
for being mostly supportive and mostly
respectful and mostly normal
okay now let's get into
our video here someone actually thinks
that Apple's going to buy Tik
Tock it'd be kind of funny um then
really Apple's
gonna yeah everyone's gonna have an
iPhone I mean it be it's gonna be the
killer
app um
I'm looking for a video
here oh I saw this interesting video
last week I forgot to get to it but
uh Wendy's was uh
replacing uh Drive things with AI which
is kind of interesting um they might
actually heal you right for the first
time actually I've never been to a
Wendy's drivethru so I'm not sure if
that's a thing but I know some
drive-throughs they don't hear you
correctly um Chick-fil-A is different
because the people actually you know
come stand out there with the
tablets
um oh oh our new phone is coming on
finally um so yeah let's talk about the
AI for drivethru
restaurants oh man it just died on us
again so the phone is still dead after
15 hours and 36 minutes of of living and
playing our video so that's great
oh this Wendy's AI story is old it
um it's just a YouTuber didn't get
around to creating the content about it
for use speaking of YouTu uh not you
mons speaking of
YouTubers um
um where we be oh yeah M the boss has
come under Fire for something and that
why power reporter lady forgot her name
that's come under Fire for like doxing
people or something T Taylor Taylor LZ
something actually has a YouTube channel
she spoke with Mr
MKBHD um about
his you know his job something so I
thought hey maybe we should reach out an
interviewer on the show what do you guys
think about that um I think it'll be a
really interesting interview she only
has 15,000 subscribers so she might come
on might not but
yeah
um where we oh yes M K BHD
Disney has a secret project so here we
go this talk off the rabbit R run which
has just become outed as
a basically an app in a box could you
imagine if Google tried to share uh sell
sorry it's it's uh Chrome on one device
that was like a square and say hey this
is the
this is the Google Chrome
box never mind that that's a bad example
that's actually something that exists uh
could you imagine if Samsung tried to
sell its Bix in in like a box and say
hey this is the Bixby
box I
mean to be fair that's kind of like what
smart speakers are like Alexa and Google
Assistant you can get them on your
phone but Alexa Google Assistant are
$30 and are dedicated and are cheaper
this is $200 so for comparison you can
either get the rabbit
R1 or you can get the new phone with a
decent camera okay software good
performance the B30 Pro
5G
um for the same price almost and then
you can install on its massive 256 gab
SSD you can
install you know chat tvt co-pilot
Gemini uh Google
Lens um and then do some Integrations
and boom you have your own thing and you
actually have a phone that can make
phone calls and has a workable touch
screen hey all right now here we go
rabbit r one barely
reviewable um
the
road oh
no so where's the audio going does it
still think it sync to my oh it's
muted all right let's see if the
headphones charged up again so that
these
don't you know I do wish the headphones
had battery indicators I don't want the
sound to
Echo there we
go is it
connected this whoa whoa whoa well okay
The Sound Works I'm glad about that
sorry and just in case we'll keep the
microphone at the camera because it's a
dual thing so our microphone is still
coming from the camera our speakers are
coming to that's great here we go it's
the rabbit R1 from Mr I mean sorry MKBHD
is the rabbit R1 and it's another AI in
a box and it's a sign of the times so
this thing here it has a lot in common
we know what it is we know what it is
um so here here's how it's
bad so yeah this thing is awes
bad at a lot of stuff and this this list
is going to sound pretty familiar
somehow the battery life is just as bad
as the Humane pin it has which which is
not which doesn't even make sense first
of all you have way more surface area
approximately four of these would fit on
here and yes they do have a screen that
they have to drive but I mean look at it
this is what is driving most of the time
right you have all the space to put a
battery and it's running one app inside
of an app it's you is literally one app
how can you be that bad of a battery
just make it a little bit th thicker
it's not like anyone's going to buy it
anyway it's an experimental thingy has
a, milliamp hour battery inside 1,000
milliamp battery for comparison some
watches have a four 100 milliamp battery
right this these headphones have it
doesn't say um so five of these equals
one new phone okay four of these equals
one Samsung phone
um and like two watches equals this and
even this this Nokia phone with a
removable battery a non-touchscreen
right so you doesn't even need that big
of a battery has a 1,200 milliamp
battery I'm holding it here in my
hand so this Nokia phone has more
battery than a touchscreen Internet
connected AI device which this
technically you can't connect to
internet just only over T and it's
brutally bad like it's already bad
enough when you're carrying around a
whole another device alongside your
smartphone look at this this phone here
Galaxy s204 Ultra 5,000 m battery this
thing is about two times thicker right
and maybe about yeah you should be able
to fit a big battery in there this one
can sit in front of you doing nothing
and the battery just visibly is draining
and dies in like four hours then you
have to charge it multiple hours doing
nothing not hour was screen on time like
my phone before hour was screen on time
you video editing video uh taking yeah
it's probably going to die right this
new phone 15 hours screen on time just
watching a video that phone 4 hours
screen on time doing nothing multiple
times per day and it's still dead when
you wake up in the morning like it's
just exhausting also it took 40 if it's
a small battery it's charge Fast Five
Minutes to charge this tiny battery from
zero to 100 and it's also 45 for context
the OnePlus phones can charge up to like
70% J power do you still have a OnePlus
12 should I and should I get one the uh
yeah control up to 70% about 4,700
minute battery in 15 minutes 30
minutes also just straight up missing a
ton of what I would consider just basic
features like they can't set alarms
can't set timers it can't record videos
can't record photos which okay fine it's
just an AI tool but you should be able
to you know at least take a picture I
mean even Humane AI pen can take
pictures and record videos uh allbe it
15-second videos that are kind of
square-ish and you probably wouldn't
even want to post and etc
etc
um and the camera here is like a scroll
wheel for some reason not scroll wheel
but like you know have to turn it around
I mean they got their design inspiration
from a literal kids tablet and if you
don't think I'm telling the truth look
at here
okay we actually have one of these or
had one of these the VTEC Ino tab which
is the innovation of this thing okay
here's the VTEC inot tab currently $18
on
eBay as you can see here this tab is
very Innovative as it has a turnaround
camera where you can take pictures of
the sky your face or the floor for $18
this thing here is $200 and you used to
be able to take pictures of both at the
same time can't send emails there's no
calendar you can't send
emails
like that would be the most useful thing
send an email to Susie telling her be
late for a 2PM meeting I mean even
Google Assistant can do that if an
assistant made when I was eight years
old um can do the same thing that your
app in a Box Thing cannot do it is a
junk product built in there's just a lot
of things that I would want an assistant
to do not here and of course being in
yes we've been able to do this stuff
since 2015 on Alexa AI assistant it also
does still hallucinate and confidently
answer questions wrong like my Baseline
of asking a question that I know the
answer to and then getting the wrong
answer happens all the time just one of
the downfalls of this category which is
annoying because then you have to put it
phone fact check
like so this device was designed by
teenage engineering and they're really
leaning into that yeah so hallucinations
bad battery life etc etc now here's what
makes it even worse this is a touchcreen
right right right so I want I want you
to see the unit uh user interface okay
now remember we're in the year
2024 it it is May okay just remember
that and to adjust bright that's how you
have to address brightness with a scroll
wheel Blackberry call they want the
school wheel
backness oh here we go here we go here's
how you navigate the UI which makes
sense because it's only one app it's not
even its own operating system it's an
Android app running inside an Android
box it's basically a virtual machine of
an Android box yeah you just you can't
do it with one hand it works so you can
learn it and you can say you know it's
this quirky UI it's got going on but I
feel like a lot of these problems would
be solved quy is not a selling point
okay you you know those devices like
this
phone the minimal
phone uh what was
it here it is an eink c phone on
Indiegogo
like I say qu is not a selling Factor
nor is not using a device oh look it's a
phone that's from 2007 and has a
terrible screen so it's good battery
life but I don't want to use it that's
not a selling point terrible design
terrible software and purpy making it so
that you don't want to use it is not a
selling
point that that's not a selling point oh
well see all things worse because you
don't you don't want to scroll on Tik
Tok
so I mean literally making money off of
people not doing something is
crazy anyway back to the rapit r one let
just
no selling something that is objectively
worse and is designed to be objectively
worse it' be fine if it's objectively
worse but you designed it to be the best
that's what the smartphones are they
have to you know take stuff off they
have to stuff but selling something
though I do like the idea of a keyboard
on the phone selling something that's
exactly worse and then selling it for a
lot of money and then having the oh it's
worse because it's better for you that's
just I mean what I do a company like
that I mean if people want to buy it
sure sure now would I use it no no but I
just think it's not a good idea solved
if this was a touchcreen
so what if I told you this is a
touchcreen and
which would be interesting because I'm
pretty sure someone could find a way to
hack into it or hack hack it to make the
touchcreen work especially now that we
know it's an Android phone speaking of
hacking
phones I have this to show you people
now this is actually interesting this is
the thing called the Y
phone which of course is a another
terrible phone that's designed to be a
terrible phone it has Wi-Fi in it so you
know it's from this
year but 20 7 called they want your
feature phone that you got from the gas
station back it's a hackable modular
phone which means you can connect a
multimedia to it and add stuff to it do
you know what people actually G to add
to it when this goes out into the public
a
screen they might even add these things
uh called apps that um they let you
actually do stuff on your
phone see see this phone is so good it
doesn't need have Caro support it it's a
vo phone yeah it's your own little VP
phone which if I wanted that I download
my own little V IP phone on my already
nice big 6.6 inch touchscreen device or
maybe even my 9 in Lal T M9 or maybe
even the baby monitor because it's
probably running a fork of
Android it's a minimal Wi-Fi phone it
makes calls and sends text messages
that's it you may think oh wow it's so
secure
so SEC no no it runs
V okay so it still connects to the
internet it has to connect to the
internet but they on an internet
connection the phone doesn't
work so you're getting a worse
product that you know you can take the
back off of and then maybe like shock
with the multimeter like like what else
are you going to do with it change the
keys around so that one corresponds to
seven two corresponds to eight three
corresponds to
five it's has no cell radio on purpose
no physical or internet based tracking
apps no apps minimal G GUI yes see it's
a phone that anybody like oh it's for
privacy it's for privacy you know the
the F it's for criminals who don't want
the FBI to
track right of course of course yeah on
a vo phone which means you have an IP
address I mean
you won't be able to locate yeah you
locate it I mean come on besides if the
FBI run is not they have to raid the
website because there' be like three
people who buy their phone and I ask for
a unit it can work separate separately
from a normal phone system without the
government regulated phone number right
of course of course because you know the
government doesn't regulate VoIP uhuh
VoIP is this wild w West of you know
bunch of cyber criminals but you know
the good old American phon systemm
completely right no that's not how it
works you don't think oh the FBI won't
be able to track track me down here if
you require mobile connectivity we
recommend using a Hotpot right so so
it's a Wi-Fi phone that's working based
oh my gosh oh my gosh this is worse in
2007
phones uh had you know actually had data
connection um you can use them as a
hotspot for your laptop and then you can
get internet from it
they're saying that if you need mobile
connectivity you need to pay for a
sellal
plan
and uh get a hot spot drag that around
and use that as a phone you know what it
sounds a lot like on a hard work for a
phone that wouldn't even been accepted
in
2007 um if you need to make a phone call
some phone network you need a phone
number that can be to most commercial
for uh providers yes yes see you you'll
need to still pay for a phone number and
then you can port forward it to Google
Voice and then Google Voice will forward
it to you you know what this this sounds
like a lot of work for what you can do
on a normal smartphone
um you don't need to put a SIM card in a
smartphone you can run off of Google
Voice all day and you know you can
actually download these things called
apps and do stuff and you can have GPS
and you can actually take pictures
without having
to find some random camera and then
solder it into the back of the
phone a Wi-Fi is designed to be a tool
that gets out of the way the open source
OS is simple and easily modified you
think they make their own operating
system no it's add its core asop
Android the back the phone can be
replaced with custom circuit boards oh
isn't that nice oh I connected my own
circuit board to the phone though I
guess this would be useful for
explaining how episodes like uh the
escape room works but just suu just
connects her back battery to the end of
the terminal and hack TI to or something
for dedicated user buttons that's nice
microphone at the bottom head headphone
jack again nice loudspeaker removable
back some is that the processor my gosh
end a Wi-Fi antenna which I mean what if
someone would have take that out or it's
useless
now
what um you can s offline text messages
that is useful though I did find this
after that's using Bluetooth text
messages so that's
good um yes finally this is one good
feature why is connection directly
between phones using its own radio that
should be added to every
phone you can learn
programming I don't know what you
program on a phone that only makes calls
and texts hey it sends text a little
faster or hey you can change the UI it's
a little
better aluminum frame all the aluminum
be kind of nervous about the
connectivity all
right oh also store contacts that's
great so yeah there we go but back to
the Rabid Rob
one don't really let you use it for
almost anything like moving through
these menus would be easier if I could
just tap what I wanted to right going
back after a long scroll would be easier
if I could just flip scroll look at that
he's scrolling like one one and a half
revolutions to get one down it's not
intuitive at all or fast which could be
on purpose because obviously they can't
fit a good CPU in well they could fit
but you know what I mean it's probably
not a good CPU in obviously has to be
like what budget phones you're using so
they probably just AR ificity slowing it
down like ha so like keep it down CU
like think about for a touch screen you
have to constantly scan for touch inputs
probably uses more battery so they
probably intentionally limited this
to deflect the real problem which is
processing power and battery life scroll
back to the top of a list and hit back
but you can't the only thing you can use
the touchcreen for is basically typing
on the keyboard in terminal mode so with
terminal enabled you can turn it
sideways a keyboard pops up and you
terminal mode it's
like it's like you're a hacker or
something no and get text answers which
is great and you can move between
letters with age of the sun obviously
it's got to be wrong 6,000 years the
scroll wheel it's kind of a neat feature
I guess but why which they Mak this look
so hackery oh wow look it's the Google
RCS thing it's in it's in red text
you're like on Powers shell I that
terminal remote might do something like
interesting like make like let you code
onto the spice or sync up no just why
can't we use the touchcreen for anything
else is it just them trying not to look
too much like a
smartphone
maybe probably no it's probably because
adding that would be
too complicated
[Music]
so okay what's the point why does this
thing exist if it's so similar to the
other one that was also so bad what are
we doing here uh and really there's two
things that I think they're hoping will
be the things that set it apart from the
other one that should in the words of
their co-founder Jesse but I don't think
I don't think MKBHD will say this is the
worst device he ever reviewed so far
which low bar but okay those two things
are no well he didn't he just said it
was Bailey rable the price tag and the
large action model so the Humane pin was
so easy for everyone to dunk on because
it was it costs as much as a phone it
was
$700 with a $24 a month subscription to
not turn into a brick it's just insane
so this one right here costs $200 and no
subscription so you know okay that that
hits a little different but also you can
tell it's $200 first of all you you will
need a separate SIM card to get it to
work on cellular so while there is no
subscription fee for rabbit to keep the
device working that is still a fe that's
nice it in that you know keeps your
device un like Humane um and you have
this L large action model which why is
this not turning on it's been plugged in
at Enterprise Mobility our experts
always see another road because when
there's no limit to how far Mobility can
go there's no limit to how far
businesses can
go oh speaking of phones my phone got
added to the Google tracking uh find my
device Network where you can have like
offline finding pretty
interesting battery as we learned and no
f look it's already dead oh not dead 58
it's at 77 when we started now I don't
know if this is a different day but
still see fast charging or wireless
charging and it comes in one color
really bright orange like this
ridiculously saturated bright orange I'm
not even joking the color you're seeing
in this YouTube video on your screen
it's going to be the best I can do with
my own color correction but it's
legitimately hard to photograph like the
phone camera hey maybe the new phone
could do it cuz I mean that is super
saturated like my threee leaves were
green doesn't really turn saturation up
high enough to really represent it
accurately in real life it's the
brightest orange thing you've ever seen
in your life I guarantee it now if you
want something a little more lowkey than
the neon orange Channel sponsor dbrand
actually does have you covered kind of
funny that your leg debrand now after
they
use profanity to describe someone's name
which
is oh yeah I think you get the
idea so you know how the Humane AI pin
had no apps well this thing also this
has an app it is an app it's an app in a
box no apps but the other thing that
they're hoping will separate it from the
other stuff is what they're calling a
large action model so you know large
language models are just the words the
language that we use so it's an AI that
can take our natural language and
process it and turn it into words in
return and that's how we interact with
it so a large action model is supposed
to take our words G to take the words
and do what it says uh what idea I think
it's a really really cool idea you know
large language models have been trained
with all their data to talk back to us
just like humans would and some of are
very convincing so a large action model
in theory should be able to use
these apps and services just like a
human would from Spotify to Twitter to
your so nice app to whatever else well
banking I wouldn't want know someone to
be able to get into the banking but I
mean I can kind of do this on my phone
by setting up script tap on the screen
but having an AI do that that
understands the phone and knows where
all everything is even though able to
change it that would be nice already
good enough at recognizing major UI
elements like a play button or a buy
button and things like that so with
enough training data could get really
good with enough training data could get
really good but the thing is they don't
have a ton of training data yet so as
you know what they need to do they need
to go to a wit in the imagination
station when that thing the AI is great
right now they have made four apps
available four they have online Port
right Spotify it's always ubu like even
the nothing phone or with the lights on
the back of it yeah I started off of ubu
is ubu like this really big I mean I
know what it is but is it really really
big like does everyone use it portal
called the door dash of course which
interesting they don't have Uber Eats
and in mid journey I didn't know that
they had apps Spotify okay the rabbit
hole where you can log into and enable
all of them Spotify okay so it has that
you
know Uber door Dash and mid Journey so
the rabbit can talk to these four apps
and has a UI on the screen for doing so
in the exact way that we're theorizing
so it'll play Spotify songs like I can
ask it for a song and it'll try to play
the right one and it'll show you any
info you need on that's interesting hey
big Speed play like I mean Alex has been
able to do this since 2015 on the touch
screen to confirm or refine the actions
you're taking but even now they kind of
work like play a song like like I've
already had issues with it playing the
wrong song I've also seen other people
already have issues let see I wanted do
a dash it didn't let me choose what I
wanted and incorrectly D it to my house
instead of
work I mean at least it automatically
select the highest tip option okay
that's probably something going do Dash
is sp to like yeah with the door Dash
app getting things wrong which is even
more frustrating I can't imagine how
frustrating the Uber app messing up
would be it definitely seems like it
yeah I would not want to take out this
device is gon to be dead in four hours
say hey I I want Uber to this place and
to go this way and it's that would be
terrible he' picking up the wrong
people needs more training data and
that's just for these four starting apps
now rabbit in order to get the training
data they need people to use it only way
get people to use this a you just give
them away or B release the app and have
people use it and of course the app has
to be free and then just take the rabbit
R1 as a loss make rabbit R2 better maybe
even start a line of rabbit
smartphones says they have 800 different
apps trained already but they just
haven't built a UI for it yet so it's
not available yeah the UI is based on an
Android app on the rabbit
yet at Enterprise Mobility we never stop
looking for new Mobility yeah you may be
wondering like why you keep talking
about this
rabbit R1 app like they honestly didn't
do this right
no the abbit R1 is an AI box I mean
imagine trying to sell chat gbt on a
tablet and say hey it's the Vol AI
tablet
um it runs a smartphone operating system
Android and an Android app on a limited
$200 box and the problem that's probably
why the battery life is so bad Android
smartphones 200 sub 200 and smartphones
are designed to have 4,000 minute
batteries 6 inch screens this has a 1
doe battery 2in screen and has random
inputs that haven't been on Android
phones since the HTC M1 HTC dream sorry
of uh T-Mobile G1 of 2008 like a scroll
wheel and a rotating camera which has
never been on Android phone an action
button and a non touchcreen
um yeah
so it's it's useless I want to see if I
can get it work on my phone let's let's
see let's let's go down here
uh rabbit R1 F
APK right let's back to the video while
we're looking for the APK soltion an ADD
oh wait working on something called a
gill in the works now they've also
theoretically started working on
something called a generative UI where
essentially it can recognize what type
of app it is and then build a UI for it
so Rabbit doesn't have to but that's a
that would be great that would be
useful that would take a lot of battery
and would die so still theoretical and
also on the road map and still in the
works and then if there's another app or
service that you want your rabbit to be
able to do like some it would be nice if
phones integrated gener UI software and
just had everything where you wanted it
where you need it based on usage history
and a iPad on device of for you want
that you know on the cloud getting
hacked like at 932 he used this app at
954 he used this app leave iten
something for work or something super
Niche that you've invented they've
talked about something called Teach mode
which is basically having the rabbit
watch you now that would be useful I
would well I wouldn't pay now but
allegedly pay money for that you do what
you want it to do on your mouse and
keyboard and then it learns from what
you did and can then repeat your actions
later which is sick unfortunately you
can probably already see where this is
going teach mode is also not available
a it's not out yet
as of right now this is something
they're still working on vetting and
finishing and so that's just later this
year also in the works so as of right
now this device has none of that stuff
just the four kind of half working apps
that we went over at the beginning yeah
so that's the rabbit R1 for you
guys
and let's see if there's anything
interesting here
and see if the phone turns on if not
then this podcast will be over
soon oh oh oh for got a
vibration maybe not in
way I do like that it's 30 W USBC
charging I do not want this to fall the
resell value would go
down uh it actually uses a different
type of glass on the front that does use
in the
back well it's not turning on right now
so God bless and Tech talk to you later</pre>
