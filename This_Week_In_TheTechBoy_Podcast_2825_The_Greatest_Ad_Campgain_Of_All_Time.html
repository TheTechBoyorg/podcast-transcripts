<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 2825 The Greatest Ad Campgain Of All Time</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to the this
weekend the Techo podcast we have so
much to get to today from the Super Bowl
and the national antham we also have to
talk about some tech twins in chat
messaging and people um and also some
new SSA ltw politics that just got
unveiled due to a discussion with
chrisye leemon which had the greatest
marketing campaign of all time L iie
lying to W and getting her to say that I
liked her then I said that well whatever
happened no one cares here's a
screenshot
of um what you said and then we got more
people to care about SS ltw so yes it's
greatest marketing strategy of all time
you're welcome Christy leemon anyway um
here is a video and I wanted to show you
guys this video because I I've been
thinking about this all the time like
you know I I think that sometimes like
in TV and movies and etc etc it can be
sometimes hard to tell if someone is an
actual teenager versus if the actor is
actress is playing a teenager it's more
so for girls than for boys but I me you
can see here like girls can have all
these different types of looks right and
people talk about that this's uh this
this's this theory of um black girl
magic which obviously doesn't exist
doesn't exist I don't believe that but I
mean I think what we're about to witness
right here is white girl magic so
without further Ado let's um turn to the
cameras let's
go
Ro the BS Bur
[Music]
I that our flag was still
[Music]
there
that
and
[Music]
banana and the home of the
all right great so um what what you guys
witnessed right there was truly
impressive what we just saw right there
was this woman same woman I thought she
got like four different people no I
looked in I looked at I looked through
her Channel and stuff like that it's the
same person who just by changing her
hairstyle and whatever shirt she was
wearing changed her entire appearance
you know you have all these kids
apparently can do this too right I mean
it is it is insane I have never seen
anything like it before
anything I I I'm astounded I'm astounded
by what we just saw it
I how how does someone change like that
and when you see in TVs and movies you
have like these 24 25 year old woman
playing 16 17 year old woman and
they
um anyway they look like um they they
they look
like they actually look like 16 17 18
you know 19 whatever they're supposed to
be playing you're old woman you have all
all these
people they they look they look the
exact same like how how are we supposed
to tell how we supposed to know we have
to look it up like I believe pot wins
and they did tell me that they filmed
the show in 2020 not 2024 which um which
is nice had this like college freshman
girl girl you look her up she's 31 right
now so in 2020 she might have been no
the show came out in 2024 so she might
have been 31 in 2024 so four years off
that she's 27 maybe for 26 if she didn't
have her birthday yet how does a 26
yearold play a
18yearold like do do do you guys have
some sort of talent where you can like
the age by 10 years I mean looks like
apparently girl stop a stop aging at
like 18 you at 18 you know you can age
up you can age down whatever for
whatever part you're about to play this
doesn't really work on men but like what
what are they doing and Al this woman
right we always talk
about um we always talk about
how we there's this meme like oh women
live lives on easy mode right and you
can say oh well no no no no no women
don't live lives on easy mode apparently
influential women do influential women
do like this this this is this is actual
PR privilege right here okay this woman
she's a decent single she made one she
made one decent song Whatever right but
that's not all of her content okay or
not even most of her content Liv Liv
saringan is 26 I believe 4 400 million
subscribers here and let's look at the
most popular videos the most popular
videos and yes they are funny but do
they are they deserving of the thousands
and thousands of views I I think she
deserves them but I will think that
there's some type of privilege that's
going on here not like white privilege
or anything that's a scam was this like
the whole woman live life on easy mode
yeah maybe maybe that that that is
potentially possible I mean let's look
at this letting the posted in front of
us control Our Lives
242,000 views eating fast food the
entire day 260,000 views try not to
laugh almost 400,000
views I to try not to laugh you I looked
at the video this look random Tik toks
that they didn't create and they try not
to laugh so essentially it's a 17 minute
video of them making bubbles and um if
they fail then they laugh and they get
content out of that
what you you tell me that's not living
life on easy mode you sit you sit in
front of a camera you start yapping and
laughing and um you get paid millions
and millions of dollars to sit there and
make bubbles you know who also can sit
there and make bubbles four-year-olds
that's what they do when they're told to
sit down and be quiet right and it's
this entire influen internet culture
thing that we have here like we talked
about this um last podcast episode it
was these people yapping about some
nonsensical stuff it's always people
like on Twitch over here yapping about
what some celebrity was doing or what
celebrity went crazy or whatever some
weird internet beef like I think this
about to be a football game a flag
football game streamed tomorrow on the
day of the big game um hopefully the
Chiefs win and then my Texans can go in
and win the next four Super Bowls
hopefully um on on the big game where
just random stream moves and celebrities
playing with each other and I don't even
know what they're famous for right you
have these people like sunny to and uh
who who analyzes these people and I'm
like who are you who are you even like
there's some streamer or Tik tocker or
YouTuber or what's the other thing twit
twitcher um not Twitchy but twitcher who
uh apparently is named leafy and he's
famous for something and he makes videos
and make all these reaction videos but
they don't really do anything they
always have their nice little aesthetic
game game gaming computer there maybe
they like do a play with me thing and
then they might say something stupid
they might say something you you know
political or something and everyone like
we like you oh no we don't like you or
something and then they have all the
little chats going on here you also have
that crazy guy um that crazy guy I
forgot what what he
does some crazy guy who kind of like
screams into the cam and people on the
twitch stream chats go crazy I don't I
don't really understand intern that
culture I don't know where it's going I
don't even know where these people have
like there's millions and millions of
podcasts I don't even know who these
people are like when you look at the top
podcast on spot I list especially what's
her name Alex Cooper or something like
that call my daddy podcast like why are
these people famous who made these
people um famous who who the heck made
Haley Welsh famous like he says one
thing on a pod on on a on a video Street
interview she walks around and now she's
on you know in in influencers and maybe
like meeting Mr Beast or something like
that like who gave this woman power
right so you know there has to be some
type of uh proof like there has to be
some type of
there has to be some type of thing
living life on easy mode like you got
you got hired for your looks and now
people expect you to Yap with something
and um of course you know if you get
high for your looks you don't have a
brain then well things happen and you
get stuck here yapping like I'm here
yapping but you know I actually you know
made a tech company uh when I was 13
years old all right what's next up on
our agenda oh yes the greatest the
greatest marketing campaign of all time
right so Christy leemon he was
essentially the girl version of me over
on X right so she's just going she
weaponizes crop tops for political gain
um oh wow she actually liked this uh she
liked this so she could be listening to
this right now so if you're listening to
this right now
um
uh
um uh she could be listening to this
right now so drop a thing right now cuz
I'm about to drop the greatest marketing
campaign of all time promoting SS ltw
and it was by doing some unethical
things mostly lying lying on who name
who 170 follow a Canadian name so you
know I I that is constitutional it is it
is legal to lie about 17 follow Canadian
people right that that that's in the
Constitution right it it is it is okay
in fact it is moral right you know in in
in the fourth first of the national an
them then conquer we must when I cause
it is just and this be a model and guide
me trust essentially that means that it
is my patriotic American duty to lie to
her anyway right see you know
weaponizing crop tops political gain
fiercely patriotic for the wrong country
but whatever so she's essentially me but
we go back and forth and we argue all
the
time SS ltw is a high IQ website Chris
Theon right now usually when I app ssw
right you know I I have two viral tweets
this week and none of them are about ssw
and none of them were about technology
you know I'm technology and name only
I'm a tyo anyway um she said that she
did not say this she said that it was
hard to read SS ltw but she didn't say
that when you get behind the meaning
that means ssw is a high IQ website and
instead of getting like the two views of
the two people who read ssw we got 85
views here because I baited her I baited
her into coming into saying that see I
asked her for proof of saying that she
didn't say that and I brought proof SSA
is a high IQ series then she tried to
call me out for having artificial in
intelligence generated content thank you
Sam forgot to crop that out apparently
but you never relent you never back down
you never give up right you say I
cropped it back out I found it here on
the pin tweet and she said it's fake
fake fake I said it's fake fake fake
cancel out fake she says I'm liar but
fake equals real so no the sentence
would be no it's not real real real we
keep going back and forth so you guys
know what this does we boost it
interactions because we all know we all
know that controversy drives clicks
that's the number one the techboy media
strategy controversy drives clicks um so
uh uh controversy drives clicks and pay
se's listening let's say
um anyway controversy drives clicks
everyone knows that that's why we over
here supporting you know crop tops and
the uh
the cake and cinnamon rolls cuz it's all
C's never B's never D's never e it's
always it's always the three C anyway
counting this
whatever controversy drives clicks so
that number one total marketing uh
strategy sscw and hopefully we got some
new um wait this didn't go through this
didn't go through
anyway let's hope let's go over to sscw
blogspot.com and we have SSA the
classified right here oh yes I almost
forgot about the one thing that you
started yapping about so since I
arguably won that debate because we kind
of like winning circles I arguably won
the
debate what we now have
is the sslw series and what she said
that she wanted them to date uh suu and
Damian which
is
absolutely absolutely ridiculous and
we'll show you why here on the screen so
hope you guys can see this on the screen
this is the SS ltw series we have Parts
one and two for this weand and the demin
right so there's gonna be a part three
where you stay down Damian face to face
in the
school so as you guys can see from this
image we got Eon Shay over here
concocting a plan with Summer G Cam's
New the facto leader with operation last
chance and um on on a cell phone right
essentially what happens here is that s
and her allies in gcam concoct a plan to
um
create a new scheme to take down
Damian um by using a fake text because
Damien was pressuring summer into
handing her number and Snapchat so that
he could take her all right and then
here is part two where SSA goes in and
starts chatting with Damian as well
connecting to the demin which obviously
you're of kemin um from room 16b to SS
to uh to the Dem anyway here's why that
would be a tail absolutely terrible idea
to allow them to date first of all as
you guys know gcam this is the post uh
jvn gcam Summit wall right and now with
sum coming into the school there's lots
of un instability within gcam gcam is
sliding gcam is faltering overend agency
right so it's kind of like you know when
the USSR collapsed right so you know
unfortunately the popularity levels
might be under 50% you know you're want
to have that over 50% right and then
Damian comes in here essentially Damien
with dating summer would obviously end
up as a crash and bur everyone knows
that right I mean statistically that's
what would happen all right which would
cause an invasion it would literally
that would be an invasion of jam and you
say well no no no no see look you wanted
to invade gcam yeah yeah well see I was
going to invade gcam for the good of SSA
and for the good of school right which
would have save the school right Damian
doing that would have exerted you know a
coldest um influence of 10th grade in
the basketball team over into gcams more
isolation Tendencies right and then they
would have been more Pro 10th grade for
like two minutes and then they break up
and then there's a war between 10th
grade and gcam right and of course gcam
is faltering jvn swoops in sees that as
an opportunity to destroy gcam once in
Fall Of course doesn't happen because
SSA comes in and is backed by uh and is
is gcam backed right SSA is gcam back of
course SSA as you guys can see in the
story right has limited communication
with their allies in gcam SSA um trying
to support gcam in the war but it
doesn't really go that well because
there's limited communication etc etc
and then it becomes like a three-state
solution where you have more power
that's kind of seated from G cam to jvn
then you have more power seated from of
course you know the president president
Allison to Damen who we wouldn't really
want to have power because it show SSA
weakness which CA them to collapse not
SSA to collapse but show SSA weakness
because we allowed the number to get
transferred we allowed the Snapchat to
get transferred we allowed the dating
things that get transferred and of
course you know Molly who's been
defeated right you know Valerie left so
whatever uh you know Molly's been
defeated who can come together and you
know start doing a whole bunch of weird
and random stuff so now and again
greatest greatest uh marketing strategy
of all time because I just got reposted
anyway um this this is the greatest
marketing strategy of all time you right
so uh christe dear is obviously
obviously an asset of Molly an asset of
Molly because that's what she wanted to
happen she wanted
chaos and we we we cannot have that so
anyway greatest marketing strategy of
all time asset of Molly etc etc all
right now let's get over to our Tech
commentary for today this is right
Damian and summer we had to prevent that
because is ssa's sworn dut our sworn
duty to abold the Constitution of the
school was our sworn duty to protect the
gcam we we would like essentially the
NATO of the school and we can not allow
that to happen now let's talk about one
more thing over in Tech world and that
is Livy who's I think a a Livy liby is a
um what what does she do again I forgot
oh gymnastics Post Yeah gymnastics Livy
and Paige spiranic
spiranic Paige spanic anyway um Paige
spanic who is a professional
golfer now you may wonder why I'm
talking about random
gymnasts and
golfers yeah on on on the Tech podcast
but that's because there's this platform
that they are on
uh let's see I I forgot what it's called
paage
spanic only
page let's she's on some website where
you can come and talk to her and you
have to pay her money to talk to her
actual money to talk to
it there appar of these
websites wait me let me see if I can
find her passes that's what it's called
passes so passes is a platform safe for
work okay it's not nothing elicit where
you can buy images of people you can buy
access to chat of people except
all you can access live streams direct
messages 203e direct messages 7even free
direct
messages maybe some direct messages
right you go through these
people and
um you you go to these people
right and you you pay her money $100 a
month to talk to it for like a 100
messages or 25 messages depending on
whatever payment you I think Livy does
this as well you can also pay for
pictures of as well which has got to be
seeing dearly the greatest business plan
of the entire
just
ever the greatest business plan of all
time and also the worst business
decision of all
time okay if people are that desperate
to talk to someone that they will pay
you a100 a month to get a set limit of
direct messages from you then I say for
all means by all means go set it up do
it but people why are you that desperate
first of all why why on Earth are you
paying for pictures wh why why why are
you paying for pictures of
someone
why okay now allow me to introduce you
to this great and powerful website that
is free so as an I end with an M
Instagram
Instagram you can find pictures of
people there you oh I don't know how to
do the searches or etc etc yeah um I'm
pretty sure you can figure out how to do
the searches you can I want to find
pretty people so pretty people I I don't
know how to do that search but whatever
figure it out right someone someone can
figure it out and maybe heck I'll sell
you that se I'll figure it out sell you
to se Tom for $50 great you got your SE
Tom you saved money and also Paige and
Livy guess what they also all do have
Instagrams as well so why are you paying
for pictures okay why utterly ridiculous
also paying someone money to talk to
you and you do realize that she's not
the you're not the only person who's
paying this Bing right if you were the
only person who paying this she'd be
broke right she wouldn't have any money
right $100 a month is not gonna be
enough to cut it you have hundreds maybe
even thousands of people I guess lonely
lonely friendless people who um don't
who who who apparently also very rich
who can afford to pay someone $100 a
month basically a years worth of Disney
plus a year worth of Disney Plus
to Yap to some girl who does not care
about them at all you I mean it's
impossible to care for a thousand people
at once you probably get their names
mixed up but this woman sit here and
especially with
chats especially with chats you don't
even know if they're true just not like
you're paying her for any like specific
Talent you're not paying her to learn
golf advice you're not paying her to
learn gymnast advice only a few people
are doing that no you're paying her to
talk to someone allow me to introduce
you to this great powerful and cheaper
application even if you pay St the chec
into the T called chat GPT which is a
website where you can chat with a
robot like like there there are these
applications called AI friend apps which
are cheaper than paying some woman
$10000 a month to Yap to her for 100 D
100 DMS you look I never ever had to pay
my allies in gkm to talk to me now sure
sure they didn't go dark they did go
quiet like over in this episode in this
story in uh the demin when I'm talking
to them trying to get more information
so I can find information about what's
going on with Summer and did they
transfer any information to me no but
look had I transferred them $100 would
they talk to me no look no they they're
busy they're doing important things that
don't involve me right that's that's
that's what they were doing right so no
matter how much I paid them they're not
GNA talk to me okay uh that that's
that's not how this works right um also
we'd run out of money very very quickly
as well and sure I may not have any real
like inp person friends that I can talk
to but I'm not that desperate that I'm
gonna Yap to some random golfer online
for
$100 like I'll just go say something in
Oculus over on X and then get yelled at
by bunch of anti-Semitic frogs that's
what I do with my free time right USA
didn't commit war crimes in World War II
apparently 37 million people uh didn't
like that like okay my goodness like bro
do you swear allegiance to Germany or
something
absolutely
ridiculous
it's sad it's said right and that's why
I go around and troll random people
Canadians on the internet and
uh get them to promote stuff and also
argue with them about crop
tops because obviously like we know we
use crop tops here as a political weapon
right
we yeah shame I couldn't be my studio
today because someone is taking a nap
anyway um so now let's get over to the
tech booy headlines for the articles
that no one's read right I got yelled at
30,000 times 30 30,000 people read my
post and like one post him was
like you you're stupid because I believe
in
creationism somehow again she got
featured in this
article anyway creationist unit aners
and Genesis releases an artificial
intelligence program to defeat evolution
of course the three years late I could
have used this when I was debating my
11th grade Rivals but no they had to
released this in 2025 but still it's
great I'm gonna actually go over to ERS
and genesis.com so you guys can see
this and org sorry so you guys can see
this chat program and action um there
should be some images
here uh so anyway this this doesn't
really do anything right it's all an
evolution it it it show it shows you
some parts on uh
like like you ask it why is evolution
bad you asking about radiocarbon dating
Etc I think I posted some images of um
of it right he gave you some pointers on
the essay I didn't really want to write
an essay for me but I I I could press it
into writing an essay it couldn't really
answer many questions outside of the
realm of science as well science
religion as well so I asked it who like
the president of the United States was
it couldn't tell tell me who that um was
so um it's only coded to do specific
things it does s things from anches and
Genesis let's see if I
can let's see if I can get the chat chat
chat up here on on the log but for
anything that's theologically gray like
crop tops man we keep yapping about crop
tops like here it is like a professor
asked about crop tops and where it
stands on modesty doesn't he gave me a
got question start running out doesn't
site got questions which it just doesn't
condemn doesn't condone so it's
obviously fine yes vote was obscured by
Foreign
interference anyway nonetheless I asked
about female pastes another Hot Topic
Christian issue nothing it just gave me
a well you know something something flip
flop flip flop uh I asked about the AG
of oath obviously 6,000 years old
finding Bible verses that would prove
about the age of the Earth obviously uh
6,000 years old so it doesn't solve any
gray areas on modesty women FAS or
Calvinism which is literally 90% of
religious debates over on X oh wow we
got a chat here does Jes yes yes yes he
does in fact we could actually go ask
the chat uh we could actually go ask the
chat there so useless
on useless use useless on cont
controversy except for evolution
everyone knows that evolution is false
evolution is is wrong right um so
that there it is and I'm so glad that
you know they brought this AI program
here I'm glad interest in Genesis has
embraced AI let's see if I can get this
AI to come up maybe I have like a pop-up
blocker that's off
um here is the next article from attch
boy of course you talked about the Telly
TV our first look you guys got to see
that on podcast last week so we're not
going to recap that but from finding
hacking tutorials to finding information
about trying to develop new technology
the internet is dead the web is dead
like I'm sitting around here arguing
with random people on the internet
instead of like actually innovating
anything so hope you got this is a clip
from a podcast this is also another clip
from the podcast spliced to together
right internet culture is so weird it's
so stupid right it's not filling with
anything in interesting right but we're
told that hacking is so easy a
12-year-old can do it them in fact we
hear that from all the expressvpn ads
all the time we problem is that
computers neutralized networking and
communication right but all we are
seeing now is Snapchat scams which I I
guess we can get into that no no offline
encyclopedia information that's locked
behind pay walls right you want an
offline encyclopedia it's kind of really
bad you have to use some Ty of weird
thing like you could get Inc for like
what a gigabyte 600 megabytes now it's
like really hard really really hard to
get even a 2004 encyclopedia just here
on the computer right because we're so
reliant on internet right um you could
get an encyclop on a CDM too bad right
you want a dedicate community that focus
on its interest instead of being
distracted by outset nonsense nope not
anymore right it has fallen so now you
can um I guess join not the boy you want
to be able to do things on the XP Vista
7 you can that you can't do on Windows
11 well too bad now because they
stripped it down they remove features
from it like I got Windows 11 post and I
can send messages across the network
you're able to do that for free on
Windows XP and dead 7 but not anymore on
Windows 11 right computers become
glorified web app consumption devices I
mean in fact when you look at the top uh
websites and then like sweat that
against the like websites like Google
YouTube Etc like the top websites are
going to be like canva etc etc um maybe
even Adobe right but even that has
become moded by the web we our computers
are so
reliant on the
web computers are Ser ring on the web
nowadays I mean
it's it's ridiculous like what do we
even have these things for if not to
ping some random server in Serbia
and yes that is alliteration I can do
that too Jasmine Crockett and those were
articles for the the the week so hope
you guys enjoyed those articles now
let's talk about the Galaxy
s25 slim Galaxy s25 slim I think it's
called s25 Edge I believe
s25 unfortunately no Edge screen I think
we should bring the edge screen back um
but let's see what we know about the
Galaxy s25 Edge here it is from Phone
Arena from only seven um hours
ago what we're seeing here is that it's
G to have a 200 megapixel main camera
and a 12 megapixel selfie camera but I
have not seen anything about a telephoto
zoom camera so it looks like that
Samsung's just going to go all on on
cropping for Zoom which I you know I
criticize Apple for I want to criticize
Samsung for this as well now I do know
this is like an experimental phone so
that's fine but hopefully doesn't get
transferred like you know he had the
experimental Galaxy z um full the
original legy fold right had no micro SD
card slap I was like everyone was going
to buy this anyway right they made a new
vers and they kept
iterating
um they kept iterating
right what was I going to say they they
they kept iterating right oh yeah but
then when S21 series rolled around they
remov the micro SD card slot absolutely
ridiculous absolutely ridiculous right
so I mean I I think it's really really
really sad what they did here so
hopefully Samsung doesn't start removing
the telephoto zoom lens especially from
the cheaper plus and regular series of
devices
um to to save money with like a 200
megapixel camera I me they've already
removed features from the Bluetooth uh s
pin over on the Galaxy s25 Ultra which
means my SP pin is more capable in this
phone than it is on the s25 ultra and
that's ridiculous absolutely
ridiculous and I think it's really sad
and it's unacceptable here in the
Android Community people with iPhones
can accept that but not people with
Android phones we should not accept that
we should never accept
that all right here you can see it's
going to have armor aluminum Wi-Fi
Bluetooth 7 I don't really understand
like what what what's like nothing
groundbreaking SP here you're not
curving the glass you're not putting
like a MicroSD CAD slap back on the
phone you're not trying out some type of
new camera technology right
it
like it is it's just
thin which your phone is not aosen
you're not trying to hug it okay and
people were going to put a case on this
anyway so does anyone really care about
being
skinny on on a phone like my case is
super duper thick and my phone is you
know skinny enough I I I would prefer
Samsung to invest their R&D on trying to
figure out if they can fit a MicroSD
card slot back into their
phones
it it should be better all right here
it's G to have no specs boost according
to Jeff
Springer um s25 Edge tip to be just 5.84
millimeters which this is United States
but inches but don't expect a major
specs boost which obviously I would
expect specs boost as well also how good
will The Thermals be and how good will
the battery life be on the s25 edge I
mean it's super duper skinny it's going
to save off 100 milliamp hour battery um
it's I don't think it's going to be
smaller I think it's going to be like 6
point 6 point uh five at least what's
the screen size um the the battels are
going to be Slimmer than on the s24
ultra which is fine I guess but you know
they they've already made so
many uh compromises let's see what the
screen size is it's not saying what the
screen size is let me see if I can find
it
here and I really on Samsung to start
innovating again the screen size
6.8 in is room it to be so it's gonna
have a 6.8 inch AMOLED display 120 HZ so
the same thing like about as big as the
s20 uh five Ultra with a battery 1,100
milliamp
smaller and it's skinnier so it's going
to have less heat uh heat syn less heat
distribution that
doeses not bod well and for the phone
that's probably going to be most like
the s25 plus it's bigger than that and
has a 600 milliamp battery smaller than
that what what is Samsung
thinking like the only phone that I can
think of that comes close to that would
be the Galaxy Z flip C
devices which has the advantage of
having a flipped cover screen which
means you can use a screen that's half
the size as the regular screen when you
need
to so it's only powering yeah you have a
smaller battery powering a fourth size
of the screen like you can send text
from there you can take your
selfies you can uh you can even play
some
games check your
email but you know if you if you really
need to you can open up your phone web
browse type out a longer
message also you know take some photos
and play you know actual video
games right so that makes sense and I
wish it was bit bigger on that phone as
well especially since the battery split
in half and just because of the laws of
physics when you split a battery in half
you take a 5,000 milliamp battery split
in half into 2,500 M 500 milliamps it's
not going to last as long right because
each battery is going to have its own
little
inefficiency inefficiency so one battery
is better than two right so they should
put maybe X to 100 milliamp hours into
the battery to offset that anyway you
know the phone splits in half hopefully
the
s244 Edge s25 Edge does not split in
half because if it splits in half then
you're not gonna have a phone but here's
Samsung's innovating Samsung's Galaxy
secret Android XR headset now people
were criticizing this video not this
video but the headset but being
too much like the Apple Vision Pro and
to that I say like what what do you
expect it to look like it's a pair of
glasses glasses look like glasses how
how how how how how you supposed to
innovate classes look they go on the
eyes you have two eyes you put them on
of course they're going to look
similar wait some some of these people
are just rapid anti-am Samsung people
and it shows it comes across when you
talk about a headset like a headset is
going to look like a headset you don't
people see people saying wait what why
why do these earbuds have two ear
holes why you plugging it in
there why why do these buds look look
the same as the other buds why do these
over ear headphones look like I mean
especially when you're molding something
for the body when you have slightly
above average number of eyes and legs
and feet and every hands and everything
right but most people have them you have
to accommodate for that like you don't
see people running around here being
like why do all the gloves look the
same wh why why do gloves look the
same no you you don't see
that oh we guys some comp this
is it playing
oh so Samsung has just recently started
teasing this unreleased prototype VR
headset
called until now so welcome to your
exclusive first this is the first look
of what what it can do also I really
wish that they focus more on classes and
not on headsets because I think these
headsets are be better suited for gaming
maybe using a desktop operating system
even though we don't even know what that
is for anymore like I said all these
computers are always being used for the
web
I I don't think people are going to be
using these right and Matt
Walsh I can't believe whatever I don't
think people were gonna be using these
it'd be better if you got glasses you
can see through them right they don't
need a big bulky heavy
battery first look and early impressions
of the very collaborative Samsung and
Google headset that looks a lot like a
Vision Pro actually want to take a step
back real quick though because like like
I said of course it looks a lot like
division Pro Look it's either rat or
glasses right and go to glasses rout so
of course it's going to look like
division Pro this isn't just a Vision
Pro look alike this is potentially a
huge step towards fixing the
fragmentation in the world of VR and
mixed reality headsets right now because
right now there's Vision Pro obviously
running Apple's Vision I think it's
interesting that you have these
fragmentations because it's like the
early days of smartphones we got these
different operating systems different
Force feature phones different operating
systems you can learn more about what
they run right like you if you look at
what kind of operating system smartphone
runs now you're going be Android or iOS
right but when you try to go find out
and this is another problem with the
internet you can't really find out what
these old systems are running like I
have a radio right it has a little
digital display it can play a CD what
operating system was that running how
how did it work you know just like
circuitry and something like some some
of these things are lost to time itself
right so I think that we should be
documenting this keeping it well
learning like how how do these people I
think it's really interesting how did
they code an entire oper new operating
system like because most of these phone
most most of these phone
um
people um are
trying like like the light phone it's
based off of a skin of Android right
they don't make their own operating
systems like the ghost phone it's
blocked interet they're something them
based off of Google pixels they just
took Chrome off the
device so
yeah there's the meta Quest running
Horizon OS and those major ones will
probably keep running those but then
there's the world of all the other
headsets out there and we just saw CES
there's I mean what headsets are you
talking about that that have activated
the market I mean CES they have flying
car there so that means nothing there
was a lot of other headsets around just
popping up left and right and what
software should they run so this is the
first Android XR headset so it's a
pretty deep collaboration between Google
probably been better if they kept their
phone powered headsets right our phones
are so powerful now right like they had
these running off of you know Galaxy S8
right allphones are so much more
powerful than the Galaxy S8 now which is
actually running Galaxy AI which is
which just goes to show how it's just
cloud-based right any any in fact the
Galaxy S1 I I challenge someone right
now to get Galaxy AI running on the
Galaxy S1 I'm pretty sure that's doable
and aart from it might be a bit slow it
will work right Samsung's AI Advantage
is only good because it's running off of
Samsung Cloud
servers right it's it's nothing has to
do on device Samsung is essentially
trying to sell phones that have like a
key to access their services for
free they're trying to sell software
that's sitting there on their
computers it would be impressive if
Galaxy AI could do those calculations on
device which they should be able to when
you get 12 16 on Galaxy S21 uh Ultra
gigabytes of RAM you
got oodles and oodles of storage that
you can be use put putting this on
people just using these machines to talk
text and look up different favorite
websites Instagram X Snapchat
Etc and only a few people like Livy and
um paid spanic are actually making money
off of it I don't make money talking to
people right I probably would have to
pay to talk to me right no one's paying
me money to talk to
them and in fact people pay me more
money to shut up than they went to talk
to
them right I'm I'm probably an annoying
person like no no no one actually like
like 90% of comments over here on X is
just shut up go home sit down right I
mean it even when you look at Po's ultr
me 80% of people think I'm stupid so you
know I pr of these people would pay me
money you shut up they they they they
would be like he never exist deleted his
account they they would they would be
lining up they would line up and pay me
money
right and Samsung think of it as like
the Nexus or pixel but for headsets it's
a huge Baseline amount of software it's
an OS with tons of features that give it
a really high Baseline for functionality
and then some example Hardware to show
it all off on now again this is
technically an unfinished prototype that
they're showing me so they could still
have a few tweaks and things that they
changed before the end but Samsung has
also made it very clear that it's
intending on shipping it this year so I
feel pretty good about evaluating what
they've put in front of me and it's
honestly pretty solid does it look like
a Vision Pro from the front yes of
course I mean it's got the light colored
Fabrics obviously it's got the huge
reflection I mean if it was like dark
like black people might be like
that's not good that that that's scary
it's
dystopian you know so I think having
light colored Fabrics
would would be better glass piece at the
front although there is no screen
showing your eyes on the outside so
that's a nice difference I actually
posted this on Twitter and half of the
comments were like oh you're making
another Vision Pro video because it just
looks so similar the way the removable
forehead rests looks is definitely
inspired and there's also another
removable magnetic light Shield that you
can easily drop in the bottom to block
out more light or keep it off for more
peripheral vision but then the back
borrows more from the now discontinued
Quest Pro what what is it actually
boring like it's a headband that goes on
your head where where else are you going
to put it we gonna suspend it from the
sky like that works on Commercial VR
that I've played with before that's not
going to work on you know personal VR
that's supposed to be know walk around
sit down
in I would say with the sort of cup on
the back of your head plus a dial to
adjust how snug it is I found out with
this setup basically most of the weight
or the pressure now is on my brow above
my eyes unlike with the Vision Pro was
more below my eyes because of the way it
sort of sagged so I thought I might like
an over thehead strap option two at
first but actually don't think this
one's going to need it so then this thin
metallic frame at the front has all the
computer guts in it it has the
Snapdragon chip it has these fans with
exhaust holes at the top like you can
see there's a single button at the top
right and a volume rocker at the top
left and there's it's good like machine
design right there sensors and cameras
all the way around facing all directions
and there's even a touchpad on the right
side strap right where this raised bar
is right here and then there's even one
more thing that you might have noticed
that they copied from Vision Pro which
is the external battery pack on a cable
makes sense no Samsung's been scared to
have good big batteries on their phones
ever since the Galaxy Note 7 Rest In
Peace So they probably don't want these
blowing up on people's faces well that
goes into your back pocket but there is
one pretty key difference here so
connects to the headset with a removable
battery like apples it has a decently
long braided cable like apples and
relatively small first-party battery
just like apples but unlike div Vision
Pro this cable on the battery side is
removable and it's it's just USB type-c
so you can use this included battery
which has a more secure fit obviously
but if you want to plug in a bigger
battery or whatever other battery you
own then you can do that too so of
course that means third party developers
can come in they can get those
dimensions and make their own big
battery packs as well I wonder if you
could plug that into like a laptop a uh
a PC maybe your
phone
uh maybe even the wall if someone could
figure that out thank you but I've
actually come away from this experience
not really thinking that much about the
actual Hardware because that's not
actually what makes this headset so cool
it's Android XR think of it this way if
you are uh Google and Samsung and you're
trying to put together the pixel of
headsets and you want to give people an
actual reason to buy it over a Vision
Pro for example what do you do what's
your move hint it's the exact same move
that they use for the pixel software so
a lot of the basics a lot of the
fundamentals are going to be the same
right there's a home menu which has a
scroll and these are some of the saddest
apps
Gmail Google
messages with of all your apps plus some
quickly accessible settings and recent
apps and then that F manager Samsung
does software better than Google hot
take instead of a digital Crown you can
always go home by hitting the top button
once or do this handtrack gesture to
quickly get back there and yes there is
both hand tracking and ey tracking in
this headset at no point during this
demo did I use any controllers although
I do believe it'll support controllers
might even come with some controllers in
the Box don't know that yet uh but this
was a very easy headset to just set up
put it on and just use it and I think
also will be super easy to share so if I
just wanted to hand it to someone and
they want to see what I see they put it
on all they really have to do is hold
down that that one button and it'll line
up the lenses to match their eye
distance and then they're Off to the
Races so you're messing around using
this thing these windows have these
really large handles underneath them or
you have some tabs on here of course
Chrome above them to grab them and move
them around in 3D space you can also
grab any corner to resize a window to
basically any aspect ratio you want and
then since it's the Android headset it
has two main things going for it one is
the Play Store that's great I'm glad
that it supports like like he says any
application wow 27 people actually
watching this so I wonder
if uh Wonder would you guys pay me to
shut up and two is Gemini so first of
all all Play Store apps will work on
this Android XR I wonder how good it is
at video editing like this chip has got
to be more powerful than the chips they
put in phones because you know it's said
window and scale all this things window
things in real time this has got to be a
beast at video everything so that
includes phone apps and tablet apps
matter of fact these apps seem to
respond well to me changing them to
literally whatever aspect ratio and size
I want I was kind of trying to break it
and it seemed fine the whole time so the
idea is that any headset that runs
Android XR right out the box will have
the same Advantage tons of apps
available
and then there's also spatial apps
specifically which are built for
headsets and are fully optimized so
YouTube for example they have a spatial
app for it this wasn't as eager to let
me change aspect ratios but the whole
app has this more specifically multi-
window experience and lets you add an
immersive background at any time if you
want to similar to certain nice Pro apps
having their own built-in environments
and then also the headset always seem to
play nice with peripherals so moving
quickly between this random Bluetooth
keyboard and mouse and hand controls was
pretty seamless so I love that even more
but hear me out the Gemini integration
was actually the most interesting part
to me and it might not even be for the
reason that you're expecting but I I
think it was really cool so at any point
you can just go home and and hit the
Gemini button and just talk to it
basically it starts running an instance
of Gemini live in the background you
know the live conversational version of
it's the exact same thing I don't know
why he's acting like it's an instance of
Gemini live it makes it sound like as a
coding type of thing that you can sort
of talk back and forth with and on a
full conversation with it does hey guys
guys also Gemini live is free also by
the way right um so it would be better
to pay Gemini live than talk to paage
spenic okay so um Gemini live is free
paid [ __ ] get a $100 talk to Gemini live
does that in the headset and also Gemini
is multimodal which in the headset
holding an Ultra by the way uh that LIF
the co edges means that it can see
everything that you're seeing so you can
ask Gemini about something that's just
in front of you and it can give you
answers just like as if you'd taken a
picture of it with your phone so it can
translate signs or answer trivia
questions or just tell you about what
you're looking at Etc can you take me to
here sure that looks like wty rum in
Jordan
that's interesting it kind of reminds me
of like the imagination
station let me think like yeah you could
point at a place in a book and it would
take you oh no that's the Magic Tree
House but mad Mason station had this
thing where you could like scan in books
and then it would create an adventure
for you
so that's that's nice we have that going
for us one update I would like is for it
to be able to subscribe to YouTube
channels and like videos but doesn't
seem to be able to do that yet so you
have to do it with your mouse and
keyboard who so that was cool but Gemini
can also navigate the UI for you so it
was able to move around windows organize
my windows for me close a bunch of
Windows and then it can actually move
around inside of apps I believe this
would just work with spatial apps but I
was having a lot of fun messing around
inside of Google Maps and just jumping
around to different places just by
talking to Gemini and then occas system
that sometimes R in G kind of sad that
they forgot all about go resistant
selecting things with a pinch and Gemini
would know how to search for things it
would know how to use a search box it
would find things in maps switch the UI
from street view to the zoomed out view
it could do all of this SL like what do
this lag come on get moving voice and
that saves a ton of moving my hands
through the air to the point where it
was pretty significant hey Gemini take
me to the South Mountain reservation
I can do
that and then there's also builtin
Circle to search in real life it was a
little buggy when I was playing with it
but the idea is really cool still so if
you hold down the top right button on
the headset it plays a little animation
and then you can pinch your fingers
together and just circle in real life
whatever you want to search that pops up
a window exactly the way it would on an
Android phone and Google searches that
thing and it's so sick when it works it
seems so obvious for a Google headset
but yeah I'm glad it's actually here now
it is still Gemini which is to say it's
not perfect I mean Google lens is on
Android phones too so I would expect
this I acting like Circle search is such
a great thing you could always search on
what your screen was but it is a nice
little shortcut it's it's still lacking
a little bit of functionality from
Google assistant right and there's a I
talked about bugs like there's a awkward
bug where if you Circle to search but
then your hand is in the circle it takes
a screenshot of your hand and searches
that so they got to figure out a way to
instruct people to circle the right way
but this is still a massive difference
versus The Vision Pro which has no apple
intelligence features no AI features at
all and probably won't be getting any
anytime soon it looks like and I just
feel like using these headsets for a
long period of time I've noticed there
is a good amount of fatigue which that's
why I think we to do the glasses ju back
no think it's to do the glasses and also
provide more outlets right they they
would be tons cheaper two 200 maybe $300
right I think xville has one let's go
look at these XR um glasses they'd be
tons cheaper um because they provide the
offer the processing power in the
battery to the phone 599 here we go $197
on
Amazon um so it's either this guys or
your stickers what do what do you guys
want XR AR glasses
or scam stickers anyway XR AR glasses
plug them in they work with anything
right there's no operating
system you plug them in you can game you
can use decks or mod World ready for um
you can watch movies on it because like
people AR gonna even work like typing up
I don't know what kind of computery work
that people still do nowadays but I mean
it's comp compatible with the iPhone uh
with USBC it's compatible with the
Android phones compatible Windows
MacBooks right it shares your screen
with them and you can then
see you you you can then see
uh
what what
um what you're doing there on Native
developed devices even even the on
that's $599 that's still half maybe even
three times more less expensive I mean
Apple verion prob was
$3,000
$3,000 let me say this again
$3,000 that's how much the Apple Vision
Pro
is XV 200
$600 tons tons
cheaper and it's going to be using the
native processing power of your device
and Native battery of your device the
device that you already own right no has
an apple V Pro that doesn't have an
iPhone in fact you need an iPhone to set
it up right I presume that you're going
to need one to set this up as as well
and even if you don't if you're able to
afford a, $2,000 headset then you
obviously you have a phone but you can
afford a phone right this is gonna be
like some type of phone alternative for
you know people who can't afford phones
or
whatever this this device is going to be
a very very expensive device two three
you know th thousands and thousands of
dollars let me show this back on to the
screen right so it it' be much cheaper
and better if they just offloaded the
processing power and the battery to the
phones they already sell and they could
didn't Market that as saying hey Al look
we um we can do this with our phones and
that's why you have 12 gigabytes of RAM
in a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip from the
tiny you know touch targets and the
pinching and just moving your arm around
a lot it's a it's a small thing but it's
a lot more than a mouse and keyboard
there's just a lot more arm movements
and so I found that the fact that I
could minimize that by just talking to
the headset was surprisingly high on my
list of useful features hey Gemini my
windows are kind of a mess can you
organiz
them I can help with
that so my takeaways from my couple
hours here you know I could judge things
like display quality and field of view
which were both fine by the way not
remarkable it had pretty good sharpness
much better than it looked it's probably
gonna be a bit cheaper because know
everyone lodg the Apple person CL
display of course I went hands- on with
it before I did the 20 minute demo uh in
the Apple
Store and you know display quality it
didn't look good to me it didn't look
good looks in my screen recordings I can
tell you that just a notch behind Vision
Pro but also these things could all
change a little bit by the time the
final headset comes out I also like the
hardware design I like that you can
easily remove this light shield and keep
some peripheral vision and some light
coming in from the rest of the room
around you it just subconsciously made
it feel slightly more like glasses even
though they're obviously not glasses but
overall it's almost been more
fascinating to see what Google is doing
at a software level with their which I
think it's going to be interesting I
really think that this Hardware is going
to be a bit cheaper like $2,000 instead
of you know $3,000 but still it's very
expensive hopefully they can get these
things to work
well and um hopefully goodbye God bless
and hopefully chrisy we can keep doing
ad campaigns together where I promote
stuff and you argue back and none of us
make money</pre>
