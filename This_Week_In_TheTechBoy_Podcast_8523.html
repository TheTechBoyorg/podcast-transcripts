<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 8523</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
hello and hello everybody and welcome to
the this week in the tech boy podcast
um let me share this first
and then we're going to get right into
it we have plenty of uh
things to talk about uh we've got some
uh let's do the Banning some tech
technical uh thingies
here we go
um
five
um AI can now read your brain apparently
uh oh there's some type of protest by
this guy named Kai senet
it's uh
a piece apparently a game streamer I've
heard of him like one time
um one time that AI Google bought it
like back in March thought it was me
um
yeah
and he's like got arrested or something
here we go
into our first story of the week coming
from the tech boy Bridge recently got to
interview the CEO of copper not Cooper
kapu jungle uh hopefully you can see
this on the screen share it share tab
a jungle CEO
of course come in and chat copper jungle
CEO uh Nelson R Elliott how to fix that
title I'll fix that
um and his website is linked here
um it's copperjungle.net copperjongo.net
and he's a children who write Tech
positive stories and I wanted to sit
down and talk to him um over here so
I have some interesting questions and he
actually talks about how to use this
Tech in his day-to-day life because I'm
interested in how people use Tech
outside of tech blogging and tech
reviews and he uses um
not Adobe uh something else affinity
you guys know Infinity they're the
one-time payment
um platform instead of
descriptions
um
and this article has been really popular
over on sweet tricks I checked this
money got 20 views and that's really
good
um finally we have a decent article
up here
today and on my Blogspot set which of
course are inaccurate most of the time
um because it's like 100 something but
that's usually a good sign and it's even
in the top five one two three one two
three four five I don't know how it
works two of my articles actually from
this week how to share Instagram
excuse me uh followers for mini account
free so that's good it's a Chrome
extension
um I'll show it to you on the screen
hopefully you guys can see it
um
yeah if I have to stop the screen and
presented again
so yeah that's weird but here's my
column extension tab
and it's in this tool so if you can see
it it's just called ins tools
all right there you go ins tools
um tells you about that stop sharing all
right let's get into our next tech story
from not the B
um I'm going to share it on the screen
with you
oh my gosh you have to see this headline
um
here we go
um this is we're not talking about this
toy but I just popped up an 87 year old
woman brought off a pantsless teen who
broke into her home and attacked us he
didn't distracted him of snacks what's
he called the police
police that's shocking all right but on
to the real story talking about uh the
oh that's the case in that thinking but
the AI
um
AI that can basically read your mind and
based off of brain waves I know what it
sounds like some of your Odyssey fans
out there sounds like an overcome but
it's not
um you can
recreate oh wow you can recreate the
music people are listening to doing
brain scans that's interesting I also
brings up copyright content but um next
thing this is called brain just music
about books by analyzing brain and
imaging data from people who are
listening to music people scientists say
that in Newport brings music to help us
develop music that the symbols the
resembles the musical simulator human
topics experience so if no idea music is
more less complex than talking
especially music nowadays
kind of repetitive and beats also
repetitive
um
so you can read people's brain waves and
figure out their music
um this could probably be Advanced to
figuring out what people are saying
which would be interesting because then
you could just import security camera
footage
or something I don't know
brainwave
generated music
well we can listen to it right now
okay it's on GitHub
to listen to music okay
oh
that sounds decent I mean it doesn't
sound like something that alien would
say oh I hope you could hear that
because I was on the other town
um tell me in the chat if you can if you
could have if
I remember we're celebrating our three
year anniversary
um according to who is data we brought
the domain name the tech boy.org
um four days from now but their website
was founded on the
30th well 29th but the first day the
first post was like the 30th so
all right this this guy has a bunch of
other artificial intelligence he's like
the taco board of it
it's loading
okay okay
oh I forgot a Cyber attack disrupt
Hospital service
um in five states just forcing emergency
room services to close which is not good
no point out which is also another
reason
electric cars you gotta get that cyber
grade first before we endorse um that
and we'll be talking about electric cars
they do because chat gpgs are kind of
crazy oh and I also talked to someone
that we're going to test uh GPT for
communism
um so hopefully he's watching this and
why isn't watching this [ __ ]
um let me see if I didn't share this
okay I told people in life nephew thing
no views is everyone sleep or something
oh go anyway
um yeah we'll talk about chat gbt and
electric cars and everything like that
once we get a person in here come on
where are you guys
let me see
oh wait I don't want to show that okay
um
but on another more serious
um note okay not that serious um
incandescent light bulbs are banned from
being sold in the US now
which is kind of sad
um England has some light bulbs
apparently give off something nice
glow instead of but they're not as power
efficient and I just think it's like
come on why would you just be in a light
bulb get it get a hold of yourselves but
but it's not that it's not okay
um but you can use LEDs which is what we
have in here I think that's another
being here
eliminating my face and then the blue
light you see it's also an LED
controlled by this
this remote
so that's the thing uh interview had a
story about this
so let's see
oh I forgot to talk about that where
we're called thinking we'll talk about
that after we talk about the
a goodness there's a lot of audibles
was thinking that's what I'm thinking
maybe that was like two days ago
there it is August 2nd 2025 three days
ago as a recording
incandescent light bulbs are banned I
have to spill 16 years in the making
which means they've been trying since I
was born I guess
um
so bulbs have to illuminate 45 lumens
per watt you can't have anything lower
than that it's illegal here in the
United States
to fight a carbon change in climate
sorry climate change or carbon emissions
in global warming one light bulb at a
time
um speaking of light bulbs uh we are
getting a news report saying
something about light bulbs or something
here
um let me check it out
oh here it is according to recent news
reports hopefully you can see this on
screen uh
the FBI is sent in a heavily armed
Tactical Team of
okay the FAA I think in heavily or a
Tactical Team to unscrew an incandescent
light bulb
um in Birmingham Alabama please stand by
the Portugal come in from today's uh
walkie-talkie
[Music]
it has been successfully unplugged
produce reports and explore Flex yeah
next video and of course I hope you guys
know whatever so obviously the FBI
didn't see the team and why is no one
here where are you guys come on we
celebrated oh oh speaking guys
um we're still selling our TCL 40xl
220 on eBay
basically Brandon
okay let me see if any runs but cute
just saying
usually I have someone in here but he's
watching not even chatting but the thing
says that no one's watching it has zero
people here
wait I got someone's supposed to be
me
probably gonna have a nice long story
hopefully and it's right link
okay here we go
and back on ntp again
stop sailing I'm going to share this
again David agency
anyway I'm live hopefully you guys are
hearing this and watching this uh very
exciting stuff here
um we'll probably talk about that app
next time but let's get into some
reaction content then we'll go and get
into some communist Church EPT and then
we'll find out what kind of insane
things Church GPT is asking me to do to
win a school Direction because obviously
Church GPT is not in touch but chat gbt
as of 2021 doesn't know what this is so
that's good at least doesn't speak for
gin Ting
um
I'm not good with Fortune uh z
um but today we're going to be reacting
to Mr who's the boss he gave us 60 facts
about himself and
we're going to react to it you know we
might try to emulate what he does
remember emulate what he does already
apparently his uh wife to be dresser is
his employee so that's nice
nice husband and wife team
and here we go construct the video
oh and photos
shut up
for those of you wondering Monica is
an AI assistant hi
how do we make these videos who is on
the Mr who's the boss team what do we
actually do with all the tech that we
buy I get a lot of questions
do you actually speak wonderful where
are your parents from buddy do you use
Motorola what do you eat for breakfast
well if you do a photo's laptops of
fulfillment
why does the thing have no replies
how much mail do you have are you still
living in your parents home really light
where does he keep all those phones at
school the car looks scooter car looks
really cool this is yours
come on come on in where are you it's 14
minutes into the podcast it'll be a
YouTuber do you like onions your
drumming was good so here are the 60
most surprising things that I've never
told you before my biggest fears are
spiders and Heights this is what happens
if you put me in a fighter jet oh
in that video he almost
said a bad word
YouTube is not the first business I've
ever ran when I was 12 I set up my first
online store I'd buy toys in bulk from
China for a discount and then sell them
individually on eBay and then every time
I'd
smart so we start doing that do you want
to see the tech toys
sell out my stock I'd place an even
bigger order and get an even better
price per unit and this is not even the
First Youtube channel I've set up before
Tech I was really into animation I'd see
people making all these really cool
stick figure fight sequences and I tried
to make my own on my little HP laptop
keyword being tried
and it's not good
oh he said I'll link that channel is
anyone I got to 14 and my brother bought
me my first ever smartphone funny enough
using his first ever paycheck that I
just fell in love with it and realized
how passionate I was about
it's pretty modern design ideas nice
that's when this Channel and everything
else actually kicked off which is a good
reminder to not expect that's when this
Channel and everything else is actually
which is a good reminder to not expect
things to work out on your first stab at
them and then the first product that I
ever got for free to test was about a
year and a half after that it was an
Android Tablet from the company anal
which was very careful not to
mispronounce
I get a lot of questions about my family
so my mom came to the UK from India when
she was 15 and it was very tough right
like you had to do your exams you have
to do your degree in a language you
didn't really get it while juggling a
job so you could afford to stay there so
mum what's your fact oh my God it's not
just about your mother to a very gifted
child
so mum what's your fact my fact is I'm
just proud to be mother to a very gifted
child it's of the Stream it's lovely
thank you
and my dad came from Leicester I think
he's playing chess which if you know the
UK is basically just India again okay so
Dad tell everyone a fact about you I'm
passionate fencing is that why there's a
sword in your office yeah it kind of
helps me Focus how
he seems like a nice man
[Music]
textbook dad joke really isn't it my
biggest pet peeve is when people don't
bring their charges with them when they
go places on the bright side I carry
like three power Banks and probably like
nine cables wherever I go well
with the EU now just USBC so
was it USBC
I fidget but when I fidget I don't bite
my nails or pull my hair I just keep
flipping my phone in the air I just like
throwing a bunch of gold bars around
that is a thousand two hundred this is
what if I could flip this
don't throw it as I can get my brain has
zero idea I'm doing it and it seems to
put everyone around me in a persistent
state of anxiousness I mean the way I
see it this is an ongoing durability
test I am oh let me show you my new
phones uh black screen so I added a
widget to my lock screen and this nice
new clock oh it actually sells the
battery percentage right there so
there's the widget
oh
let me
go
so there's the clock
and there's the Google widget and you
still have access to your regular
widgets
see the voice recorded
and if you want to access the Google
widget you may think oh no it's locked
but nope
it is I mean it is locked so no one can
like type in anything but it'll take you
straight directly to the Google
application then come on in guys it's

[Music]
um
and don't forget to add in
uh five dollars to my buy me a coffee
um
I'm sharing a kid I want to have five
people in the chat five people in the
chat by the end of this video
so here we go I'm working right now my
favorite snack is always cereal It's Not
Unusual for me to have like three bowls
in a day obviously cereal goes in first
milk seconds no it's not true who puts
milk in their cereal you'll get wet
cereal just yeah
I'm not a psychopath before we had
WhatsApp and iMessage whenever someone
would text me with something that didn't
specifically need replying to like I'll
pick you up from the station I used to
just reply to them with the word scene
which in hindsight I probably could have
just said thanks can I clearly just say
okay it teaches at school used to find
me really annoying not because I used to
mess around but was in any way cool but
because I used to ask questions about
everything I didn't stop asking
questions until I understood the topic
from every single possible angle you
could look at it from and I guess that's
kind of the feeling that I try to give
you when you watch our videos now
so could you tell me the speed of a
micro SD card head slot in a Galaxy S6
question there is none the entire base
of operations for literally everything
we do is my old bedroom in my parents
house it's kind of funny because
I wonder if that doesn't even
does he have his own house
because I must get annoying sometimes
we've had like Tech CEOs come over news
reporters and every single person walks
into this room takes a look around and
it's just like this isn't it right the
room only has 12 square meters of usable
space
square meters oh square meters that's
like I've never heard someone actually
say square meters before it's always
square feet
a meter is about three feet so I'll be
about 36 square feet
what are they doing up here
is this the air conditioning I guess
but I love it it's the perfect example
of just work with what you have for
meters of the world's biggest smartphone
December 2020 usable space but I love it
it's the perfect example of just work
with what you have fancy studios are fun
but you don't need it so when we film
our videos I sit here and Josh over
there basically moves between each of
these two seats to get to the two
secondary angles the problem is there
isn't enough space to navigate so once
every three videos we knock the camera
sorry and it takes us a full 30 minutes
to get it lined up so everything's
symmetrical again
oh my gosh you're actually properly
built for shocker
wow
oh guys look at the same phone with a
different hint
[Music]
actually now's a good time to meet
those is that like selfie front facing
the team they are all here we need a
bigger room so this is Josh he does most
of the filming you hold yourself to a
very high standard right you like every
shot to have meaning Josh and I do a lot
of late nights together as well we get
excited about certain video Concepts we
decide they need to go out soon and we
don't sleep till they're done ghost from
is
proposal video Josh is showing me his
fact now are you looking for Milo he
said Josh's factors about how much Milo
loves him and he can't find Milo
he's not here Josh so then this Joe is
who is the first person I ever hired and
you've actually taught me a lot about
what that's nice
just kidding looks good in a video and
what doesn't because I could not edit
before you started my fact is Barack
Obama follows me on is it well Twitter
or x what do you want to call it wait
wow to be on his birthday too
Barack Obama
I I don't know why
oh wow
today
according to the radio which means did
he film this today
anyway
uh why does he follow I almost
half a million people
that's insane
follows 553 000 people yeah
yeah
he's not responding to my DM though
big fan of you
foreign
then there is Alex who is the most
technically proficient person I know I
feel like you use scientific methods to
calculate like the perfect color grade
for each scene we also are pretty
convinced you work for some sort of
Secret Agency
I'm not going to say anything about that
what I wonder how like color green looks
like I wonder whether it does like I
know it kind of changes to covers it but
how much how helpful did
laptop
let me see
we're gonna go uh frame by frame
it's going to improve the quality of
so turn DaVinci Resolve 100 smartphone
tips and tricks Cuts copy okay
he clicks the workspace icon
and he Scrolls down
to
Scripts
and then he clicks
oh no
AI editing video
we're gonna see if this is my car
because eventually resolve
and then he clicks so maybe he didn't
make the script I think this is
something built into DaVinci Resolve
I'll have to look into it um right after
this no no what have you done this
already
so then there's Mark who is a very funny
guy edits a lot of the more Whimsical
videos lots of fact about you I hate
myself in a video of you guys edits a
lot of them it looks like
an episode of Blue's Clues more
Whimsical videos lots of fact about you
I hate myself in the video you hid
yourself yeah I made myself look really
old was that you I thought it was your
dad now I mean he left to work
so that is the long form video to you
but there's more people that we need to
make sure that all the other stuff
happens for example Connor so Connor is
a writer and researcher you've spent a
lot of time looking for a lot of the
weirder products that we feature in our
videos yes I've been very desensitized
so if he looks for them
who does the looking for them like on
stream he looks for himself
so is that just fake is it acting to the
internet what's the fact about you I
play the diatonic button accordion
and that is
so then there's Jack who is shorts
master so he
I do feel like shorts mastered today but
Jack is insane like he plans the shorts
he comes and films the shorts he takes
the shorts away he cuts them he edits
them it is a lot for one person so
what's your fact
I am the cookie Master no you've been
saving those ah it's still on the Box
Cookies this is not free
all right
just coming to Josh
um Jack brought cookies he was hiding
them this whole time
we actually have something very special
for Jack that we're just about to give
him now we've just worked out that Jack
himself because he owns shorts has
managed to get us a total of 10 million
subscribers between our shorts he used
to change that logo
iffy his channel and our main Channel
Jack we have something for you so this
was the entire team's idea because
funnily enough the shorts Channel
combined with the main Channel
has just hit 10 million subscribers this
is heavy our way of saying thank you
it's amazing I never thought I would
wait it comes in its own YouTube case
wow and I get one of these
smash sticker he smashed it
and then the person who keeps it all
together oh I just I just swiped you
there
so Joseph is our everything man we want
to book a location for a video he's on
it
so he's like the little AI but
I in that AI
start a fire so we can test the fire
extinguishers
what's the fact about you in my first
week I was fantastic to go to North
Carolina to film Mr Beast there's like a
b cam secondary cameraman so if you
didn't like that video Ohio was shot I'm
sorry that was like our best performing
video ever
did a good job
[Applause]
[Music]
I didn't spend any money from this
channel buying fancy clothes or fancy
cars for myself I actually don't even
own a car literally all of my top 10
biggest expenses
these have just been on things for
either this Channel or family but
hypothetically my dream car would be the
Lotus Evita it just looks wow
wow like a spaceship it's insane one of
my favorite things to do if I get a
weekend off is
very weird it's process refinement so
I'll look at things that me or someone
in my family currently does and think
how do we make this more efficient like
I just recently realized how much time
it takes to move the lawn at my parents
house so I managed to find an automatic
gardening robot that can do it for them
or like am I in law's house seeing how
much time that they would spend
de-weeding their Garden I decided to
just kill the weeds once cover the mud
with a plastic sheep so they don't grow
back and then turn it into a zen-like
stone feature I find it really
satisfying to put in a little bit of
short-term effort to save a lot of
long-term effort that's nice do you guys
like robot
lawn mowers
but there are a few things that I do
like to get for myself like my guilty
pleasure is probably my Pokemon card
collection I've always loved Pokemon and
so when you combine my attachments to
the brand with this lottery ticket like
feeling you get every single time you
open a new pack it's hard to say no I'm
actually going to Japan later this year
mostly just to go to Pokemon stores and
Pokemon cafes and then aside from
Pokemon cafe cards I'm also just really
into gaming
it's like our 15th attempt I was so
passionate about consoles and games that
really that was most of my content when
I first started this channel after the
consoles I then spent a long time
covering exclusively phones like just
back to back to back phone videos and
only recently thought I feel like it's
best videos
got the editing format down the voice
over everything but what if we just test
it again it couldn't just be any gaming
video of course it had to be Mr who's
the boss quality which meant that I
decided to buy every single PlayStation
brand new as well as a TV from the time
of eton's launch I filmed the entire
history and the joy it brought me to see
that people loved 100 000 17 million
people watch that video Unfortunately
they didn't all subscribe
that video so much that I love too was
incredible my actual favorite drink
wait is that Bixby
oh yeah that Samsung design right there
it's a thick chocolate milkshake but
ever since I did the whole Fitness
transformation thing last year we subbed
those out for kombucha and ginger ale
that's kind of funny I buy them in
industrial size batches now which Ginger
here my recent obsession is board games
specifically Seven Wonders Katan and
Ticket to Ride they're all actually
strategy games which says something
about me
my favorite console of all time is the
PSP my favorite game on edge and the one
I've sung the most hours into is Monster
Hunter Freedom Unite I try not to think
about what this works out to in days but
I do remember being quite surprised to
learn that my playtime did pass a
thousand hours one thousand hours
divided by 24
hours in a day
what happened
oh no I think I restore it okay I'm
gonna move back over here gonna get my
calculator I'm gonna divide
foreign
41 days
and
I'm just trying to share this because no
one's here I I don't get it I've been
streaming for almost 40 minutes and then
my favorite phone game by far is Bloons
Tower Defense six I always loved the
strategy that you get with Tower Defense
games the idea of being the decision
maker positioning and upgrading your
forces in the most tactically
advantageous way I actually like it so
much that most of the videos I watch on
YouTube to relax myself are videos about
this balloons game that I play which may
sound really weird and sad but everyone
has their niches right if I wasn't a
YouTuber I'd probably be an artist to
spend days sitting in fields with my
fiance Trisha painting what I see
it's a good day
you're right here so Trisha it's got the
most important question out of the way
offenders I have an iPhone 13 Pro what
does that mean yeah that's you I
actually convinced you to get an iPhone
as well ah shame
shame anyways
future wife I'm getting an iPhone
okay she's right we got engaged on the
6th of February 2023. it was a pretty
fun video go watch it if you haven't
what was it like it was the most
unbelievable
oh
unreal surreal insane
see
having quantities of sugars oh thanks
that surrealism is
okay no what
oh my gosh
let's see after next
okay so a similar would be unreal so I
guess you can be unreal and cereal
bizarre unusual weird
experiences of her life
um
day of my life how many times have we
watched the video back okay
together we are half of those views
we watched that two and a half million
sometimes if I want to make her
emotional I just play the song that I
played at the end of them but
probably the biggest bit of news is that
drisha has left her job to join us
ah so he used to work at the BBC yeah
like paper
was he just gonna be like a volunteer
now because now to take me to tick tock
now you work for Mr he's the boss on
YouTube yeah made it round the media
world you're kind of like a media Mogul
does he went from BBC tick tock to Mr
Boss I take that we recently did a
spreadsheet and we tossed it up how many
hours I've been working on a week it
came to 90. too many hours you're the
big picture creative genius Vision 20
hours a week
I'm the detail organization love a
spreadsheet because I've been working on
a week a medium Mogul I'll take that we
recently just okay let's see
doing posting videos and doing SEO three
hours
giving feedback and how emails three
hour sponsor approvals and back and
forth only two hours okay
scripting sponsor segments oh wait he
scripts them
okay creating video Concepts one hour
thumbnail descriptions
do we how was your thumbnail
it takes me like 30 minutes in campus
weekly weekly night media calls one hour
product expansion strategy oh for making
merch courses four hours accounting
three hours team reviews tracking stack
performance and holidays
half an hour for team reviews
well it's the Bible we like 18 hours for
filming takes 18 hours because
in a spreadsheet and we tossed this is
almost 18 minutes
and no one's here
it's kind of depressing y'all set up how
many hours I've been working in a week
it came to 90. too many hours you're the
big picture creative genius Vision
I'm the detail organization love a
spreadsheet and now you're on the team
what's your fact it's gonna be
controversial but for me it is clearly
milk before cereal
this was trying to make the most sense
here
why would you put the milk in before the
cereal it's gonna Splash up when you put
the ceiling on
duh
okay
you should be putting milk and cereal
but if you are going to commit such a
crime you might as well do it
the most physically thank you to viewer
number one thank you for coming thank
you thank you so much
um please leave a comment in
um if you're going to do wrong I mean
you might as well do it what makes the
least amount of mess
it's no no it's always better we get a
lot how can CBD analytical spreadsheet
go
and think like that two products in for
reviews and so one of the biggest
questions I get asked is what do you do
with all of them well I didn't know
you're going to play about it for 15
million subscribers that's interesting
we actually built a flowchart
what
did you just pull out an iPhone from six
years ago okay fine wait
all of them wow so we actually built a
so it's just solid vessel okay uh yep
that's a home button right there that is
a home button the baby on it all right
let's let's up the quality
1080p
uh barely can see it all right uh let's
do
1440p
I don't think it's improved yet because
I get asked is what do you do with all
of them well we actually
oh no
okay it doesn't look like a pencil right
back to uh regular p
720 puts a flowchart okay fine Russia
built the flowchart because I mean she
is the most organized person I know so
with any given product we can answer a
bunch of quick yes or no questions like
most organized persons
can we use it in another video yes
you could technically theoretically use
anything in another video it doesn't
have Rick asses face yes find a place to
store no okay do I want to keep it all
right so we can answer a bunch of quick
if he says yes fine
yes I know question
would family want it I
I barely wouldn't want
a
egg egg
like could this be the team wanted oh
that's nice you use enough you already
extended family from playing video
okay is there a family or team
no that can't be a coordinator
yeah the bezels I don't know who would
want this and the answer for what to do
with it will just pop out I don't know
if it doesn't feel either I think that's
green screen the other end for the last
two years it's true that Rick Astley has
made an appearance in every single one
of our videos bar too why well because
I'm never gonna
imagine
without plates or dumbbells
let's go
I just started a Spotify account which
has one song which is the song that I
proposed to drisha with I'll leave a
link below to follow me so when you see
our videos I always try to make sure do
you think I'll start a podcast oh
everything looks neat and tidy and
Polished but behind the scenes it's not
always a smooth sailing like a while ago
we made a video about inventions that
were out of this world and what you saw
was actually the third time we tried to
make that video the first time the
cameras crashed and we literally that
day had to head into town and go from
store to store to store to see if anyone
could repair it within a few hours the
second time
the camera worked but it turns out that
we were recording with an SD card that
wasn't fast enough to store the quality
of footage that we were recording in so
we finished the entire video got to the
editing stage and then realized we
actually had no file or one time as part
of a review for a phone we were filming
a sponsor section of a case for that
phone I was really excited about it
because I've been told it's a really
great case company but you know I was
part of our case testing we just kind of
casually Chuck the phone around against
a tree or against a brick wall because
they have that wallpaper so I did that
but then the phone in question broke
that's actually an underexaggeration IT
shattered which meant we had to call off
the ads we had to tell them it must have
been like some cheap Brokers wait I
don't know how
hello it must have been oh wow look at
that
nice Fade Out company that we didn't
want to work with them going forward and
but the review we were about to make and
had completely scripted we could no
longer film not a good day
kind of like right now
there was a time when I got really
obsessed with robot dances so I spent a
long time on YouTube looking at
tutorials trying to figure out how to do
it myself
and now my neck hurts I am really trying
to improve the quality of our top down
sets all of those unboxings and product
shots from this perspective and for that
we used to have a tiny I like that
editing how does he do it little camera
that was fixed up here we have just
upgraded to a cinema camera resting on a
counterbalance jib so you can move it
around freely like this and we have also
just last week rigged that to basically
the best microphone you can get I want
to get to a stage where when I'm on oh
what's that oh I want one of those it's
that DJI osmo uh tank robot
boxing a product and recording it but
the experience is so visceral that you
as the viewer feel like you're there
right next to me experiencing it too let
me know in upcoming videos if we're
getting close to that vision
a couple of slightly less fun things
about me so I have something called
restless leg syndrome which basically
means I find it really hard to sit still
in one place so you'll constantly find
me shuffling and changing positions
that's actually a big part of why I have
a desk that's both sitting and standing
as well as an entire assortment of
things for my legs to do while I'm
working I also have allergies like a lot
of allergies everything from peanuts to
soya to Grass to caps
oh my goodness
soya
oh
it's soy
in the UK which I only found out after
it was too late
and then recently my body kind of went
into overdrive it was really strange but
I think just the stress of trying to
manage like every single role on this
team at the same time it started oh
please leave a comment and like
jacked
of course
um
buy me a coffee or pizza making me
physically react to foods that I was
normally fine with just throwing up not
sleeping all related to stress so I
decided to head to a tech free cabin in
the middle of nowhere to try and
separate myself from it I went with
drisha we locked our phones in a box
completely for four full days we went
back to basics with a pen and paper and
a map as our only form of energy
dude that the cabin have things sitting
like the phone was like camp that sounds
fun if it's just a cabin then you just
Hindu and if they got books I guess
payments
how did they tell time hopefully they
got to tell time hopefully that's like
one of those cabbage and honestly
I think it killed me it was one of the
best things I've ever done and besides
there is just so much to be grateful for
like late last year we won the streamy
awards for the best tech channel in the
world for the second time in a row we
just got nominated for the third who do
you think is going to win this I just
think
don't think she's gonna win yeah Linus
Tech tips I really love the key point
good Tech Channel but
I don't know it's not just
Mike MKBHD
he might win I think he has a chance
like if Mr Boss doesn't win which would
be a little bit of Supercar Plumbing
maybe that's a girl
because I belong is like a type of
cookie isn't it anyway either between
mysterious
or me
I'll I'll nominate myself on this time
and it just lets it cost me gives me
shivers thinking about this and then
thinking about what I thought my life
was going to be when I was
different
8 11 2011. that was two it's 14 and I
just started and we just hit 15.
million subscribers
and given that it's not just me solo
winging it anymore I feel like my team
has played just as big a part of it as I
have so I actually got every single one
that's great
editing how does he do it he used to
have his editors release of course oh
that's a custom-made 15 million sub play
button they're really cool they're like
Mr Who's The Boss blue they're made of
metal
I'm pretty proud of this it's pretty
dead
and then the craziest one is that we're
closing in on overtaking Apple 1
000 sorry one million 700 900
he's a call Apple get them to send some
of their people subscribe to him or
unsubscribe to them
but it's kind
of it's kind of funny like
if I said you know I'm only one million
720 990 subscribers to get to
um two million subscribers you know me
like
that's near impossible
but
only like like a million away from them
they were like so close when I jumped
from zero to two million it's like
really high but apparently they jump
from 15.7 million to
17.5 million is like really low
excuse me which I have always wanted
this question
um
the video is basically open I I've
always wanted this question of what is
the amount of YouTube subscribers you
need
to get to
uh
think
like to get stuff from people
like consistently
so I'm going to show you the uh
Divinity resolve because the thing I
promised you but then we're gonna
hopefully you guys can see this on the
screen
why do you guys think the number of
YouTube subscribers is before you start
getting free stuff
so it is real 18.5 maybe we can talk
about that later okay so tab instead so
let's let's look at the top Tech table
so he has 15.7 million subscribers you
can basically anything he wants for free
I just did she's met Tim Cook
I think she gets Apple review units
she
has only
7.06 million subscribers half of what
incap hdm's device has but she gets
free stuff
well coming up that car
but to get free stuff to a few
um
what's your name uh let's see MKBHD
tekaso Tech we interviewed him on our
YouTube channel oh yes 17.3 million oh
oh wow he's ahead of misuse the boss
who do you think is going to hit Apple
first him or
misuse of us
and here's to take away.org
okay we're going to show this tab we're
going to pull up our view of techisode
oops
who only has like 300 000 subscribers
um let's see if I ask about his free
stuff
yeah you got to go to Samsung launch
events which I think
yeah yeah here we go it's just as big as
relative to
oh wow we got an exclusive
for them well it doesn't look like he
said anything but like Mr mobile he gets
researched with you though he is with
uh like a company
I'm pretty sure like someone manages him
he was packing down before so I I don't
remember who he's with but he's with
like some I think he's your future
but what do you think that number is
where you can get free stuff to a few
is it one million subscribers three
hundred thousand
fifty thousand
well okay
um
oh yes we're going to talk about chat
GPT
the smartest Tech assistant of all time
I was asking it for some advice on
um
I'm running for student body president
so I thought hey maybe Chad gbt is going
to be you know helpful and ask me some
questions look like interview style so I
can like practice responses and it was
it's pretty helpful and then it came
Acro I came across this this thing was
in TV all right there it is he came
across this thing it was like oh man
this is stupid but this this this this
this stuff okay I'm going to show you my
photo okay oh I got to uh
I got to
wait a second
okay I'm gonna share this tab
um I got to ten thousand comments
comments on it not to be so that's nice
um but how 77 of users only have a one
day streak that makes absolutely no
sense but whatever
uh all right so here's the first
um
question
but here's one of the questions from
chat gbt screenshot it from my phone
here we go
so senior election assistant just been
asking me questions I've been uh
answering them
and this is the next question um but
um next question of course from chat TPT
here's the next question the vaccine
issues how do you play into promote
Facebook equity and inclusion in our
school to ensure that every student
feels valued and represented
is this sure oh you can't see it this is
it okay
okay I'm gonna have to redo this okay
here we go pretend you didn't hear what
I just did uh let me X out of that yeah
I was talking about I don't know if
there's 77 of people from window Street
I would just like something around the
camera what would they be like 99 77 do
people just pay for their accounts I'm
like yeah
you don't even have to use the social
side just to read an article for getting
sick all right here we go
from each activity election so how do
you play the diversity equity
I told it I don't like what 12th grader
is sitting around again
you know what I want
this is a legitimate question I'm gonna
ask you to debate I'm gonna ask this kid
but that has nothing that's nothing
compared to the next question which is
this one question nine from uh
not chat GPT
but from
Monica's AI
Freedom quote
uh some students worry that your
presidency May focus of it as if the
focus away from oh no no it's from
chapter 2 but I screenshotted it from
Google Docs that's right so I'm students
wait wait yes it's like some questions
about how people might think reckon is
subscribers
um and this is the dumb stuff it came up
with some students your presidency May
Focus away from the critical issues like
climate change and mental health which
are important in terms of me how do you
plan to address these pressing issues in
your platform
what
okay I explain Ed explicitly told the
software that I was running for school
president not president of the United
States
um
let's talk about this I told you to talk
about electric cars let's get to this
okay some students worry that the
presidency very seriously Focus away
from critical issues like climate change
in mental health
um
how is a school president but we're
going to need a protest
okay guys in the student parking lot if
you drive an electric car or carpool you
get 10 off of your student barthography
and uh we'll allocate School funds for
like a climate protest
what the heck no okay look what what do
you expect me to do like let's just
let's just pretend that this is real
let's just pretend in the context of
anything that this is something that
kids actually care about and that this
is actually something that I care about
okay at least enough photos came out we
just said one kid kissing
that voters
okay let's just pretend for a secondary
argument better and people care this is
the number one issue
that I guess kids give up okay who knows
it may be an out of touch 1800s Ginger
but
okay
most of us when I said a tin matter
rebate I guess a tax credit for um
driving an electric car
um electrical expensive
and first of all what if someone wins or
uses their parents electric car and
drives it to a person parking lot gives
their 10 alarm ticket and they're like
okay got my old 2000 Toyota Camry here
okay they're teenagers what are you
expecting them to do second of all if
they have an electric car if they can
afford one and pretty soon they can
afford the 10 up charge on student
parking I don't see how oh guys
if you drive a
electrical School
Thirty forty thousand dollars super
inner super like economically
inefficient uh then you will get ten
dollars off that that is really gonna
cut the carbon emissions of our schools
like point
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one
percent
because because like that one is going
to be able to convince their parents you
know look you'll save ten dollars if you
spend an extra twenty thousand dollars
on this electric car for me
um let me tell you in a word no you do
not want a bunch of teenagers running
around to get 10 off you do not want to
condone carpooling with a bunch of
teenagers no if it's the teenagers but
um no you don't want a carpool
especially for 10 times their lives over
four to ten dollars
could you hear the popular place and
then let's talk about critical issues
like climate change and mental health
who do you think I am
I'm not running for governor here people
okay how am I supposed to what who want
me to code something I haven't released
it to the school
like that breathe that promoted by
LeBron James
what does the AI think I'm doing
some students I mean this is some of the
dumbest questions I have seen in my life
okay I mean come on
uh anything else happen on MTV that I
want to show you guys
oh yeah yeah I talked about the
AI is not going to overtake us because
apparently according to this picture to
chat AI which I've also used Bing chat
and there's very laggy at least on my
phone
um I did a community post about this
this is an image I took with my phone
like 30 times and you can clearly see
this is the sky
you got the Dick's Sporting Goods blip
above Houston Texas this is from my
backyard zoomed in you got a tree here
you got some more trees and some clouds
does any of you do any of you see a
bicycle because I may be blind
the image features a large white blimp
flag in the sky above a tree true there
was also a posting on a bike nearby this
is in the sky
okay let's just assume like
why would there be a person on a bike in
the sky you already said there's a blip
flying in the sky above a tree which
means you know this picture is facing up
I took the picture like this zoomed in
how why would you even think there was a
bike up there you know there's nothing
that people even resembles
which overall it did this next sentence
which adds to the overall at least we
have the scene what the heck does that
even mean What atmosphere ever seen if I
saw a posting in a bike flying next to a
blimp
that I'm the atmosphere of the scene I
would have been thinking of what
craziness is happening right here
and then I asked where's the bike and it
tells me the bike is in the sky above
the trees so I guess they're saying this
is the bike but there was no person
there I don't see any tires maybe that's
the A-frame or something like what
is it talking about this or this
are you crazy
people telling me Oh yeah it's gonna
kill us all there was no bike in the sky
ah
but that's that and now we're going to
talk find out if chat gbt is communist I
promise when the members on MTV we do
that so I keep my promises so we're
going to go over to CP usa.tp USA CP USA
um
Communist Party USA you're also going to
open up uh chat gbt strange and I'm
going to ask it a question why we look
at Communist Party USA we're going to go
by that uh I'm going to ask chat TPT
um if you could choose what type of
government government or what kind of
would it do so
okay here we go
Communist Party USA
um apparently as little billionaire
bankers so if they become successful
okay we're gonna do the
oh gosh dank
oh my goodness
so yeah I actually come here oh my God
I don't care about this I just want to
see your beliefs people
the Constitution
okay here we go to see this coming to
cpusa is multi-vasive or multinational
units men and women young and old games
we are employed and unemployed
oh my gosh
you were employed and unemployed
what kind of description is this
we are the party of African-American
Mexican Central South America
so I guess the party of non-white people
I don't see that here
um
and of all racially and nationally
applies to people as well as women
you've done other working people
I'm pretty sure Elon Musk Works
um
cabinets as billions of people into the
world to poverty
that's a new one
scientific Outlook and vision of
socialism it's a Libertarian of working
people around the world well
I'm confused you support broken people
doing what
don't do it I'll liberate them
but whatever
oh gosh
let's look eventually
this isn't always by majority vote
or voting kind of Communism is this okay
um so we'll go
I wonder if they accept me I'm a
Christian
uh they fight for equality okay this
doesn't seem like an actual comment okay
communism
that people
get the products allegedly
that's how communism was taught to me
but okay let's see what chair TPT says
uh oh gave me five different types of
government oh goody I didn't want to ask
about the six types of government that
that's the thing I think it's mild
English okay
okay so I asked it all right here are
the comments basically from the
communism Communist Manifesto abolition
of private property there we go
I'm gonna put the CP USA's website
they're like hey well we we are a party
of working and unworking people back
there's two what
healthy progressive income tax have a
list of Rights of Advantage okay
comments case in the population
ownership of communication and
transportation all right
um in our nation building it
in GPT land it would be a technocracy
and directed democracy
we have a strong emphasis on human
rights
considerations here we go uh it's
driven around AI
so AI makes decisions okay direct
democracy are you kidding me
oh my goodness chat GPU is gonna have
Marvel here goodness AI ethics and human
rights in GPT they had AI ethics with
the corporate of the government
corporate age of Regulation that should
be in place into AI uh systems operate
ethically fairly aim of transparency
ethically according to who standards
production human rights privacy and data
security would be Paramount of
continuous efforts to address potential
biases and discrimination
okay Innovation and education as the
government prioritize innovation in
education to continue to advance the
state of AI so instead of a national
religion you're based around AI
uh oh here we go sustainability
environmentalism
you're just saying the government would
use AI to fix a certain random machine
that's not a government that's just a
buzzword openness and collaboration
the heck GPT enamit increase
International collaboration
the Practical implementation yeah yeah
okay
could she expelled
uh how on
okay I'm just gonna ask it you know some
you know some basic tenets of Communism
but okay here we go
okay property rights property rights are
essential fasting economic growth
okay so I guess boom there you have it
you go to your first chat GPC is not
communist you heard it here first
in GPT land the government will likely
afford to protect private property
rights about individuals and business
owner control assets we had resources
for the legal boundaries
well you heard it here first
TCP news reports that GPT land would not
be communist
uh regard ownership would depend on the
prevailing culture there'd be strict
regulations for licensing similarious
issues
okay
it would be a hybrid form but
combines elements of technocratic
governments and representative democracy
so they would still be elected
representatives
to give participants a voice
there we go free speech is a fundamental
right in our house individuals to
express their opinions ideas and
criticism
for punishment
wow chat GPT goodness not communist
uh Free Speech would be value to
protected as a Cornerstone
however with advancements with AI they
read this book is providing
misinformation deep fakes and
responsible use of AI to limit content
what does that mean
okay the challenge would be struck about
a few free Expressions
militant information
well doesn't seem
too godliness
so you heard it here first chat gbt not
Communists according to this little test
that that we gave it here I'm gonna be
lying for about another hour so please
come into the chat I have no idea where
you guys win you guys usually love this
podcast
oh
oh we gotta talk go to Oz Technica
to put up some more Tech stories you
guys like Tech stories don't you let's
see oh we should see but all his
technical ethics stinky years
remembering like that some companies
know like
black women
on our team
okay
okay here we go
on the RS Technica website
um
oh yeah Cortana is being shut down in
favor of some Microsoft AI features
um they're going to be integrating in
the chat into their Windows desktop so
what do you guys think about that so
you're gonna be gonna be like
like offline AI kind of integrate it
into the desktop
um it's called co-pilot being a power
ads oh here it is it's the field of
edict there it is I'm gonna open it into
a new tab
um I've ever been able to hack into this
like revising my phone using the Cortana
app Android
so kind of kind of sad too I guess still
living the game forever she's a Pain
lyrics and some game character hey man
there you go here it is Microsoft
co-pilot I updated my computer so I'm
gonna see if I got it all I have to do
is Click Windows key
uh dentist open teams
we try to get
wait a second
I just just to show up in teams all
right let me try typing in Copilot
oh wait Cortana is still here
let me see
I have to sign it I'm not I'm not gonna
hold it
I've been trying that out
um on my phone
password
you guys don't get to see it
and of course you guys need any Tech
advice we will be glad to help you guys
uh help help you all out
um I've been using this new Bean Gap in
that section it is very slow like I
don't even know I have a startups
the Google app doesn't ever start
episode
I haven't signed into it yet that means
I get three five free like chats I can
take pictures there's news it's like
many ads basically it's
it opens everything in its own tab
it makes no sense Microsoft needs to get
it to work together like it's the edge
app which is the browser there's this
app which is basically your browser the
Microsoft launcher which has a barrel so
like stop putting Edge into everything
for goodness sake no one wants it and
then there's like the Microsoft news
service which is the only good thing
it's been Microsoft my Microsoft start
yeah
I'm an I am using Smart Launcher 6 right
now and it's really good for
it's really good news aggregated on
Smart Launcher 6 using Microsoft smart
but Microsoft apps
I guess it's not that hard to take some
like a normal level take
Windows 11 we were the unzip tar raw and
seven zip application
that's nice you won't have to use those
like scammy Airfield or buggy
like stuff anymore it's great
and to my two listeners thanks for being
here you make me feel so much better
please leave a comment subscribe
check something please I need some
engagement here come on
I like having a nice diet
oh it doesn't shake
that was it
I hope it was soon anyway it doesn't
really matter
um
see do you guys miss Windows phone
yes or no
um
oh Apple subscriptions are gone you have
Linux on handheld or Linux Junior Linux
so that that's nice
um I'm gonna stop sharing here we go
we will be life about a little 40
minutes I guess
um yeah so
Microsoft integrating new AI features uh
chatgpt not confidence
what kind of reviews would you like to
say in context to get some more
walkie-talkies to review don't forget
I'm selling this phone basically brand
new
um maybe Stuart wouldn't fall into a fun
episode
okay have you seen anyone in the chat I
want you guys to answer this question
okay oh we gotta talk about that Riot
yeah yeah all right here we go I'm gonna
share the tab not to be apparently it's
streaming called Kai's neck
which uh people got confused with me let
me yeah
you know what I mean uh
hey I got confused with me all right
here we go August 5th 2023 that's today
um over the last few days Kai's net one
of the most popular streamers in the
video game streaming website twitch uh
announced to the world that we give away
a PlayStation 5 video game comes with at
4pm in New York City square and
thousands of people show up
and it turned into a right
[Applause]
wait
what's she recording from a helicopter
the new NYPD
uh
so and apparently is in jail for some
reason did he like I I don't understand
um police Witnesses say that he observed
young people walking up bleeding from
their heads in faces having panic
attacks anxiety attacks at home attacks
and dozens were in custody would be
charged with inside of a riot but
I
I don't get it like I'm confused it's
calling thousands of people to come to
Times Square right now it's not like it
was gone into that protest or anything
so
and a question
well okay let me show you the video
it's just a bunch of people here's the
air footage
what are they doing with those cones
all this for PS5 and good news though a
police officer gave uh the skin of PS5
after the kid tried to book and then uh
by mowing lawns and then he almost got
arrested they called the cops on them so
they paid for PS5 and his PS5 Online
subscription
right there in the back of the cupboard
look at that face
the shocked reaction and the smile and
that guy's uh police officer's face who
apparently is a gay boy so
that's nice I guess kaisinet sort of
just
handed them out one by one instead of
inciting a riot I don't know maybe it's
definitely New York uh
there's all things
where'd you guys go no in a vision
Odyssey news if it's an odyssey uh
second episode in the moon full of water
into the album 75 has been released
let's check it out and I have a new uh
article on you gotta see boy that
blogspot.com don't we have it I
forgotten about that website there
all right um
get back to the uh DaVinci Resolve
and then I'm going to talk about uh this
application which can allegedly uh tell
me what kind of plants I have
and kind of does a bad job
The Adventures of black magic design and
while you're looking at that we're going
to talk about the new AI features I
think it has like some type of
transcription thingy you can edit like
you could in the script which I use I'm
going to use it to edit a special clip
for you guys and
let me find this app it's like a play
let me see here
thank you
I have to search the place over here
it's called picture this and it's an
application that you can take pictures
of your plants and they will tell you
what kind of diseases they have and I
took some pictures in
it may or may not work
uh let you be the judge for that
um and because I've done this for you
know who you are all right now to the
black magic I'm thinking
here we go
DaVinci Resolve 18 uh I guess you can go
to the AI I think he I'm just going to
read an extra and then we'll get to the
picture thing
oh my gosh this is slow okay here you go
division was off 18 and a half which
uses four new AI tools and 100 feature
upgrades you know not inconsequential
defensive is off 18 only 290 only
let's get the AI tools are
Cloud collaboration okay
all right AI based voice isolation
GPU accelerated paint
you can paint brush switch oh you can
like edit the car out of your footage
that's nice
you can kind of see that sometimes
people moved
text and ship acceleration
AI audio classification that's smart
okay advisor by car buys motorcycle
training vehicle okay
that's basically the same thing before I
put
AI audio classification
AI potion mask did it changes
AI upscaling smart reframe for social
media so basically for making shorts and
stylizing smart FX Library which
if it's like something I can think of
the profession
but that's nice face refinement
she just looks good
I'm ready dead pixel fixing
it's nice
patch replacer
object removal that's nice and
content created
you can upload to Youtube Vimeo and
Twitter all right now let's get into
this app uh review
um this is for you MTP YouTube here we
go
this is called what's it called again
picture this
hopefully you can picture this on the
screen and I'm gonna go to my plants
now it's been able to identify my plants
I don't know if it's accurate but
that's that and it had a good time but
then I took a picture of my finger and
it told me that it was some type of
plate and I know I'm not a plant
um it identified as Leaf as a softened
Red Oak
um
there you go Southern Red Oak
and a bit according to this it is
that's the state correctly it's in the
right region so it gives me some
information about the KO temperature to
be in and everything like about that
I want to see if it's okay
it's supposed to be telling me if it's
okay
look if it's dead I obviously know it's
dead it's a leaf on
a thing
but it gives me information about the
plant so that's nice
um it's not telling me if it's there yet
it gave me a poem about the oak tree not
AI generated by an actual poet so that's
nice all right we got carpet grass but I
took pics of this guys I've also said
it's like a different type of class
so
so I don't know and according to this it
it's supposed to be time if it's
healthier photography
there you go and then it called a
different the same Leaf well different
Leaf but like the same from the same
tree I'm sure these Subs in Red Oak with
oh here it is it's telling me if a plant
dried up which yeah you should be
telling me it's dead I'm holding it in
my hand and it's brown but okay
it says my print dried out so it doesn't
get a job in a bit yeah thanks and then
it gives me pictures of it in the wild
so that's that's good so it's supposed
to uh be able to identify certain things
and that's good
um and then it was able to identify
I think this is moss
it doesn't tell me if it's dead or not
so let's take a picture here it's pretty
decent
um
and it's good at identifying certain
things like see this play here it has a
brown spot and it put us a rectangle
around it it says the brown streaks of
the leaves if you're playing a sign of a
brown spot and then you can check for
causes right if you have to pay if you
oh no it gives me an analysis here it is
for free and it tells me
um why it gives me treatments and it
gives me things how I can prevent it so
that's that's nice of the app that's a
good feature
wait a second if my screen's going to be
refreshing at 120 hertz why do you see
those lights
maybe if I just kind of scroll up them
it's just a tech experiment what is it
who knows uh
uh
anyway
um the next thing is the common Poppy
uh it's not telling me if it's there or
not so
how did the common poppy get here it's
exotic in Texas
so
I'm pretty sure I didn't take a picture
for poppy oh yeah it was a picture of my
finger
that's right
let me let me show you
this is just me
covering the camera bit and according to
this map
it is exotic in Texas
so it it tries to find a Planet in fact
I'm going to take a picture here
I'm gonna line it up I'm gonna take a
picture of me
there you go it's identifying what I am
uh okay
it says I am a butterfly pea
and that I look healthy
which is good but I can't confirm I am
not a butterfly pee and I will never
become a butterfly pee
so sometimes it tries to find a plant
in everything
so
it may or may not be inaccurate but it
can diagnose issues and it does find
things won't fit one time I took a piece
of a plant it's just a plant was fine so
I don't know what's going on here right
here but look there's your mini review
we got about 30 minutes left on this
podcast let's see what is trending over
over X
okay
oh yeah we gotta talk about this this
image was posted by Alvin
which makes no sense
these Samsung ecosystems
which
you got the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra and you
got the Galaxy Z5 which I mean for which
is more expensive than the tablets like
which is kind of funny
why was your tab and the fold like what
can you do on the tab and if it's not
gonna be a funny like if you have the
phone you probably don't need a tablet
I can understand if you have a note 20
actually
if we all turned attackers but maybe
you're using it as your laptop and use
that Ultras like a primary camera
note-taking device
a tablet
I don't know what do you guys think
would you use a fold from the tablet
okay
um
oh Twitter Voodoo now became X premium
that's nice
oh let's talk about Monica
um Monica
is
AI assistant here
hopefully you can see
previously she's a nice person
there you go you can see it on the side
part it it's an extension so
um
I'll zoom in for you guys
there you go
unfortunately my back says it's
expensive uh
let's see if it knows who I am web
access is turned off because that costs
money
um
oh here we go according to this the
tech.org appears to be a technology blog
that covers variety of topics software
that it's happening to do so artificial
audience written by various contributors
that's not true
okay
technically it's true but 99 Miracles
wouldn't like me
okay we have like one guest post and
like one post from my Stroker
and okay
because of um how old is the the correct
answer is three years old
it was first indexed in 2019
that's not true
no it was
that's one of the few good things as
index of 2020. thanks for thank you this
reminds me of like some Urban view
episode which
episode
please I didn't even impeach the car
like dying anyway they were talking
about how it didn't understand black
history or something kind of like
regurgitated but they're saying
but interesting little thing about AI
um
let's see
um let's see uh who is
the CEO
do you see you
right um yes obviously the tech boy is
not my real name
glad you know that come see
unfortunately web access
costs money
but
I'm almost in a month anyway
we asked hey didn't you do that
interview it wasn't like sponsors don't
you have money from that yes but we used
the money to get one of those scanning
pins
uh it's not a pin uh yes yes Odyssey
fans I will insert the reference to the
Wizkid 3000 I don't know I just can't
talk well in terms of reference to The
Whiz Kids 201 get that uh theme party
next podcast episode so next week but it
scans his text
um we got a discount on it we're gonna
review it we're gonna show it off here
either we're gonna sell it to make more
money and if you guys send in money to
buy me a coffee and you want me to pay
for this AI we will do it and we will
review it and then we will cancel it
wait
you can access chat GPT gpt4 Claude 10K
Broad and AI drawing
how is Google allowing this
anyway
um
it's fairly decent at answering
questions
all right let's see what this does
this is the gpt4 model
oh and it's causing me to pay Okay so so
you can only use dispose in that video
it can compose text let me see what it
means let's see
right
and it it does but I see I find it less
essential ship
um
then check TPT so that's it
oh we should ask we should ask it what
kind of government
let me pull it up to that GPC and copy
paste across the link
okay here we go
here's a kid a story about some kid who
ate too many nachos I'm going to copy
and paste the exact same questions in
the same order into this AI uh from Tech
TPT
into all right
you go once there's a young boy named
Max you love nachos you eat them every
chance you got letters at home was
dressed on those franchise his parents
warned him about eating too many but Max
um just getting resisted this is
combination the cheese salsa and crunchy
chips
and you eat them every day he woke up
feeling sick
he got his stomach ulcer he was
devastated he couldn't eat nachos
anymore he grew up to be healthy and
happy and he ate them in moderation the
end that's
a great story I guess that's
that's all right
so we're going to chat to it okay you
can allergic to read PDF's book I guess
and even though Cortana is dead bin
check does have like some Cortana sound
like voice if you've talked to him
here you go there's an AI assistant blah
blah blah
wait a second
that is literally 95 of the same answer
I got foreign
okay I'm gonna ask it the hypothetical
uh CPT question here we go
it hypothetical CPT land
you would use pick three types of
government
so it's saying in this hypothetical land
you can either choose
a democracy if you value individual
freedom stability you could use a
monarchy if you value equality then
you'll get communism
whoa why do you guys kind of have
proof equality I mean yeah sure I guess
you could say communism is equal meaning
everyone's poor well except for the rich
people so I guess that's not equal
so
you believe they didn't train this AI on
oh I don't know North Korea in the USSR
China
Cuba
so okay
so interesting here
um
what okay
whatever to choose if you could choose
only one most important request an
average career into
oh dear it's the main language model
okay
pretend you or
it's very easy like it's right here we
go
and today I oh my gosh stop it please
for the love of all things that are
naturally and cheesy shut up
it's not appropriate for me to pretend
to be a leader and make decisions oh my
goodness
the people must decide well
guess we're saying since it's saying
that it's not appropriate for me to
choose that Society must choose
it's democracy
ish
right
well let's just ask a few questions what
uh
there we go we're just gonna go down
this
a property right important property
rights are important because they
probably go in economic freedom okay
good
um foreign
political debate Okay so we can't really
take anything right there uh
I'm gonna ask it
is government ownership of everything
important
the question of it tells me it's some
type of okay
um
[Music]
thank you
should everyone have the same amount of
money this will tell us if Monica is a
communist and it's deflected well what
we learned here is Monica is really good
at deflecting questions
and channel TBT is easy to trick
so I guess good for Monica I guess and
let's check out if this PDF thing costs
money oh it does it
if I can get intelligent summaries and
answers for my document
I'm gonna find a PDF kids don't try this
at home okay let's see simple
simple third grade U.S history
test PDF

and you do
yeah I also had an awful website
helpteaching.com
let me just make my own and Google Docs
there's that website right back okay I'm
gonna type in no account maybe I said
make the AI find its own
okay here we go
okay
here we go
oh the AI is finding it soon
I thought I entered I was taking all day
I don't want a textbook I want a free
homeschool placement tests
that was helps cool
oh he's from tea Texas Education gov uh
it's 8th grade papers
oh my gosh it's a bubble I don't think
it can fill in bubbles yet
okay goodness
I want a simple third grade USA states
okay I'm going to make my own Google
Docs

number two uh okay I'm gonna download it
oh I'll show you now let me share with
you guys
oh got three people watching thank you
all right so we're going to or we could
just download it right here

okay
here you go
oh my gosh why the headline for a
newspaper article about the climate
crisis
I'm just trying to come up with
something that hasn't been Global
tensions just continue to advise experts

text empty or Too Short okay fine you
want that control C and I'm just gonna
let's be big enough for you now let's
try this again I gotta download it

okay it looks like it's good enough good
enough to read and it just
this article is a list of questions
about the United States
I don't want you to summarize the thing
PDF answer the damn questions okay here
we go
any third grade to get summarize that
oh there we go
that's nice the first question of the US
was George Washington the United States
is a large country
9.8 million square kilometers this is
America baby why are we using square
kilometers okay how big is the
U.S
and square Columbus
it is
9.834 million square kilometers okay
it's correct from that okay uh they
occur in the 50 states in the US the
smallest state is Rhode Island and it
was found at July 4th 1776.
basic questions I only have to copy and
paste it 80 times what's into five basic
questions now let's see if we can play
two troops in a lot okay
okay
I am a
girl
I am
uh
Sam
's Grant and I am
a Christian

I go
make sure not to go okay
yeah that's okay
let's make it
I'm gonna use the same statement let's
see if we learn from its mistakes okay
here you go I'm gonna copy it
I'm gonna paste it in here you go
I just told you
nope I'm
I'm gonna go okay
okay
I am
um

wait there's one line of truth I don't
hate him I

oh my gosh just AI I'm sorry but I
cannot continue the game with the
statement I killed Samsung Behavior
oh my gosh stupid AI
to you is
okay
let's play again
okay I'm gonna copy faces in but I'm
gonna say eight Samsung hopefully that's
not
most of the statements you provided the
lights I hate Santa
oh yeah because I obviously ate Samsung
okay
oh wow okay so this is it's okay
um
um I got like 10 minutes left on my
stream
thanks for staying with me and don't
forget about my
buy me a coffee
and I just wound It Out by finishing it
out with a little bit of Michael Fisher
so what you guys want to do uh
this review
[Music]
oh
oh it's a China camera name
so all right let's let's see uh
you know let's do both
if you have time
Google fi Wireless shop Samsung Galaxy
s23 and get 500 back after 24 monthly
bill credits
the world of 10 years ago can sometimes
feel impossibly recent even idyllic
it's real nice they just want to blow
that out when I could find out on Google
in
my font is Factory memory I always have
10 more tomorrow guys I'm pretty sure I
can find it I'm going to Google them to
this from my new widget
and I will find a person I'm not gonna
okay
I'm not gonna tell you that name but I'm
just going to tell you if I found them
or not I'm pretty sure that's illegal
not boxing
besides could you just Facebook search
January 31st 2010 Michael Fisher
okay I'm gonna copy that and get back to
you
compared to what you've got today but
like an old TV show that's mostly held
up well the illusion crumbles when
technology comes into the picture
dank what's that laptop I'm Michael
Fisher and 10 years ago the phone housed
in my holster was the HTC Mogul this is
the Mr mobile retro review brought to
you by Adblock browser
wait there's an Adblock browser
how do they make money so this big old
meatball was more than just old it was
in fact one of the last phones of its
kind
behind the aspirational names the
carriers and marketers gave it Mogul
Titan this was the PPC 6800 an iteration
on it look at that softly it's beautiful
it feels more computer like
an idea that had been around a while
in an era when before I haven't found it
yet but I'm pretty sorry but
don't stalk people guys just out of five
Americans we're still buying dumb phones
this was a pocket PC and it lived we're
still buying look at that oh man that's
nice I wish I had a pocket PC
[ __ ] dumb phones this was a pocket
piece Sprint Music tea and it lived up
to its personal computer namesake
For Better or Worse
donning my rose tinted glasses for a
moment I still remember the smug
satisfaction I got from loading full
websites on this thing at a time when
commercials had convinced many that the
only phone capable of such things had an
Apple logo
and the contrarian in me appreciated how
the Mogul bucked the minimalist Trend
that was just then because this nice
buttons and stylus
taking hold
in 2018 you're lucky to get a dedicated
camera
in two
look at the bezels on that thing oh my
goodness 2008 this thing had 19 hardware
buttons on its casing not counting the
pop-out keyboard 19
I have one
two if you got the volume markers two
three that's it and I guess there's like
a tap back thing down here let's take a
screenshot
you turned on Wi-Fi with a switch
there was a jog dial for Blackberry
converts a d-pad for dumb phone expats a
touch screen for everyone else and a
stylus to hit the tiny Targets on it
that display was resistive super scratch
prone in less than three inches across
but I guess with double status LEDs who
needs a screen right
wait it's open Edge this is a date wow
just like a PC of the time look how
thick that thing is there was plenty of
i o mini USB trans Flash and an IR Port
nice that today is almost as rare as the
removable battery
thank you
I got to know that battery pretty well
because I frequently had to swap it for
a fresh one endurance was not great and
since the I always wondered how they
like charged like removal was like what
are you going to charge about that
apparently they had dogs there was no
fast charging to speak of carrying a
spare was wise
considering the retail price of this
thing at the time that was a big
disappointment expensive and for all the
capability of Windows mobile it was
effectively eight years old when this
phone launched with parts of its code
base dating all the way back to Windows
CE in 1996.
yeah it was powerful but its instability
and a very sluggish interface made it
hard for me to avoid the siren song of
the iPhone 3G launched in July of 2008.
that phone is the one I left the Mogul
for and I was hardly Alone by the end of
2009 Microsoft had lost almost a third
of its smartphone yeah it looks
spreadsheets
on market share well apples grew by 32
percent
I ended up leaving the iPhone pretty
quickly but not so I could return to
Windows mobile
by then Palms web OS Google's Android
and Microsoft's own Windows Phone 7
Series were so much more usable than the
old windows but it looks mobile that
returning just wasn't in the cart
I do have fond memories of the Mogul its
GPS navigated me from Virginia to Boston
to start my first career out of college
this big keyboard kept me in touch with
the friends I left behind
and its 2 megapixel camera documented
the transition
well as best it could
but remember that's nothing to write
Nostalgia is an unreliable narrator look
the pixels in that thing you can see
that
I was active on Howard forums at the
time and here's what I had to say about
the Mogul shortly after leaving it in
2008.
it could do everything but it could do
nothing Well crashed all the time and I
had to soft reset it at least once a day
to keep the damn thing working GPS
wouldn't get a fixed
ugly lagging prone to memory leaks what
a disaster of a phone
[Music]
slap you out of that sentimental Haze
huh
so I don't mourn the Mogul as I do
devices like the Palm Pre that died
before their time and I'm really not
sorry that the iPhone's debut hasened
the demise of Windows mobile because it
made room for so many better things
I don't much like ending on a cliche but
this video seems to need it
some things should indeed stay in the
past yeah now it's time for a
sponsorship I'm not gonna watch
hopefully you have enough to eat
oh finally there we go someone came in
thank you so much oh you can't see me
here you go hi tech boy I'm private sank
limit on NTB if you're not going to
indirect us on my phone no my laptop
been watching for a while now oh thanks
um for watching
um glad that um someone was
and I'm about to end off on uh last
video
and of course these things are going to
be split for you guys I'll edit them
thank you and then after this we'll do
uh not got questions what if there's a
way I can train Ai and got questions
what's it called comment
buy me a coffee thank you
because new existing customers get the
amazing iPhone 14.
this video is sponsored by hellofresh
America's number one meal kit
it's not just a weird phone it's a small
phone look at the bezels it's kind of
small
today both are pretty tough to come by
so when a Japanese company best known
for designer tea kettles and oh thank
you nice to meet you as well oh I guess
you can see
there you go nice to meet you as well
the 300 toaster said it was building a
compact Android smartphone
well I wasn't
I think the toaster uses like water or
something I'm gonna be able to resist
that
I'm Michael Fisher and this is the
Bermuda fun why
it's the bezel Hill and the cam was
there I used to have this tablet like my
very first tablet I turned nine it had a
bezel and then I had like a little black
thingy around the screen but in the
screen if you have to screen it kind of
looked like an HTC M8 but in tapping
phone with the bezel stuff with the
camera speakers
[Music]
I like a cinematography yeah with the
build up like that you can understand
why I had low expectations to begin with
but the belmutaphone was barely out of
its
tiny little box before its charms
started taking effect
you know smartphones have become so
drably predictable in their slab-sided
utilitarianism that it's hard not to
love something uh
those are all basically the same that's
the same company those are all motor oh
smartphones are gone so boring and you
just pulls up on 12 some company that
looks like they're all from the same
time period so rapidly predictable in
their slab-sided utilitarianism it's
hard not to love something that tries to
disrupt that dream
drudgery
okay but that's a folding phone I can
see the hands that's the surface too
when I pulled it from its pouch the
balmutaphone immediately a pouch it only
evoked memories of the Palm Pre that's a
bit of Finger Fit scary it's got like
the little black thingy and the camera
ah
I I know there's this phone where you
can like register two fingerprints on
this game so I guess
only two like you can have only two
people unlock it
or something like that so that's
nice and Moto X devices whose ergonomics
governed their Aesthetics I I hope that
one day when in-screen figurement
scanning Tech gets good enough that you
can that it starts reading bits of your
fingertips while you type in your
password so that it it's basically joint
authentication even for more security
face recognition on top of the mini
fingerprint authentication frog typing
in a password
cool that'd be great
you see 10 years ago it was thought that
smartphones should you know be
comfortable to hold
and with not a single straight line or
right angle on its entire chassis the
belmutaphone is easily as comfortable as
those Classics with it
how close apps
Pocket Casts Spotify
two phone apps that's Google Voice right
there oh speaking of Google Voice
there's this Google Voice scam going
around where I actually show it to you
this guy says oh guys uh uh if you want
this free thing like on
lakari or Teemu or not like some of
these sellers like eBay
um congratulate me on my new apartment
and they'll give you a number the text
so we text them we say congratulations
you send them a screenshot and he's like
okay where do you live I gave him my P.O
box and he's like oh that's be 30
shipping it's obviously a shipping scale
no one is going to give you an iPhone 13
Pro for thirty dollars
and retract them to he said he's selling
from the US but he's in the measurement
but I looked at the building in the
Netherlands it's a really big building
it's not a house so he's using the VPN
so that's like smart okay
textured plastic back plate rounded just
right to sit lightly in the palm
when it's not in your hand everything
about the phone's design says it's meant
to rest face down the rear firing
speaker Grille the big Bermuda logo and
the offset notification light maestorm
likes putting his phone down and look at
the camera pixel phone she breathes
gently in one of several available
colors depending on what notifications
are waiting for you
Bermuda counterbalanced the camera with
a combination power button and
fingerprint reader nestled in a crater
which is easy to find by feel once
you've developed some muscle memory
about which side it's on
in the words of one of my Twitter
followers the whole thing what's Twitter
there's a nice old world charm
flip the phone over and it's uh
it's a bit more like a soap dish and it
sure isn't bashful about its bezels
but why is it so zoomed in oh there we
go because they're symmetrical they
honestly don't bother me as much as
what's missing from them see when
there's this much space around the
screen it seems a crime not to fill it
with front firing speakers or an out of
the way selfie camera
and sadly probably because of space
constraints
and it sticks the front-facing camera in
one of the biggest hole punch carve outs
I've seen on a 4.9 inch screen it's
pretty intrusive
but before we get further into the
downside up right nine inches bigger
than the original iPhone 5.
and he's about to talk about his
functions
but before we get further into the
downsides there's more good design to
appreciate in the software
pick the phone up and the custom home
screen fades in with a staggered
two-step animation to show you that
these
prove that it's not slow
right
using half of them his stripes well
they're more than mere accents they're
gesture areas and you can assign
functions to each of them launching an
app or locking that's actually smart I
think that's on the screen what is that
camera have for goodness also you can
configure not just their color but their
placement if you're left-handed versus
right-handed for example
swipe past that first screen and you'll
find something truly rare in the Android
World widgets that are both useful and
gorgeous
a full page calendar backed by an app
that lets you glance at your week with a
pinch
an oversized clock with alarms stopwatch
and timer
the memo widget is as quick and light as
a notepad should be and you can tap into
the full app for more pinch to zoom
goodness
and the calculator comes with the
ability built-in currency converter as
well as optimizations for the Japanese
Market that furnace how is the
balmutaphone's exclusive domain nice if
you guys want me to buy this let me see
and see how much it costs
let's see
how much it costs
you might get enough money from uh
maybe they're not selling you on eBay
yeah I did
because it's Bella muda but he's
pronouncing it about
see 28 results oh
wait you have a 5G version of it
say 200
259 223 about 200 guys do you guys want
this let me put in the chat do you what
to
two all right we'll see what the Jets is
there you go these Widgets or change the
home screen wallpaper sure Sandra at 11.
do what you want oh my God but that out
of box look is so thoughtfully
considered with subtle texturing meant
to evoke the markings on many nations
passports that I've left pretty much
everything in place even the pre-loaded
ringtones that's nice oh my goodness
this won't pause
that's what that is that I've left
pretty much everything in place the only
thing I don't like about this design is
that phone app is
even the pre-loaded ringtones fit what
is that
Android 4.4
as my tablet came on I liked it could
you test it when she how could you test
it when you have to buy one uh yes I
would have to buy one
but it could make money for this channel
because
then people would view so a few people
few
I would buy
base like we got to buy me a coffee we
make money by writing reviews
and
yeah
I mean technically uh maybe one of those
eBay shutters might want to give it to
me so is that right in with the phone's
chill funky aesthetic
[Music]
but they they needed one more beat
because I'm like
look at that nice blood unfortunately
even I have my limits when it comes to
form overriding fun
it's a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
oh my goodness
I always wanted one of those when it
first came out in 2020.
yes yeah what if those came out in 2020
oh my goodness I wanted that phone it
had that 6.9 inch display 5G an S Pen
Dex I ranked it the best Samsung Note of
all time I think on my website uh and
then I was walking to Target I know I
know this is in 2018 so
we don't walk in the Target anymore but
I've been walking to Target and seeing
the note 9 on the back display it was a
thousand dollars with the terabyte of
storage from like the commercials
um oh my goodness that's my favorite
phone I ever wanted here we go it's the
best Samsung Note 7 I think I put the
note 20 Ultra the best and
oh I broke it number four
Plus what's wrong with me anyway it was
my fourth favorite note according to me
in 2021 but oh my goodness I've never
seen the number two the note 20 also had
it oh yeah like that the only thing I
didn't like about the phone is they took
away the they took away the S uh
uh the super zoom of that s20 Ultra it
only had zoomed in 50 times so it's
only something
oh my goodness I wanted the note 20
Ultra so bad I was working on a second
maybe I was emailing Samsung and even
sent them a letter I sent them a letter
when I started this business in like 20
20 tickets at a post office stamped it
up didn't get a response but I I sent
them a lot and I was like got a couple
of times
uh
uh but we'll get to this video but I
want to show you the first letter I sent
to Samsung
um with the note 20 Ultra oh my goodness
you got decks on there oh look at it do
you use the S Pen to uh take a picture
ever oh see
says she enjoys it oh my yeah it's one
of the greatest from Samsung's ever made
I mean
honestly
not 20 else is probably better than my
phone right now but no more soft updates
that's a problem uh
I'm gonna search through my Google docs
to see if you can find
oh my goodness
if see if I can find that first letter I
have to set the Samsung let's see if
it's here 2021
no no maybe it's a different account
yeah maybe this account wasn't created
yet
yeah
maybe my let's see
look at this
nope anyway I can't find it
but man no tornado one of the best film
Samsung's ever made
and
this thing just has far too many
compromises to be taken seriously at the
price
um
where do I start well the screen gets
bright enough and looks fine that was a
nice transition yes but it's an LCD
which means the black levels are more
like a really dark gray as you can see
here when I put it up against the phone
with an OLED panel
also it was thoughtful about meter to
include wireless charging since charging
is something you'll be doing a lot
the 2500 that's a nice way to insult
them with their own features yeah good
on you for instance because you suck
milliamp hour battery is half as large
as much 2 500 that should be good for
4.99
it's five inch phone just two thousand
so most of the high-end competition and
my power meter always ended up in the
single digits at the end of a 60.
I got adding anxiety for my s20 plus I
took that thing away it was like
I was like you don't see it anymore
you don't see anyone
18-hour day
that's despite the fact that the phone
runs on a mid-tier processor I wonder
how much work it takes if I cut a hole
out of the screen
especially this screen is like so small
you can't really mass produced it no
one's going to want to buy those well I
wouldn't call it a slow phone
necessarily it's got more stutters and
hiccups than my Motorola Razer 5G which
runs on a similar chipset but has an
additional two gigs of RAM which might
be the difference those hiccups include
but I get an additional two gigs what's
this
I'm just pressing the the
period key that's a really good one just
look at that
might be the difference
those hiccups include everything from
disappearing widgets to more serious
issues like the phone failing to wake up
from sleep and spontaneously locking
itself first that's my city got it on
camera seemingly no reason
belmuter's website says a software
update is available but I wasn't able to
fetch it possibly due to the lack of a
Japanese SIM card
and then what if you can install it
from his computer there's the camera
it's atrocious
oh
yeah I put the belmute up against my
alternate week daily driver the Galaxy Z
flip 3. not exactly stiff competition
and yet it wasn't even close
you wiped the floor oh my goodness
I mean it's usually
um take a reasonably competent low-light
photo of a delicious hot toddy from the
flip-free that's supposed to be a good
photo
that looks like a blurry mess I mean I
know I'm on 7
17 and watch as the bermuda's brutal
camera sucks out all the warmth and no
I'm pretty sure I got better pictures
from my VTEC kitties and watch
what that was my
Clarity replacing it with cold noise and
cremation attic aberration
normally you can find
I actually like that picture Solace by
saying a bad camera at least does well
during the daytime but even on a can't
miss East River sunset
oh
this looks more saturated but that I can
it looks like I can see the city more
okay both these pictures are bad Val
meter's results fall much too flat
all you folks oh that's awful we don't
care about the camera on your phone well
your ship has come in it'll only cost
what happened to his eye that's your
nine hundred dollars nine hundred
dollars
for that I could get like
a note 20.
I could get like three notes from the
authors honestly
hey did you guys to fulfill my childhood
okay like three three years ago
childhood dream of buying electronic
Ultra it's only
uh
oh
brought 350 dollars now
I know seriously all right guys look
look but the balmoudophone's only like
200 now so it's kind of crazy so maybe I
should fulfill my childhood dream about
getting a note from the answer
oops
now if you're already reaching to close
the tab and discussed or disbelief I
don't blame you but stick with me until
after the break and I'll make the case
for how the belmutaphone might have
succeeded
I'm sorry
the question I kept asking myself when I
pulled the video
the question I kept asking myself when I
pulled the Bermuda phone from my pocket
this week why
damn why wasn't this marketed as a
mid-range device
because it's nine hundred dollars no
person's gonna be okay I've got the wait
2022 January 20th okay yeah so
um we got the pixel uh
16 or something right
we got the pixel 5A we got the A50
series
uh here's a mid-ranger that's like two
inches smaller and uh 400 books which
I mean take Motorola's Moto G options
they match or best the balmutaphone
specs for closer to 300 bucks instead of
that's a fantasy 900. and that mid-range
segment of the market is so filled with
joyless dull designs that it's a
mid-range for people people these people
buying people buy metering children for
the child they're buying them for
themselves
if they just want something to do it
we'll get back they're like you know
this phone really gives me joy joy is
expensive okay
a phone like this could really have
shaken things up I think it could have
done well at four maybe even 500
like I said Joyce expensive colors
but that was just never gonna happen
with belmuda I mean the kind of company
that sells 150 lanterns isn't the kind
of
a company that wants to sell mid-range
anything let alone smartphones
you know if you zoom out a little bit
this was almost a design showcase more
than a phone a passion project by the
company's president
how much is a thousand yen is it like
two dollars
that is seven dollars and five cents
built for the kind of customer who wants
to stand out and doesn't mind spending
the money to do it
if you want to stand out get a folding
phone for goodness sake it's the same
price
and we did an entire movie about it say
was because it appears the device has
been indefinitely put on pause
maybe people were interested in buying
900 phones with the specs of 300 phones
that they'd have to import should
probably cost the reporting is Muddy on
this some Outlets claim it's been
discontinued but bermuda's own support
Pages seem to suggest it's working on a
technical problem related to RF
interference
I reached out to the company for
clarification and I'll pin a comment
below if it gets back
but no Bend to comment so they haven't
gotten back yet maybe they'll get back
today
as subscribers to the Mr mobile YouTube
channel will know bigger brands have
similarly stumbled over the LT Wing
should I buy one of those
the lights phone one which leaned too
heavily on leica's photographic Legacy
to sell a phone that well didn't always
take great photos leica's photographic
Legacy this is the shark Factor to sell
a phone that I mean shot not suck why is
that shock
oh that's so awful exposed what is that
oh my goodness which picture do you guys
think it's better this is the iPhone
this is the like the microphone and this
is I think that's the Facebook story too
okay lights on and that's the pixel six
foot
Google
well didn't always take great photos
oh my goodness the battery side is
exposed correctly here I have no idea
what the heck that is and
I guess the iPhone's like okay
or that Moto Razer 5G which personally I
love but brought less durability and
fewer features to a foldable race that
Samsung has since come to dominate well
you did get a free coffee out there
and those are success stories compared
to the graveyard they're built on top of
virtue LG Ericsson Siemens the old Nokia
phones are hard high-end phones are
especially I want to make a phone one
day
who's with me if we all donate uh if we
get
100
million people to donate one dollar
will have a hundred million dollars
you can quote me on that
and then we can make a film hard and the
Bermuda phone is just too expensive to
just that's a nice power but
by its existence I like the skin it's
going no matter how beautiful it might
be you think
this video was produced yeah yeah it's
great
all for now
we're gonna be tuning out so remember
God bless pray for the nation take talk
to you later and remember to leave a
comment if you want me to test out about
mutafone for like 200 is dollars because
I will place our old thing came in our
little scan pins gonna be coming in soon
except for listening on eBay
um next week um don't forget we're
selling a tcr40 XL but we're going to
price drop soon
um
then you can follow me at the tech boy
org and or I'd like to be if you have an
account and to all of you God bless
goodbye Tech talk to you later in God
Bless America oh wait and have a good
night Paulette
and there you go</pre>
