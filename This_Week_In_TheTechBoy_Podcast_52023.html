in our own comment section look we have
a you may like section we have tags it's
just like not to be speaking of not the
being
the B are not the B that is the question
and the b or not to be that is the
question I just came up with that here
we're going to be playing that game
today to be here not to be yeah all
right anyway
um speaking of the beer not to be look
I'm verified on my own website and look
I'm verified in the comment section

um anyway look look at those beautiful
colors
no no no no no no no okay whatever uh so
on to our top uh oops uh top headline of
the day uh yeah I'm just really excited
today uh Samsung calculates built into
features tip calculator which is
um much needed in its fight against the
Google Calculator but not as big as
anyway uh here it is right here
you can calculate your tips from Samsung
so you import the percentage of the tip
that you want to pay how much you are
already paid
the subtotal and the amount of people
are actually split them equally
and I will tell you what to do but you
might think oh who calculators do them
can't come back after that uh yes I can
watch this look okay
my phone is locked
oh sorry about that
okay but I'm going to swipe down and no
I don't have fingerprint scanner on
right now uh
behold
the Google Calculator logo hopefully you
can see this
boom I got access to a calculator and if
it works five
plus five
yeah
let's see press five
plus five
it's equal to 29th math am I right
math is beautiful
and it still locks see
great so there you go and you guys might
notice I'm using gboard now uh there we
go uh Samsung Galaxy Strikes Back Again
Samsung Google Google strikes backs
against
you know what I mean anyway look we got
all these tags here probably remove that
and as a last feature for website look
at this
it's just like not the B
anyway
now that we got that mushy lovey-dovey
stuff out we're going to talk about the
new changes happening in the YouTube app
happening in three one thousand four one
thousand five one thousand I'm counting
the wrong way one thousand I'm showing
the wrong screen one thousand all right
I messed up last time and I recorded
this so anyway look hopefully you can
see this um when you click link on in
YouTube it opens up an internal browser
that's based on Chrome uh I think on
Android don't have an iPhone guys if
you'd like to send me an iPhone so I can
test this feature uh
anyway when you open the browser the
three dot icon that used to be on the
right it's now on the left
um
when you open a link in Chrome so when
you open the links down in the
description below
confide in my emotions coming out five
views in it
uh yeah so that's that and also when you
chat in females and live streams the
chat has moved away from the button here
and down here
uh when you tap the icon to check when
you check in the premium like this
premium
I hope you don't have an iPhone keyboard
because you don't even get a number bar
all right and this is one of the last
days I noticed but when you get the
YouTube picture and picture
it still comes up when you open in the
browser on the three little dots on the
left
well that's what I noticed anyway I
don't know uh you can tell me and
speaking of updates I just recently got
a security update on my beautiful
Samsung Galaxy s22 plus that yes is
still running that same skin from
extreme skins not
exploration
sorry about that
um
yeah
the battery life
but you know one thing that I do when it
activates is in power saving mode uh
sorry about that uh here we go see like
my I always keep my phone in power
saving mode power saving mode power
saving mode cool effects anyway I always
keep my phone in oh save it mode because
I like to save power even though Ray
over at 24 Tech
somewhere
anyway wait over at Twin folk Tech
doesn't like power saving mode because
he says if the phone has a feature on
the phone and then you don't have to uh
like if the people included the features
that I'm going to use the features and
as I say that to as a counter
positive mode is a feature
so
whatever okay uh
uh yeah so um
there's that
anyway I want to activate 120 hertz
smooth
scrolling
instead of that boy theme sexy hoods
display screen right the pixel 6A

technologically uh
they are not to be actual headlines okay
here we go be on that to be cool Mom so

get to the more technologically advanced
uh
hey let's see if I'm in the book of
Prophecy you know I have a few words and
prophecies
and I'm probably not good I'm not big
enough for them even though I'm on their
site free of charge of folks anyway uh
worship songs generator I'm gonna show
you this cool Tech I wonder how this
works so it's just I guess it takes how
modern how they how modern worship songs
of written then they satis because the B
and then okay
um
it just it somehow says a database of
words because it has some of the same
words in every song
I just can't even with my first world
problems right now four times so I just
can't even read my first world problems
right now I just can't even move my
first world problems right now I just
can't even with my brother's world
problem okay I'm messing it up so it's

article
which is pretty cool I I have no idea
how they did it but they did it
technologically
impressive
but remember
do I make myself clear
do I
let that be a lesson
to anyone
who tries to steamroll us
