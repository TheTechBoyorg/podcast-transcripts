<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 3125</h1>
<pre>hello everybody Welcome to the this
weekend The Tech booy podcast we have so
much to talk about today from the
nothing phone 3A to some new adventures
and odyssey updates we are taping this
on uh the 1 of the month so there is a
new Club episode that is coming out also
uh you know the Techo media is trying to
get into some new Innovations new um
stuff so we've done some research and
it's kind of hilarious what's been uh
going on over here also we have enough
to uh person doesn't really understand
how technology works so um yeah first of
all let's talk about the nothing phone
3A hope you guys can see this on this on
the screen but when this phone who
designed this I went hands on with the
iPhone SE and um we're going to be
talking about that next week you're G
see a video of me going hands on with
the iPhone S iPhone 16 e sorry but
here's the phone
3A which I think nothing may be leaning
a bit too much into their a series I'm
not sure what do you guys think but this
is the nothing phone 3A and what I have
to say is what in the name of Liz Dorado
quintis Loda is this I mean you have
that telephoto camera right there which
is nice you do get to see that on a
budget phone then we have a flash right
here which why because you have that
here and you got your other cameras this
looks to be a macro camera so it's
probably that good and this other but
this thing looks like a freaking
wireless charging coil that you put on a
uh in the center of the phone also are
these screws is this transparent so it's
a
very interesting design and is going to
be releasing on March 4th 10 o'clock GMT
so who knows what time that is here in
it is running a snap dragon
trip which which
one I I guess we're g to find out more
about that um later I heard that this
phone did almost get stolen uh from
someone that were running and some thief
came up and tried to steal it from
him and
uh you
know it's good that it didn't leak but
let's look at this video the audio is
going to be muted the phone 3 a design
has just been revealed Periscope camera
so I fast
forward okay so they're going to go back
behind here's the concept it doesn't
look like they're going to be telling us
any of the specific so just just look at
this phone what do you guys think it's
very very interesting design uh like
here's a phone here's the nothing phone
2A plus so it's this direct successor
and the 2A as well but I mean look at
this phone you have the you know dual
cameras here kind of Minds HCC uh older
phone here of course this one's in white
last one was in Black you can get this
one in black as well it just still have
to transparent design um there is a
flash still there so I guess they
what
happened but there is a Flash and we do
have these little LEDs here but I mean I
think this design is a bit more
aesthetically pleasing
oh this one's actually neat looking like
kind of looks like you're going
undercover night vision goggles you know
that that actually looks nice um what do
you guys think about the nothing phone
2A plus nothing phone 2A versus the
nothing phone I guess uh 3A that's going
to be released maybe we'll get to see
some premium premium specs on the side
all right now we do have this new Banner
here um blah blah blah sweet likes to
debate finding R but loves Jesus also
Tech and teen media account let's focus
in on that teen media account for a
little bit here back to nothing phone 2A
we've been looking into trying to start
a teen magazine uh for teens because you
know the magazines that we have out for
teen boys today I don't have Brio if I
had access to Brio you know we could use
that and weaponize it against our
enemies but I don't have access to Brio
I probably can predict what it's going
to say hey modesty is a state of heart
not just a state of mind blah blah blah
y y y mod blah blah blah right whatever
I don't have boo but you know that's
probably what it would say I do have
focus on the family Clubhouse magazine
but I mean aside from that I'm not
showing you my address aside from that
um that is all we
have uh you know in the Evangelical teen
magazine space right so I was thinking
you know um I always like to see if we
can uh do something that's not been done
before or go out and uh make something
if I can't have it myself for
example um this is going to become a key
s ltw plot um I helped figure out
legislation that would allow me to go to
uh Babbling Brook Mall uh with uh Denver
in April um for the sa ltw series
another example when I got kicked off of
ntp I said I'm going to bring you guys a
new social media website and now we have
notthe boy.com make sure you guys go
check that out Matt W uh said that there
wasn't some type of database you'll see
this in postproduction so um I'm not
sure if I can say it on YouTube so I
went out and made it myself I made my
own Tech website so I could get acquire
my own cell phone and be able to review
cell phones and guess what guys I was
able to do that as well so um if there's
something that is out there I always
like to go out there and go acquire It
Go beat it because I can beat any one at
their own game and that's why the tech
War media is trying to expand into even
so much more for instance you know the
model Beauty uh
fashion space of course we couldn't
break into that but we released AA Haro
and once a get more followers we're
going to have a Instagram influencer
model Attic So we are going to be able
to go anywhere and do anything as
America's leading conserva Tech company
all right anyway this is just a long
spill to say something about 17 magazine
so 17 magazine is a pounding I I looked
it up a magazine for teens I was like
okay okay I want to see what our
competition looks like and it is as
brainless and dead as possible
apparently boys don't read magazines so
of course that's all we have is
Clubhouse magazine but there is a ple of
teen girl magazines out there which is
just a deranged Instagram feed with
stupid stupid stupid headline so imagine
you know like the New York Post but like
for teen
girls and uh that's that's uh that's
what we got here so this is this is 17
magazine this is this should be a
competition should I release a teen
magazine and you know we already do
focus on entertainment with the Odyssey
boy we need to start writing that again
after ssw is finished we finish up the
series because there's a actual time
date built into it because it's based
off real event so we can't just go
extrapolate and go make stuff up well
we're going to make a tiny bit of stuff
up but
um 99% of it is
true it will be done and then we can
keep it we'll C Force keep it online
maybe we put some ads on it and you guys
can go read it of course we have the
book I'm thinking about starting a new
book um it'll pick up right after the
series leaves off so you'll have the SS
ltw book you have the SS ltw website
which of course is a bit more accurate
the book goes from September to November
then the website goes from August
to uh May of 2024 and then have a time
Jump
to September is of
20204 and then that's it the series ends
and that's something big happens that I
get involved with and then um after you
know September then the new book book
two will pick up after September and
it's just going to kind of map out what
would e sh do after becoming president
of growing high and he is president of
course probably W release a book with
him as president
because
ssw the book ssw the election is
actually based on real events that
actually happened right but the events
post you know since Ethan Shay became
president that would dramatically alter
everything that happened in December
January February March for May June Etc
right like in you know November you know
you have Molly over here yapping about
you know smacking cids in the face with
the hydro flasks yeah that that probably
wouldn't be happening if Ethan was
present but you know um also you know
there's this whole thing about funding
and this comp this competition that's
going on etc etc right so it would be
kind of hard to mesh what
happens in the web series to see what
happens in the book series because you
know the series happens in September the
in the book series happens in November
so it's it's easy but we can't keep
pushing it back and back and back but
anyway here 17 magazine and
is ridiculous like my my team based
content like the Odyssey boy focusing on
Odyssey and other audio dramas and now
team television shows um also you know I
do talk about a lot of tub movies on
here and 17 versus 17 17 is trash okay
no one cares about this
Za Wade person okay I think that's a
your boy by the
way like bro we we will never run okay I
can assure you the techboy media will
never run a stupid stupid article like
this just don't okay we will never run
an article like
this bro I mean look this the first time
I've seen this in like a month are you
kidding me are you kidding me these
people actually make money a list of qu
and trans resources to consult for
support Aid and
more good
Heavens this magazine sucks a brief
history of the okay even if you are
lgbtq plus whatever which no one
actually is but let's just let's just
you know go go along with what they're
say here let's just go along for a
little bit does anyone you think those
teams are actually I gotta check out
what 17 magazine is saying about this no
okay guys no one cares no one cares no
one cares literally no one cares bro if
I was pres I just cancel prom all
together no you don't get a problem uh
and absolutely no one
cares why why is this on a magazine
that's meant for I mean I'm going to you
know I guess I'm kind of smart you know
have the ability to read why is this on
a magazine meant for um
17y old girls I'm just getting that from
from the
okay sorry sorry if uh if there you go
and then you have this so you have this
absolutely drained junk blah blah blah
and then you have these oh well who's
doing what at some actress event some
random guys is leaving some K-pop group
that no one cares about what does BTS
mean which the only reason I know I care
about them is because they released some
purple Samsung Galaxy s20 plus phone
which S2 Plus phone absolutely amazing
had a time of flight sensor 6.7 in curv
display Edge screen like we had that the
S21 oh and micro SD card the S21 plus
was such a downgrade from that phone I'm
not even kidding like it had like a
plastic a black which is I kind of
defend it at the time back then but you
know in terms of pre premium materials
that's dang and then you know S21 plus
you lost your time of flight sens don't
even have that on the Ultras anymore why
do we not have our time of flight senses
anymore we have our little laser
autofocus censes but on the time of
flight senses I was you know traveling
this is back in 2023 when I was on the
robotics team which is
anyway we can do a deep dive on that you
know I always talk about like you oh why
all these Pride flags on here anyway
back I I was on the robotic team and
this kid had the Samsung Galaxy Note 10
plus the Note 10 plus had a Time flight
center and had this 3D scanning
application that was built offline this
is in
2019 uh it's in 2023 but the phone was
built in 2019 and he was available he
was able to make a 3D scan actually I
was he didn't know about this but I was
able to make a 3D scan of him or his
face or whatever while we were sitting
on the bus yeah I had nothing literally
nothing else to do but I mean my phone
is infinitely more powerful than the
Note 10 plus got the Samsung Galaxy s24
Ultra here right and the only thing that
is used for is literally reading x and
um of course making phones communication
Etc all of those things can be done on a
$200 phone plus uh doing some light
video editing because for some reason
even though my computer has 3 gabes of
ram Intel Core i7 Evo i7 it it sucks at
Video Edit
anyway why can we not 3D scan offline on
the devices anymore literally
why that's that's probably even a bigger
Scandal than this trash website itself
which I can do better anything they can
do I can do a lot better first of all I
can do a lot better just by like wiping
half the website like wiping this
section and that and that and that and
that like I don't understand how they're
in business like imagine you're a teen
girl imagine you're a team girl
right you know you got your your apps
you got your Snapchat
you got your Instagram you got your Tik
Tok
maybe and then you're like you know
sometimes I have to go on to
um fasten NOA yes see spending time uh
listening to gcam taping
them learn you learn lots of things you
have to go to the fashion no whatever
the shine or whatever the fashion
website is because I don't have the app
you know I don't want to be addicted to
this app which fine whatever so you pull
out your iPhone always an iPhone never
an Android you put it out you type it
in and you order your stuff and you're
like yes I got to check out 17 magazine
and it's just a whole bunch of
hairstyles and celebrity news of
celebrities I've never heard about
except for Addison way because she was
in that Livy video of her pretending
well actually was Livy pretending to be
Addison way sing the national anthem who
the heck is
Olivia Olivia Rodrigo
isn't he like satanic or
something I can't
remember uh Sabrina
C she's like a singer I
think how is this an article 11 breakup
text are are genuine but get straight to
the point imagine you're about to break
up of someone which and there we go
again he needs dating threat to National
Security and ailure rate hints you know
getting into a magazine like I I'm
pretty sure magazine used to be a lot
better back then imagine you you're
about going to a breakup and you go to
17 magazine and you're like yeah guys uh
I got to check this out let's check out
what the um breakup Tex are it's better
than
ghosting blah blah blah man they
are this is this is really really great
and they wonder why Chad CPT is probably
going to steal their job who's the
secret delivia Rodrigo Bambi
lashes millions and millions of dollars
all right next a Legally Blonde preo
cast young L Woods huh okay see that's
actually interesting ending to The
Wicked part one explained out of bank
season four ending
explained are these people blind can
they not watch a show and
S who is Black build on out of banks TV
shows to watch if you love out of banks
Wicked movie part two has an early
release date I mean this is really
interesting imagine you have the
internet they call this thing a magazine
this looks like a bunch of okay cila
Cabella with vintage ruffle mini dress I
do not care or know who this person
is okay I
I I I I
I I don't care if she dressed
up like a puppy and had a pink hat on I
I really don't care and I don't think
anyone else cares either and also how is
this a news
article like are these people are they
blind can a vintage ruffle mini dress
yes we can all see that from the picture
that you stole from her Instagram okay
imagine if if you're a celebrity and you
post some pictures to your Instagram and
then you have 170 magazine coming in
here writing an entire long article
yapping about what we can all plainly
see in front of our eyes Cam that she
wore a vintage ruffle mini dress now I
don't know that it's a vintage ruffle
mini dress because I I I wouldn't know
that but you know I'm pretty sure the
readers of 17 magazine each know the 17
different types of dresses that are
available to them anyway this magazine
is absolutely garbage and trash but the
point of this is that we as a society
need to have better magazines and better
websites for for teenagers right I think
teenager entertainment is
overlooked right of course you know we
got our adventures and odyssey we got
our you know all our radio programs we
got our uh clubhouse magazine right
that's great but everyone's not GNA be
watching focus on the family
unfortunately I mean they even cut that
show uh what's that show called McGee
and me yeah it's from the 90s right
where where is the good entertainment
content for teens that's not say on
Instagram Tik Tok Snapchat
Etc speaking of Instagram Tik Tok
Snapchat um there's this woman who's
saying let me see if I can pull it
up see
she again doesn't understand how these
communication apps are used which is
fine but I mean if you try to like try
to legislate stuff speaking of
legislation I heard that Sarah Huckabee
governor of Arkansas just banned cell
phones in school not in classroom it's
fine whatever like what are you going to
do with the cell phone in classroom but
it's just b band it from Bell to Bell
which is utterly assine and stupid like
please no don't van cell phones from uh
Bell to bill please don't okay um like
what do you want them to do at lunch
okay as long as they're not holding
anyone just let them use a cell phone
fall that's good all right
anyway BX BX on X says these great
profound
words she she she is so smart
quote keep your kids and teens away from
messaging apps like Discord Telegram and
Snapchat there's absolutely no reason
for them to talk to strangers online
it's best to keep them off the internet
entirely but you must do everything in
your power to keep them off messaging
apps now you might say oh wow she sounds
so sane she sounds so great Until you
realize that okay no team except for me
is on telegram okay T telegram is not
even popular amongst the
teens but okay remember teens try to
play like they're complex but they're
not okay they're remarkably simple once
you get to understand them they're
remarkably simple teenagers are not
using SnapChat this let's do this app by
app backwards Snapchat is not used to
snap random strangers that you have
never met in your life it's not like
you're in some AOL chat room Circa 2005
or like this party line I heard about
this blind hacker who would go after
people on these party lines which was
essentially a large conference call with
all these people on it on the phone
right and use like chat rooms you
wouldn't know who's in it or who's
behind it that is not what Snapchat is
used for Snapchat is used primarily as
an alternative to like phone number with
like deleted
messages uh interesting little filters
and the absolute worst reals of all time
right but yeah in order to snap someone
you have to know what their snap ID is
and other than really Mega popular stars
like on Instagram who might have
Snapchat TW just didn't on to respond to
there's just there like I guess you can
send them memes or make money or
whatever you in order to you you have to
get someone's Snapchat there's this
phenomenum in high school right High
School J little expert here there's this
phenomenum in high school where you have
to get quote a girl's snap or something
like that which means you have to know
them in person to get said snap right
Snapchat is essentially like a phone
it's a phone number but teens like it
because it has F TOs and other features
and also um it works over Wi-Fi so the
teens that don't have unlimited data
plans can can use it to text their
friends and that's what it's is for
texting
friends now you can't say that teenagers
are posting inappropriate stuff on
Snapchat which some probably are I mean
for some re and teens like to post
inappropriate stuff
but it it is like a phone number okay
and there are no uh let's go with the
phone and N here you know in the old
days you had phone books that listed
every number in your city there are no
snap books that list every snap account
in your city in order to get someone
snap most of the time most of the time
most of the time you have to know them
in person or at least know of them and
you would know if they are a teen or
some random stranger millions and
millions of miles away okay so once
again she does not know what she's
talking about here and it's always the
people who don't know what they're
talking about trying to legislate
technology like sah Huckabee Rhonda
Sanchez Kathy holel all these people
these Governors and
stuff stay in your
lanes Sant the santis hakabe F great
great Governors whatever stay in your
lanes and let the the people who know
technology do the technology stuff BX
stay in your lane and go out there and
do whatever you do on
X but
please okay that that's not what
Snapchat's for all telegram
again yeah there these things called
telegram channels but they're all public
uh and also for Discord Discord channels
mostly public you can get
DMS it but it it's more for chat rooms
based around a specific Community okay I
me know some chat rooms where it's like
in open which is fine because all the
messages are open and Discord does have
some filtering filter into
it but for for the teens are just
yapping the strangers on the
internet which I I mean bye-bye email I
guess and uh bye-bye to me and know my
entire business is literally predicated
on talking to strangers on the internet
that's how I got the devices that I need
to test and review but you know my
business is just dead in fact I should
have stayed offline and shouldn't have
started this company in 2020 I should
have waited into 2024 when I turned 18
you know this should be like my fourth
podcast episode people you should have
no idea who I am right because anyone
with the modum of
intelligence like half smart teens are
not going to be getting caught up in
this ridiculous
stuff like I'm
sorry but you know the you hear do
stories about people who get
scammed uh who send like illicit photos
to
people bro I I really do not the appeal
of
that
why I'm sorry yeah those teams should
not be on the internet if you are and
this is gonna sound inflammatory that
dumb no you should not be on the
internet you just shouldn't be you
probably shouldn't even be allowed to be
in the library like used to be sitting
at
home like it locked in a room but please
don't lock all the best team in the room
because of these idiot people actions
and especially if you're an adult who
how what kind of ridiculous scam okay
the scam predicates that you send elicit
photos to people that you don't know in
exchange for their elicit
photos and then of course the poting
random person in Nigeria and they try to
ruin your life with it and they try to
extort you thousands maybe even millions
of dollars right that's how the scam
predicates that's how it
works except the entire premise of the
scam is
just insane
like even if it is someone that you
actually know in real life you could
let's say that you can see them actually
texting so you know it's not like
someone hacked their
account why why would you send illicit
photos of yourself to someone
else and let's even let's even back this
up why would you even take those photos
in the first
place in exchange to see someone else's
elicit photos first of all why would you
give someone undo leverage over you
second why do you even want to see
elicit
photos third of all why why would you
send and take them in the first place
and then when you have to scam where
some random AI generated person or some
profile pictures they see you're like oh
wow oh wow she's so pretty and she want
some listed photo me I've never met or
heard of this person a day in my life
yeah I'm definitely gonna send this is
definitely not a scam uhhuh yep happens
millions and millions I'm sorry but I
cannot film sympathy or even show I have
a hard time feeling sympathy empy
whatever to to you like that's just
brain dead at that point brain dead and
even if you send it to them even if you
do that how is anyone gonna prove that
those elicit photos of
you you could just say oh my account was
hacked oh that's not my account that's a
that's that's a spoof I mean there
scamers for crying out
loud I feel a little Sympathy for the
people who have those photos just like
save locally window hard drive and then
they get hacked I don't know why you
take the photos in the first place but I
mean you didn't ask they get hacked
right you didn't ask for them to get
leaked these people literally asked and
you gave it to
them yeah those people shouldn't be on
the internet but the rest of the teens
that are normal yeah please be yeah they
can be on the internet like that's just
in
insane it's insane and
stupid and it's just going to be this
hype and paranoia that happens all the
time which it doesn't just be smart I do
not feed into the Santas or BX or
uh
hucke hands just just be normal don't
send elicit photos to people and
especially random Nigerian scamers
there's so much good that we can
do but no
you you know teenek teenek is is is is
mad right now you know the these are the
people that lobbied for Tik Tok to
get unbanned for 75 days and I'm the
lobbying against her so yes te just
don't don't don't be stupid okay just
just don't just just don't you know guys
guys you you can never have illicit
photos of you leaked if you never take
illicit
photos
Grand I know mindblowing U people
mind-blowing um there will never be a
leak of me because it it can't happen if
if you don't take sad
photos absolutely astounding and
mindblowing people speaking of
astounding and mindblowing we have some
sad news for you guys like I was saying
focus on the family Clubhouse magazine
and the club we have a new episode today
but that's all going to be ending soon
after album 0 Advent and odyssey has
confirmed in a podcast episode that they
will no longer sell digital rcd
downloads of episodes so you still be
able to get the old ones download the
old ones get the old ones and CDs but
they won't refresh
them which means that essentially
offline listening unless you have the
club is dead everything is going to go
to the club or the radio now there is
some good news in This Club episodes are
going to be month episodes anymore in
fact because you have to have the club
to listen to every
episode uh Club episodes are just going
to become a bit more intergrated within
the series and we've even started to see
this with why BEC a Christian on a Club
episode so that's that's interesting
because you know normally you wouldn't
have major life changes on the Club
episode but essentially the club is GNA
become the hub for all of Odyssey
everything is going to be
Cannon but you won't be able to get any
downloads or CDs of it anymore which is
kind of sad though I do think this is
interesting because this may mean that
you'll finally get to here you know you
always have the new album you get two
new albums a year nowadays so back the
club I listen to it on the radio and it'
be the best 12 weeks of my life six
weeks there six weeks there but the rest
of the don't want to sound stupid here
30 38 weeks yeah 38 weeks you know they
keep learning me ons and me ons and I
was fine when I started listening The
Odyssey when I had in my opinion the
best album you know green ring
conspiracy plus uh the ties That Bine
ties at Bine being the best album you
know they also played some novacom ones
daily so I listen to that on my
tablet but once you hear all the
episodes it it would have been nice to
hear some of the Club episodes on the
radio maybe like a month a few months a
year afterwards but with this decline of
DVDs and downloads maybe they'll have
Club episodes come on to the radio short
so listen to the radio you know people
who only listen to the radio might be
able to hear some episodes that they've
never heard before which I think is
interesting I do think that if focus is
going to do that they should get their
Club technology a lot better than having
some outages and if this is the only way
that you can listen to Odyssey I don't
think that's good also you know you kind
have some people like oh we want to get
away from screens and of course that
means I guess you have to wait it for on
the radio because you can't listen to it
on your CD player you can't listen to it
I guess
downloaded digital download so that's
kind of sad maybe the backlash
will convince Focus to still sell CDs or
at least digital BS I think still should
still at least digital downloads hike
the prices on a bit so that maybe you
can push more members to the club but it
cost them nothing to have digital
downloads anyway this talk about what it
was like to be a teen in the 2000s part
one and this is kind of ties into our
whole magazine
idea which I'm I'm really interested in
especially after that disaster 17
magazine which is not for children it's
not for anyone but like what do teens do
this is this is what they of was asking
of this article what do teams do for fun
like I said there seems to be a stunning
lack of Team entertainment uh out there
what do you guys think no I'm not
getting any chats
but of course oh yeah here we have 17
magazine here is a physical copy of
Haven magazine holiday 150 dreams come
true best CDs ever secrets of the SAT
the best boy band Dre way more after
dark that kind of seems a l more a bit
more interesting then this I save my
Dad's life is he W keeping for the sumu
Accord I have these stupid quizzes but I
want to think about starting some
quizzes as
well uh 17 magazine these people talking
about keeping up to date it tells you
everything you need to know about the
teen World which really really seems
movie tuby movie like 25es
stereotypical right recommended acne
products biggest hit songs of the
month Destiny's Child I thought that was
one person apparently it's multiple
because it's multiple members you know
the more you know the more we
learn I
mean is this interesting why do you
think is influencing teenss today what
do you guys
think you have these room decor which is
also inspired by
magazines um you know I think that the
internet is a really really good thing
uh for society it's a really really good
Improvement but I don't think that we
have enough websites anymore to do
anything oh wow we do get have some chat
chill hi Kate says Hi um I think she's
an actress or a single who who's an
actress or I sing I missed this I missed
your chat messages sorry um anyway I'm
gonna put this into the chat there you
go this is the uh blog article you guys
can go read this itself but I think that
the internet um has done things
that are really really good for society
I think it's a really really good thing
but I don't think that we have enough
websites anymore everything's been kind
of and I'm G to actually give a decent
criticism of Snapchat and Instagram and
these communication apps other than oh
well team may do something stupid and
they should be just I guess you know
they magically become sane and smart as
soon as they tun 18 like you know as
soon as they tun 18 they can use the
Discord you know they they they won't
fall cre any scams anymore oh no sir no
sir yesterday oh oh yeah they they were
going to get scammed hard but today
they're wise
enlightened in fact
anyway like there's not enough websites
14s there's not enough entertainment
websites anywhere they're actually
interesting like we looked at the 17
website that wasn't interesting it was
degenerate I mean it should have been
boned by uh Sodom and gamorra you know
we should have like had had it getting
legally take taken out by
someone uh not someone by uh God Legally
Legally firebombing Doo okay that that's
what should happen to 17 magazine s or
at least the uh lgbtq section of it I
mean if you want to read about what some
actors
will be my
guest but uh yeah they need to be more
like interesting content out there and
I've actually seen this I actually
turned history on YouTube I found
I found something interesting
on found interesting stuff on YouTube so
I I guess I recommend keeping your
YouTube history turned on because it's
actually giving me some interesting
video essays which I am going to be
releasing a video essay on Monday this
would be the Monday Tech article about
the downfall of MSN Microsoft network
Microsoft network used to be really big
they even had devices that you could buy
um that just gave you access to the
internet which I mean we probably need
those today now like back then I guess
you know you wanted a decent desktop but
now no one really does anything on
computers anymore like if you just want
to have access to your internet that's
good but of course you know MSN is
garbage let's let's go over to the I
think I can go to the MSN home page here
msn.com you know no one goes to this on
purpose they do have an app it's also
trash
uh MSN is also the default head homepage
of edge which is again
trash they used to have these web
portals here that would lead you to
things but this this is what Emon looks
like now guys I like I'm not in favor of
killing features but um you know if this
one died I don't think anyone want it
anyway here is MSN
add
okay what why does the NS how often you
turn off your phone but okay another
ad okay that's interesting I guess
another ad
another
ad big whoop oh yeah Skype is dying so
sad
um okay that's an interesting article
there another
ad no no one
cares no one
cares definitely no one
cares um okay you have these trash news
articles some ad here here
some essentially another ad thing here
another more trash news articles some
more ads and of course you know you got
your being search that no one no one
uses you got your web and of course
let's look at the website too
Facebook trash online games
outlook.com no trash just utterly
utterly trash all right let's see if
there's something on YouTube that we can
watch I know mr's the boss at the video
because we have to make this go be be an
hour and I think there's one more thing
I still have to talk about once again my
computer for some reason is super duper
slow like I don't know why it's so slow
when it's like the oh apple is planning
on building a factor for its uh servers
that have apple intelligence here in
Houston Texas so that's that's
interesting let's see what
um let's see what Mr who's boss has
see all right let
me let me pick it
up
Mr who's the
boss he bought the ultimate survival
technology and are you guys interested
in that Kate what are you interested
in should just Happ instead actually no
let's not talk about that let's talk
about the Oppo Find in that's that's a
lot more interesting than survival Tech
in my opinion though his video was good
all right let's
go look how slow this
is Oppo has just launched aable phone
you guys can hear or at least I can hear
what you guys are hearing
so thin it only just fits a USBC Port
I'm not exaggerating the inside of a
USBC Port is 2.4 mm 2.4 millim right
there once you add in the structural
housing you get to about 4 mm the Oppo
Find
N5 headphone track in there but they
didn't in fact there's this really
really skinny FIFA phone from like 2014
had a headphone jack and it was
literally coming out of the pH I think
we we need to keep lobbying back for the
return of the headphone jack
especially on our folding phones I
wasn't like e this doesn't matter
because folding phones are become you
know main Gene back in like 2019 um it
was I was fine with them not having a
headphone jack or SD card slot back then
but now that you know ow that they're
you know becoming more modern you know
the the size of regular slab phones they
should have all the features other the
slab phones took away a few years ago as
well so bring back the slot bring back
the MicroSD also for folding phones you
have this whole problem other than
what are you going to do other than
watch videos like we need to have more
productive applications come to our
devices I've been going I've been saying
this we use upon use upon
use we need more applications that can
harness this power my video editor of
choice also is locked motion nja is
locked in the vertical so I mean what I
can open up four instances of motion
injured like side by side on a folding
phone it's not really useful um we we we
need to have more applications that
leverage this and that's the same thing
on PCS as well like it's computer
technology
like what do you guys think
anyway come
on Stick when unfolded and somehow
that's not even the best bit it's also
meant to be much faster than the
competition with a longer battery better
especially for you know a phone that has
I'm really gonna have to stutter this
down 360p especially a phone that has um
you know dual dual screens you got have
to have a good battery in it as well I
don't understand why Samsung has two
,200 Milah hour shells in its fold makes
sense in the flip why in The Fold why
does it have a smaller battery than the
s25 ultra or s24
Ultra cameras along with just a whole
load of tech that no one expected like
new signal enhancement the most powerful
image generation that I've ever seen on
a phone it's interesting but I mean look
at this Watermark this this does give a
like a Chinese esque uh vibe to it you
know that's how the Chinese fo design
design the software this I mean I have
the watermark be in the corner like
Samsung hopefully you can like erase it
offline so that no one has to see this
also this he just looks like a piece of
clay andless has just the bad video quad
thing that I had to set it
to and even the ability to integrate
into the Apple ecosystem so let's pit it
head-to-head against Samsung who makes
the best selling foldables to find out
they sell here in the United States
Apple doesn't sell their phones
in fact for the global release I think
it's just the Asia and a few European
countries like you'd have to sell a
phone to everyone in Asia to out compete
against Samsung which can sell phones to
everyone in the
world is actually about to Massacre the
market and right from the off OPP lands
its very first blow when it comes to the
unboxing cuz this is what you get an 80
the original zold box I mean those were
selling for like um $35 on eBay probably
even more um no it had a like nice
little z z design I'm trying to see if I
can pull it up um but let's see if I can
show it to you
guys so here's a picture of mkbhd's
unboxing of it here you can see how it
kind of like opens up a little bit I
think it even had like a z design in
there um and the boxes were a lot bigger
they did send some stuff in with it as
well a charger Chargers are always
common in the boxes so you know unbox
ing for the quote unquote environment uh
has um been been trash so good to see
Oppo um do do it better uh then Samsung
on this one right here also I do like um
I guess this would be a hot tape I do
like can use you know probably not now
but at least a few years ago USB Char
you can use anyone's cable like most
people probably um depending on how old
you I carry around a regular USB a to c
or see a a lightning cable rather than
that so that that is nice in my
opinion the a Toc cable and a case which
does feel preium but also very light I
guess that makes sense since designing a
phone like this and then slapping a
chunk Meister case onto it would car a
phone case that has a 10,000 Milah hour
battery just from new not sponsored but
they did send this to me to review guys
can go check that on out on the tech.org
now compare that to Samsung's package
which literally just come with the phone
and a USBC cable you're getting about
$80 of extra free value in the box with
Oppo plus pre-install screen protector
on the front which is one of those
things that use the screen protective
with my phone before my phone have been
pretty pretty durable it's up the s22
plus but I did drop on concrete it did
slide 50 ft so that was my fault there I
didn't drop it it fell in my pocket uh
a715g it dropped on concrete to totally
fine it didn't have that glasstic design
uh s254 Ultra again great
design come
on them about 50 cents to do but to you
the user it's one fairly major less
thing that you need to worry about and
you know what Oppo continues the
onslaught when it comes put this down
even a little bit more let's do a
240 and his video still look good in 240
to the build and it ain't close both
phones have a that is nice what do you
guys think about the build because you
know I've seen this video before oppo's
going to win win this round but I mean
look if you look at here this does
remind me of this 24 Ultra but when you
go hand on it is skinnier but I mean
when you see this thing here you have
that little like curve thing so it's
kind of like the uh hmd phone that's
kind of like repairable but has like a
oval screen inside of a square body or
whatever what do you guys think about
this CU like technically screen the body
ratio on Samsung would be better right
depends on how skinny the bezels
are aluminium alloy frame they both got
fantastic feeling hinges that allow you
to stop at almost any point in the
motion but then it kind of feels like
Oppo runs away with it their front
display is imbued with ceramic which
we've seen on quite a few phones does
increase structural strength it's got
better water resistance while Samsung's
phone can take immersion this thing can
go further and actually take high
pressure
features but what foldable phone is it
supposed to be like a freed foldable
phone like since when does your phone
ever have to be used in Jets now a
feature that I would like to see OnePlus
does have this feature is uh being able
to be used in domain right touch screen
on the because you know that's a good
thing that oh speaking of keyboard
phones are coming back there's a clicks
case for Android now unfortunately not
for s24 Ultra is one for the s25 ultra
which is 0.1 in is bigger but it
probably would fit it probably would fit
but I don't have $130 in cash so if you
guys want to send that over to me please
please do do so if you guys send in $130
I'll cash it out and buy the case but
you know this is one thing that if
you're able to potentially get a
waterproof keyboard case or at least
something like that tactile
buttons like the S5 it was tactile I
know it had touchcreen but had tactile
buttons um it it would be nice to be
able to have like the sense of
durability that a physical phone
has physical buttons Etc and you can use
it like in in the ring like when it gets
wet
wet and extreme temperatures to bootan
that is nice especially for the region
you know like Asia you know it's C in
China Russia what are some other cold
Asian countries oh Al like all of Europe
so you know that that is nice foro thing
also you know Northern USA if they sort
them but they don't so
come
on for my extreme
lifestyle and just zooming out for a
second the fact that it's even close let
alone ahead in terms of durability is
quite insane considering that Oppo is
also almost 30% th most of those
durability
improvements other than like the water
stuff is because actually the water
stuff might be because it's different
because the Hing is closer together it's
because ceramic screen and shield
display technology that they have on
there part thanks to some careful
re-engineering of the motherboard it's
10 G lighter all while having a
significantly less visible crease than
Samsung saying crease on this phone Les
visible at least from this I mean here
here's a perfect example of like what
are you going to be using your phone for
this is the OU of display of one of the
most powerful phones in the world these
look like op apps here um like phones
that come pre-install the applicate with
the phone and you got your Google Apps
here you got the Play Store you got
Google me and then of course the key
apps here we got Tik Tok why is Tik Tok
on here twice look it's Tik Tok there
it's Tik Tok there I guess he he really
didn't want it to get banned you got
Facebook Messenger Instagram which why
have both and then you have
lift like these are not powerful
applications is 10% narrower and 50%
shallower than the cre on their last
phone which was already great it doesn't
look that different to me but it's
clearly vastly superior to the P camera
in the coru it doesn't really matter
left right or whatever because you can
flip it what you guys think PCH camera
in the coru OR pch in centu but
invisible you will notice every
time you look at all the phones like say
that Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge from 2016
the camera was actually in the corner
it's just that you couldn't really see
it because it's had a whole battle on it
so that's actually an interesting thing
that I wanted to talk about but it's not
I guess it's not really relevant anymore
because they don't do phone cameras like
that anymore so
said when you use this phone for the
first time it is absolutely one of those
moments that just makes you peer back
over at the Samsung and truly reconsider
how much this company is actually trying
the only two downsides on the Oppo are
that one they've had to place the glass
on the back for a thinner fiber material
I mean I'd be fine with you know some
more materials coming to the back of pH
you know LG used to do
Le wood on
motor which they've masked pretty well
with this whole marbly texture but does
still feel a little plasticky and then
two that for some reason while Oppo
decided to completely full send this
thing in terms of water resistance
they've actually got no certification in
terms of dust resistance interesting I
would think that having dust resistance
and regular water resistance would be
more important having Jets like are are
you bringing this phone to a waterf and
taking it down water
slides like what do you guys think is it
more likely that your phone would die
from like getting shot at with the jet
which I'm pretty sure Samsung take a jet
don't site me on that okay if your phone
breaks don't come consuming I produc
Samsung phone could take a jet for a
little bit you know maybe like half as
long as the
Oppo but like if you go to the beach
your phone is dead what what's more
likely your phone dies bya a water hose
or your phone dies because you went to
the beach I I'd say via Beach so that is
kind of weird
though also you know dust is all around
us why do jets on night well at the very
least Samsung does have a basic IP
4 but then you take the phones out into
the real world and start to no no jets
that are coming and attacking
him kind of unusual when it comes to
battery so the Oppa uses a brand new
type of battery that we we've only
really started seeing recently a silicon
carbon battery with
the6 silicon content so far you can
think of silicon carbon batteries as
just more energy dense than traditional
lithium ion batteries and so what this
means is that within less space this
phone has managed to squeeze in a five
Samsung really put a 5,000 m battery
course because the split because of
physics or whatever you know 5,000 m
battery on this is not going to be as
good as 5,000 if we want a slab
phone um so it's fine on the flip series
of devices because you can do like 90%
of everything you need to do on a 3.5 in
screen which is kind of indic indicative
of mobile technology but you know on
these type of phones you have a regular
phone is 85% of a regular phone taped to
like a miniature tablet and this phone
is beating it by 1,200 Milli battery
that that's insane and that's even if we
give it the benefit of the Dow that's
still 1,000 if you were to take like
2,000 M hours on it you know the batter
just split between
halv come on
,600 Mah capacity compared to Samsung's
4,4 400 that's a massive difference now
I did find that if you push both phones
to their limit then the Oppo will still
actually drain just as fast as the
Samsung and that kind of makes sense
given that the chip on this phone can
draw more power and silicon carbon
batteries are better at providing that
power but if you assume average use B
ging what is even this demo like who
opens up Instagram starts scrolling it
there is Instagram I think and then like
opens up Play Store I've never done
that social media bit of browsing and
music Oppo will Outlast 10 out of 10
over a th000 milli hours bigger so you
know it'd be kind of sad if if the
batteries within like I don't know 200
milliamp hours and it just be soft
optimization but you know those phones
even if terrible optimization with 6,000
M hour battery should last longer than
the phone with 4,000 M battery
not to mention the other flip side of
this more conductive battery is faster
charging while Samsung takes around 90
minutes to fully charge
OPP so embarassing for Samsung because
their battery is smaller and oppo's
battery is bigger so you know Samsung
said be winning at least tying this
think remember in that time it's
charging up a
25% bigger cell plus faster wireless
charging too 50 wats versus 50 I do
wonder that with the circle camera right
here how hard would it be to get on the
charger you know there's no such such
thing as Max safe on here so I like to
see how how what it does
to frankly it's just embarrassing for
Samsung since Oppo is doing all that
with a new coil specifically made for
the phone because it's 40% thinner than
normal okay so that notice that TV like
this is Samsung TV it's called the frame
I believe great art pieces on it kind of
looks real like look at this it's brown
around there that's a
TV too zero to Samsung but fine
Samsung's got screens at least right I
mean that's kind of what they do
literally every TV in this house is a
Samsung
TV nope and it's really funny because
Oppo has kind of just pulled a Samsung
here so when you open both phones up
you'll immediately notice that oppos is
the bigger screen it's higher resolution
speaking creaseless but as well as that
you know that anti-reflective screen
coating that Samsung's kind of become
famous for on their S Series flagships
well Oppo has employed something very
similar on their inner display here and
Samsung hasn't this isn't quite as
effective as the anti-reflective coting
Samsung uses on their bar phones I guess
it makes sense because this a bit more
plasticky you can see it here though
I've been hands on with this phone I
haven't really noticed anything it could
just be the lighting I haven't taken it
outside you know say in the Samsung
store but it's better than the no
coating that they have on their
foldables actually making Oppo now the
one with the more readable screen oh
yeah and the Oppo also has the better
cover screen on the front see if you
look at Samsung in isolation it feels
like they're making really good progress
here their first foldable look like this
this and each generation we've seen this
cover screen get a little bigger a
little closer to the edges and the hinge
on the side being pulled in to more and
more closely resemble just a normal bar
but it's only when you put it side by
side with the Oppo that you're reminded
oh yeah this this is a bar phone Oppo is
wide enough to feel like a genuinely
natural aspect ratio for typing here you
can see it in the better shot there you
have your you have your Curve screen but
a bit more back Stu as well would be
nice if there like an antenna or
something way is almost the exact same
as a standard iPhone 16 Pro Maxes are
heavy you know have the titanium Flame
the glass back and 6 point like seven
eight maybe nine inches
phone thickness too so I don't feel like
I'm carrying around a third leg in my
pocket and so seeing that you can have
all of that that suddenly reminds you
Samsung isn't quite there I don't really
like these two weird looking corners and
also I'd like to see what the screen to
body ratio of that is if they even
consider a bezel up they consider that
like
housing's displays are a bit brighter
when you're Outdoors but you know if I
had to pick one oh
what about the inner screen is it
brighter come
on man this is this is taking all
day how I guess we can go lower here we
go
144 I would still on balance prefer the
oppo's set of
screens so it's turning into a bit of a
blood bath right now blood what about
performance blood bath
yeah the opp has too the things the as
this phone came out in like
2025 and Samsung came out summer
2024
so Snapdragon 8 Elite chip as opposed to
the Samsung which uses last year this is
basically powered by the thing that you
could expect Samsung's next foldable
that will come out in the summer to be
powered by and so it's not hugely
surprising to see that it came out a
good 35 interesting I'm going to read
this out to you if you can't see 5925
compared to 4326 here but then like what
are you going to use this power for what
what game guys which games mobile
computer games have essentially just
become fun benchmarks for your computer
right it's it's it's like a contest that
doesn't
matter % faster when we run a stress
test but the thing that I thought was
even more interesting here is that even
though Oppo is the one that's rocking
the higher power consumption chip that
performance Gap only widened with
prolonged use Because by the end of the
stress test it was actually 50 battery
maybe it's just chips you know
optimization faster than Samsung which
is frankly Bonkers it felt like such a
huge jump that I had to reun the stress
test again to find not quite as large a
gap but still 40% by the end of the test
now there's a pretty decent chance that
you'll never even notice that 30 to 40%
Gap because just scrolling around the
homepages Sam is scrolling on the
homepages 2 I'm going to asse dolls
1,799 something dolls to scroll on the
homepages it's just a portal for
Instagram often the one that can feel a
bit snappier just down to the way that
they've tuned their animations but to me
it does feel like in all the areas where
speed is important like how fast apps
open when you click them and how fast
your camera shutter can capture shots I
am noticing how this camera like the
preview when you're taking your picture
is you know noticeably
bigger how fast your image processing
applies after you've taken those shots
Oppo is generally ahead so what about
the
software I have to say the way that Oppo
handles
multitasking it Remains the gold
standard so let's say for example that
you're on Netflix and then you also want
a browser tab to do a little shopping on
the side bam you can do both in their
optimal aspect ratio is fully open at
but now you decided you know they do
have popup view as well so that is nice
also I guess I can't really test this I
don't have a Netflix app I don't have a
affordable
phone watching is Dragon Ball Z search
on Netflix oh it's not there so let's
pull up our sponsor SAR vpm you just
drag the icon into the mix and all of a
sudden as well but this does look to be
like that OnePlus fold phone uh esque
software
three different apps all open at the
same time and all I need to do now is to
go into Sur shark to change my location
to Japan it's genuinely as simple as
that and now if we pop back to Netflix
it will reload how he got from England
to Japan in 5
seconds and Dragon Ball Z there it is we
can click it we can watch it it
completely opens up the content that you
can get into and it ramps up cuz then
let's say that you decided what it is
that you want to buy over here now
you're left with with the incredibly
fiddly task of adding your details in
except it's not fiddly at all here you
can still get your Communications
forwarded multitasking is sick there's a
few more things as well but you know
Samsung does have their popup view they
do have their Edge screen of course they
do have their split
screen does that just feel clever like
file doc basically just a dump to drop
anything of interest that you're trying
to collect together to put into an email
or share into a WhatsApp group it's
basically just a clipboard but done in a
very intuitive way that actually saves
you time of course you know Samsung can
do that notes you got this whole Oppo o
plus connect thing which to that
credit probably is the easiest way that
I've used on Android to send full
quality files complete with all metadata
to an iPhone with no Wi-Fi connection
seem like something that can be easily
replicated it's probably some random
open source GitHub project that could
probably be turned into an app maybe I
should make one but equally let's be
very honest this is still a long shot
from native Apple inte well I mean this
is the best they can do because Apple's
obviously not going to let people start
name dropping and air dropping stuff uh
on Android phones while also feeling
very much like a knockoff version of
Apple solution and I think just
generally that is one of the things that
I don't like about this software it
feels a little cheap like you go into an
app folder you get recommended shine
again brought to you by team girls of
America if this was a $200 phone fair
enough but not at these kind of prices
sometimes those recommended apps just
fail to load which looks even worse
oppo's app market pings you to get your
attention and even when you eventually
give in and accept it's not a very
intuitive app to be navigating at all
which does make me feel like Samsung
software is more sophisticated and while
this phone doesn't yet have the One ui7
update knowing that it will get it and
just how much I love that software does
make me Veer towards Uncle Sam in this
oh
all finished off by the fact that
Samsung has a definitively better e
ecosystem of surrounding products if
you're outside of China and seven years
of major Android version upgrades Oppo
phones tend to get four it's pretty much
the same story when it comes to AI
features like this Oppo phone is doing
some very interesting stuff like you can
pull up any photo on this phone click
enhance Clarity boom straight up detail
up I mean Samsung also has that
uh it's one of the it's like one of
their AI photo editing applications
Works offline I forgot what it's called
let me see let me get my phone
here
uh but I'll see what it's
called Great and the thing's got this
whole separate app called AI Studio
which is is very cool and very strange
so you get a bunch of free credits when
you buy the phone and then you can spend
those credits doing things like
inserting yourself next to celebrities
it works
kind of although I am curious why I mean
you could probably edit that yourself
offline without having to need some
random Chinese AI credit I don't
obviously trust my AI data with Samsung
South Korean you know us Alli also happy
birthday to Samsung I almost forgot
about them it is their birthday happy
birthday to Samsung and the Apple Scot
Galaxy enhance X so yeah happy birthday
to Samsung everybody great great day you
know they were founded in 1938 and I'm
not going to ask Gemini what 1938 um to
2025 was because um I asked what this is
at 11:00 what happened 18 hours ago or
something like that and it told me no it
was at 9 o'clock 9 o'clock am and I
asked what happened 11 hours ago and it
told me that was 11:
p.m. wait no not 11 hours ago 15 or
something it gave you a wrong answer
okay just just remember that it couldn't
do math okay
um so today is Samsung's
uh 87th birthday so congratulations to
them people using stuff like this to
make it seem like they actually met
those people and if they're not then
what are they doing with it I've managed
to turn myself into a rather handsome if
I might say pirate that's nice but photo
leap can't do that this is powerful AI
hence the credits to stop people
spamming it and it's not just creating
brand new images you can also reimagine
existing images into new Styles and it
is very very effective looks like a
filter okay highest quality image
generation I've seen baked into a phone
interesting though that it's given
drisha an entire new ethnicity an Asian
filter but okay good chance that this is
just down to how the AI has been trained
and aside from that just generally
across the phone let's not forget that
Oppo has a lot of equivalents to
Samsung's AI features like let let's say
you're in a document just like Samsung
there's a whole load of writing tools
oppo's got AI replies for messages
they've got an AI that can write
Instagram captions for you at the same
time I really hope it doesn't come to me
having to use that it's just that on
average oppo's implementation feels
about a year behind a lot of the AI
features are either coming soon or
they're quite situational they work
sometimes and then for some reason not
at other times I mean let's not kid
ourselves I wouldn't exact call
Samsung's AI reliable no no sometimes
you know the typing software can be a
bit sensous it can be a bit glitchy it
can be a bit crashy but you know it is
better it is
better but at the same time if I had to
lean on one of these I would still
rather lean on this and similarly one of
the things Oppo is boasting loudest
about with this phone is link boost this
AI system combined with a 360° antenna
architecture which should improve signal
by how can AI improve your signal it's
not like it's a satellite that pan SS
for it's a satellite in the sky
no 30% in Weak areas but I've tested it
multiple times in multiple locations and
I can't see any I mean how how is AI
supposed to assume your signal I mean I
I can get how I can enhance images how I
can enhance videos text Etc how's it
supposed to vent a signal where there is
n it's like that EV in Odyssey episode
where um Eugene uses his phone from like
2005 to probably flip phone to go into
manual mode
and make a call from a kid radio
what distant tangible benefit over the
Samsung which makes me feel like you
probably won't notice the difference
either okay just before we finish this
off with the cameras I do just want to
mention speak cuz they're important to
me one thing that
you generally notice as Tech gets
thinner is speakers get worse because
they have less space to be able to push
air to create the sound and that's the
case here oppos done a good job I'd say
to make it not suck but it definitely
lacks the satisfying richness
of skinn this is not all should
be now cameras are one area that I was
was exp Oppo to absolutely destroy
Samsung at but when you use this thing
you realize that cameras are one thing
the Oppo has compromised on stupid flash
be nice if they put the flash down put
the H yeah maybe I could play around
with
it this phone specifically to hit their
thinner gos the main camera is decent
but I do think Samsung has more true in
here though I will say this window does
kind of look Overexposed compared to the
window here that's one of the things I
don't like like I like being able to
shoot through a window that's
nice life colors and also it's just a
bit more flattering Oppo has this quite
crunchy contrasty look that I don't
think is for everyone the ultra wide
camera on Oppo is just bad it's an 8
megapixel
camera compared to Samsung's
12 and that is a massive resolution Gap
oppos just doesn't even look Fit For A
2025 phone that said Oppo does have a
better internal selfie camera camer
rather than you know the under display
camera
which is I mean it's not hard I'm pretty
sure my fridge has a better camera than
this thing since Samsung decided to go
for an under display camera that's
capped at four I repeat four
megapixels just like that Mr Beast
contant
like also has better Zoom both have
three times optical zoom but oppo's
three times optical zoom camera is 50
megapixel compared to Samsung's 10
and boy you can tell there is some more
fake AI enhancement going on on Oppo but
even just that as even
144 there more information too also
shout out to Oppo for turning this
telephoto Zoom C camera into the macro
camera too cuz most phones just use
their Ultra wide camera but Oppo has
given this telephoto CA a super short
focusing distance so it fills that role
instead of the ultra wide and this is
the way to my phone mode I I can still
take them but it's no dedicated mode
like a715g which had a trash macro
camera but it was there unth
less aution on your subject when you're
shooting from further away and it also
means that you can just get closer
without physically needing to get closer
which is less fiddly and you're blocking
less of the light on that subject this
Samsung doesn't even have a proper macro
mode that said nothing beats Samsung's
portrait mode and its ability to detect
depth can you see how Oppo has decid
kind looks better but uh I'm not
sure blur this entire Booth as if it's
really far away from oh I guess you
didn't want it but
okay except for those two
stickers interesting choice OPP so
cameras are about a draw the camera app
on the Oppo is smoother which is a nice
plus thought going give the Samsung
better aut wide by main camera zoom uh
goes to opo which then goes to the macro
okay it's not a consistently better
camera than Sammy and so that leaves us
with a score 6.5 points to 3.5 and the
numbers aren't everything but would I
pick the Oppo if I had a choice Oppo W
that I I accidentally clicked the tab so
there's that um that's all what we have
for</pre>
