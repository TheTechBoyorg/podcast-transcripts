<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 11825</h1>
<pre>everybody and welcome to to this weekend
The Tech booy podcast we have so much to
talk about today but first and most
important is the impeding Tik Tock ban
and I have to say it I have to say I
called it back in 2023 that I called it
that in an article headline for American
Daily Press I went V viral for hating
Tik Tok but I do not want it banned I
had to unfortunately defend Tik Tok
because of the problem that we see that
is in front of us right now where I said
in this article back in 2023 that if Tik
Tok got banned that if Tik Tok got
banned then a mware ridden virus
infected application would rise up and
would infest the hearts and minds of
Young Americans and as well as steal
their data and what we see here now and
today is that exact same thing with this
new application called red note which is
a Chinese spyware application plus it
has an even more powerful virus than the
one that I thought it was going to be um
replacing Chinese red note is obviously
mare it's spyware and it's in Chinese
but it's also infecting the hearts and
minds of Young Americans with Communism
essentially so here are the top three
applications in the Google Play Store
right now it's readed note the Chinese
Communist um essentially the Communist
Manu Manifesto Marxist application then
we have lemon 8 which is also made by
the same people who make Tik Tok um I
think lemon 8 is supposed to stand
lemonade Clapper I don't know what that
is then Tik Tok and timu so the top five
applications in the Play Store the four
out of five of them are all made by the
Chinese Communist party and or or have
close ties and links to them legally by
definition they have to have close ties
and links to the CCP and this is this is
evil but the first thing that we have to
talk about is red note so there are
influencers on the internet who are
going around American influencers who
have obviously been um either paid or
just infected by communism which
obviously communism only looks good in a
capitalist system uh communism only
looks good when you have people that
have money like they're recording these
off of their thousand iPhones they're
recording these off of you know using
tons of beauty products
um let me see if I can get my yeah might
find my bookmarks with these tons of of
beauty products and bookmarks and of
course the Chinese government has huge
control over what um is shed on internet
in China with of course the great
firewall so you see this propaganda that
is being propagated throughout the net
networks and then you have these
gullible 20 old teenagers who have all
been infected by Tik Tok and you know
they come in they they've been on Tik
Tok for maybe six years five years it
it's about to get banned in fact CNN
finally has a timer showing it's death
dat it's a little over 12 hours right
now if I remember correctly anyway they
find all these people they've been on
Tik Tok for five or six years they think
they really need it and then light
switch they come on and they switch them
over to this even more communist
application it's in manderin Chinese for
crying out loud and they are all getting
infected by what's happening here yes
it's at 11 hours right now 53 minutes in
uh 51 seconds so this is the timer that
CNN is showing of the Tik tock um sell
or die ban and this th this is
ridiculous okay so yes in principle I
like uh Tik Tok to be banned but Tik Tok
is not nearly as dangerous as this um
Chinese Communist um application here
this the Tik Tok ban here and we're
going to get into what this application
does so apart from the mass tracking
that it has oh we already have a chat
wow um hello
David what oh that's uh that's my head
fire uh head headphone anyway
uh right with this application red note
which is infecting the hearts and minds
of Young Americans and I guess uh maybe
people over in uh India as well but I'm
not sure India is barely capitalist
anyway so it's not like they kind of
count anyway here is a video of some
appears to be 20-year-old influencer
girl right now not going to insult all
the 20-year-old influencer girls but I'm
not going to like not the smartest tools
in the shed here okay so uh anyway here
here's the video of the 20-year-old
influencer girl and let's turn to the
very important and wise things that she
has to say for the rest of us that's
just not the case let's go for my
Chinese friend I just this is obviously
posted to red note because she has moved
over to it I mean she has caps it's in
Mandarin Chinese I mean did you ever
think we live to see today where
millions and millions of potential
teenagers are going to try to switch
over from you know capist light kind of
O Tik Tok to um essentially communist
Mandarin Chinese um red note and it's
shot up within like three
days I just want to tell you some
discussions Americans are having right
now all of us agree and are astounded at
how cheap and affordable your groceries
how yeah um obviously the people who are
showing their groceries on red note on
from the Chinese side of the application
let's see what they have here uh well
see that that's an opinion and of course
you don't uh hear at the techboy media
uh say that so yep that that is an
opinion anyway uh and again this is this
is again proving how RZ and and dating
and all of these type of things can be
used as a weapon it is it is Chinese
National weapon in fact in 2022 over in
SS ltw I said that it is was the nuclear
power of the 21st century and I mean
look at this well look it's 2025 now and
China is actually using it as a nuclear
power to try to promote communism to the
United States of America I mean this is
absolutely ridiculous and I I I called
it two years ago and everyone's sitting
around here acting like I was crazy but
no no look they're using Wiz and and and
all of these things to I mean look we we
have people in the chat saying things
like this and if people think that and
in fact we can put her in the scanner
it's not like she face isn't already in
the scanner because she's uploaded her
face voluntarily to a Chinese Communist
spy app so yeah you know let's put it in
the scanner and let's see what the let's
see what the rank says okay I mean at
least we're going to an American spy app
which again I've said multiple times I'd
rather my dad be in five ey companies
five ey countries rather in American
companies than in than in China it's
totally different anyway let's get to it
affordable groceries this is ridiculous
the people who are posting the groceries
are it's propaganda it's communism you
want to see affordable groceries you
have to do what the what they did when
they come over here uh when the when the
Russians came over here in like 1989
1990 and they walked in and they saw the
grocery store that wasn't propaganda he
just walked into a grocery store and he
was astounded he was shocked these
people we we we live in 2025 the land of
AI okay you can't oh wow guys look a
Banana's going for a penny over in
China these people are so Gable anyway
housing and cars are I have been
watching you guys's grocery hul videos
and grocery haul videos this woman
actually believes grocery haul videos do
you think people actually believe those
haul videos here in the United States of
America like maybe she does maybe she's
been bought and paid for or maybe she's
just genuinely an idiot I don't know but
do you think that the majority of the
country believes that groceries are
cheaper in China than in the United
States of America or that cars are
cheaper in China than United States of
America and even hypothetically if they
are if they are is it worth it to go to
a communist Marxist totalitarian state
like China for it I say no and it is
blowing my mind there wasn't much to
blow okay your mind probably wasn't that
big I'm so sorry but if you're on red
note up here um simping for Chinese uh
communist China that that's ridiculous
Google is obviously not more dangerous
right Google is based in America they
have to abide by us laws right for all
the bad that Google's allegedly done
right I mean at least not throwing
people into prison camps okay I'm I'm on
team Google
here anyway this America could never a
lot of us also canot America could never
America could never
okay I'm I'm America is the greatest
country in the world okay look the only
reason she's allowed she's she's able to
say this in like 4K sitting there with
no job um yapping there with her white
blonde hair is because of America you
think that in
China other than the select few
propagandists that people are sitting
around there with white blonde hair
yapping into a thousand um iPhone do do
you really think that girl
believe how advanced your country is I
cannot
believe utterly
ridiculous I mean this woman I mean I I
should find her and try to sell her
something hey hi this this rulu is
actually um an invisible Wu and it it
can float and it and it can
fly anyway all right she's going into
the scanner right I mean the face is
already in a database because we were
always shown and told that you guys were
and in the scanner it's at 9.1 so we
have there we go super weapon Riz R
super weapon call it back in 2023 you
guys can go read it on L2 de you world
like starving country that's just not
the case the fact that
95% of you she she she thinks that this
is so smart wow food in the United
States uh is cheap food in China better
obviously yes there's nothing to blow
who mind there's nothing to do as spike
said to um Cindy I believe in Kids
Corner episode Cindy says um they they
were insulting my intelligence and then
Spike with twitch back there's nothing
to insult again there's nothing to
insult there's nothing to blow her mind
cannot be blown you cannot blow uh
something that's invisible
okay you guys own homes is 95% of the
Chinese own
homes what
women do you realize how stupid that
sounds even though hey 95% of the
Chinese are all adults because I
guarantee you there not like you know
all these Chinese children running
around you know and Chinese children
would make up oh I don't know half a
third of the population I'm not sure who
so and I'm just coming up I haven't even
watched this video and here I am
processing an eliminating her claims at
real time in real speed processing
information quickly because
I have not been infected by Tik Tok I
have not been infected by red note
mindboggling boggling she says
boggling again there's nothing to blow
there's nothing to Boggle I mean she's
probably oh wow you can tie your
shoes like seriously almost impossible
to own a home anywhere in the US you
have to work immensely hard how about
y'all's law school I'm sure yeah she
sits there we have to
work immensely hard you know it takes so
much work to translate these into
Chinese and you have to sit
there edit and
um
smile I mean you know people on the
internet like oh girls live life on easy
mode and they'll snap back no no no
girls don't live lives on easy mode okay
fine fine fine look most women probably
don't live life on easy mode or whatever
but I can tell you that these online
Internet influencers they certainly are
living a life on easy
mode is like $800 a year and I think
that your homeless rate is like $800 a
year for law school well you know again
that's right red not it's so dangerous
it's is infecting Chinese Communist
propaganda into the hearts and minds of
vulnerable children right and there was
this bill that's trying to get passed by
some C maybe representative I don't
remember we was talking about oh we
should lower the voting age to 16 and
you know what I have to say to that
absolutely heck no never I'd rathered
the voting a to be raised to 21 yeah
that would affect me because that means
I couldn't vote until another three
years but whatever it's not like we're
gonna have another president until four
years so I missed this one by like five
days um absolutely not in November 9th
2022
right you know what happened on that day
somehow on November 9th 20122 I'm over
here running for pres of a high school
I'm 15 about to turn
16 right I had 15y old 16y old 17y old
all trying to vote for
me you know not counting the stolen
elects and stuff that we've talked about
but they somehow turn this election that
from like major just issues of policy
like a normal election into an election
talking about abortion and uh lgbtq y y
y blah blah blah right if 16y olds are
dumb enough to not vote for me right I'm
not talking about the one over in glory
but this is the one over in Energizer
from the ssw Ser so this is one in
public school if if public students are
dumb enough not to vote for me because
of my STS on things that I cannot change
right I'm not running for government of
Texas for crying out loud I'm running
for just president of the school and if
the next year I wasn't at the school but
I heard the story about Waffle gate when
they commit federal crimes to get um
federal crimes not me but other people
commit federal crimes running heating
applications and running some type of
scam election right if you have this
much synan against in in in in high
school geopolitics right do you really
think I 16year olds who who aren't even
smart enough I'm sorry to vote for me
right other than the high school Alexa
stolen syan right who Tred to make this
into some type of huge political issue
here right he tried to turn this
election into something about Evolution
and abortion and lgbtq blah blah blah
blah that of course it loses to me a few
votes you think I want them voting for
who the president of the United States
the most powerful country and the
greatest country in the world is no
right because if we have these 16year
old who over here running their mouths
and yapping on red note I don't know
maybe 20 what's the app say the face
scan says that she looks 18 okay maybe
that's your IQ score too anyway if you
have these people running around and
yapping voting for the president of the
United States and over here voting on
yapping about vetner right because the
popular social media application there
was actually B so in 2022 my campaign
slogan was B real vote for me right in
2026 we're gonna have kids running
around on red note trying to get the
students to vote for them and maybe who
knows China will just hack it into the
election systems of millions of uh high
school student council elections and
sway of votes for whoever was the
dumbest student right 95% yeah
absolutely absolutely right and
obviously red note is Chinese propaganda
and we said ban it ban it immediately we
said ban lemon just ban bite dance from
the country right just ban it right you
know I was against it now I I was
against Banning Tik Tok because of
what's happened but it's already
happened so just we reset the
obligation
18% I have people living outside of
tents outside of my building like it's
well maybe I don't know with the money
that you are obviously making from this
with those huge eyes and white white as
hair right just go For the Love of All
that's good go be a makeup model and
then donate the money instead of sing
for the Chinese Communist
party it's terrible here what I saw it's
terrible say earlier that a cancer
medication that they get is about $20
China
and I I I what
I do you she's a really good actor and
she's bought and paid for or B she has
the IQ sales of a dead squirrel and in
fact I do not say this lightly I do not
say this likely I despise this woman
with every fiber in my being but
honestly Jasmine Crockett is smarter
than her and um that scares me we have
people like her who make jasmine
Crockett who
has like one brain cell okay she tried
to
compare Investments to Dei okay if if we
have people who make her look like I
don't know a a Harvard Professor we are
so screwed we are so
screwed and Tik tok's about to get
banned in like 12 hours unless someone
buys it so tomorrow yeah white girl pack
is about to um start crying like that
tomorrow screaming it's going to be
terrible terrible tomorrow in church you
know for all the people who have to I
guess use Instagram then um yeah it's
gonna be over um anyway I I'm sorry how
is this person
incompetent like I I please never run
for political please run for presid R
president I will run against you and I
will destroy you and they are paying
22,000
a month in yeah that's because our
cancer treatments in the United States a
work and B exist cancer treatment in
China does not cost $20
you TW does anyone seriously think that
cancer treatment cost $20 in
China in the US for that same
medication what a lot of you guys were
also thinking that it's propaganda that
our kids sometimes if they can afford it
and their parents want to we'll put them
in a bulletproof like backpack to go to
school they
all yeah you do realize that in China
you know if they don't like what you say
you go into a camp and you get killed
that way okay and no backpack is going
to help you
there there is plenty of proof that it's
a Chinese small um the proof is that Tik
Tok is about to get banned so then they
redirect them to this other application
red note which is essentially a scly
version The Communist
Manifesto too many dollars
for they also do stand up and do the
Pledge of Allegiance every single day
yes we pledge to the flag of our great
country um you know in China they have
made military parade and they fly the
thing and parade nukes around and stuff
like that and if you know you don't like
the leader and you're kind of executed
and your president is elected for like
90 something per of the vote because
he's the only candidate on the list but
yes we can pledge to the flag and have
close
elections how terrible I I am so I'm so
sorry this woman has to pledge to the
flag of the country that's you know
keeping her safe from our greatest rival
China day before class starts this whole
experience might just be the most awake
and United I think I've ever seen this
country
woman shut up okay sit down shut up and
be an Instagram model okay I I I kind of
liked it back then when all the people
when when when they sit there they sit
there the people you know that ranked up
9.1 that sit there and say you know
stupid stuff but not they kind of like
keep their mouth shut and not respond to
comments and you know take pictures on
Instagram and just like oh I'm just a
girl oh I'm just flowing my hair oh
which girl I'm after yeah be stupid in
your corner there but please do not
mouth off about Chinese Communist
propaganda okay please it it would be
better if you just sat there was like oh
oh wow I'm just a girl you know I I
can't do
math okay look I'm a big proponent of
the 19th Amendment but um can we exempt
her please please exempt her hey we can
we can send her to her Beloved Country
let's let's start a goof find me people
let's send uh kle Kipper to um her
Beloved Country of uh
China yeah I I don't she's 20 so that
means she was probably born in
2005 all right so um in 2004 you know
she probably doesn't know what happened
in in 2003 she doesn't know what
happened in 2001 she doesn't know what
happened in 2002 she don't know what
happened in yeah yeah okay um anyway we
are pissed at our government number one
number two and you do know that if
you're upset with the government in in
in America you can go outside have a
protest and nothing will happen to you
in um China you go outside and have a
protest and um we won't be hearing from
you anymore
okay astounded astounded absolutely you
know she she's really breaking out the
big words the thesaurus you know she
went into a Google she went to a
dictionary application on her iPhone she
was like I need biger wi like in a pure
smart right and don't don't let those
eyes and the hair in the face capture
you and I just Yap you into um uh
communism and we're gonna starve and
Googs
no okay this is this is a major threat
that faces the United States of America
we should ban red we should ban red note
we should ban and we should ban um all
this propaganda that's coming into the
United States of America right you want
to spray Chinese propaganda right well
you would spread Chinese propaganda on
an American Outlet like Instagram or X
or YouTube okay that's that's your right
that's your legal prerogative but we
don't have to let foreign countries come
in and basically control what's what's
going on um in uh in in our country
right we are the greatest country in the
world and the only reason you're allowed
to do this because we live in America
right you don't see any American
propaganda um coming out of China now
what we are seeing and I do like this is
that you know because we're just better
you know each and every one of our
citizens no
matter how hard they try to hide at no
matter how deep it's in within them
right no matter how low their IQ
is is all proud to be an American they
all love this great great country and
sometimes those American values Free
Speech patriotism sometimes comes
resurgent
uh resurgent here so apparently American
woman or maybe Spanish but this is also
a uh another thing here according to
community not to Spanish but you know I
think this is also happening to American
women as well uh with American women as
well like these these values here that
are seeping into the application on red
note which I don't understand why she'd
be Spanish anyway because Tik Tok is
still alive and well in Spain right so
we see this woman here right apparently
she is
attracting uh Chinese people so there's
like a a western version of red note and
there's a Chinese version of red node
and they're kind of like merging
together and she's attracting the
Chinese citizens to like her instead of
the Chinese woman right and also some
other American values are trying to get
through Free Speech some things that
they can't like talk about
and you know some of those values are
trying to get banned and China is trying
to like Snap down on the American
version of R note so they want to export
their junk to us but they don't want us
to be exporting our culture to them
right and this is kind of hilarious like
apparently there's this thing in like
books and movies of television shows
called like the girl next door it's on
Urban Dictionary or something right
whereas like some random girl next door
that you have a crush on or whatever um
well apparently this is like the girl
next country the girl next continent
okay so just just little tiny bit of
americanism patriotism that is seeping
through even with the idiots like this
woman and um her friends and her
compatriots more like comrades right
even even if
this they just have a little a little
bit too much of americanism that's
seeking seeping through that seeping
through to the Chinese version of Tik
Tock and hopefully maybe maybe that our
American Excellence or American
patriotism overpowering right even with
these idiots that are standing in the
way we'll seep through Chinese Communist
red note and will'll indoctrinate them
all for capitalism and freedom of
religion and good patriotic American
values and you know hopefully this this
works and you know this this will be a
fiercely patriotic stream today as we um
wait for the impending scream of every
white golden America uh at 12 a at 12:
p.m. midnight of course we will be
celebrating something a lot more
important at 12 pm midnight because the
Tex Houston Texans I'm making this
prediction before the game Houston
Texans will destroy the Kansas City
Chiefs um in the playoffs today I am
declaring it right
now
um so yeah so hopefully the
Texans win and they will win obviously
all right um so yep Tik Tok has caused
all of this communist R to infest
America do not download this
application though some annoying people
have gotten banned off that application
so this is kind of funny it's kind of
funny all right here's next on our
agenda we have to talk about people who
are on Tik Tok uh back when Tik Tok was
uh you know existent so here we go
tuning to SSA the classified SSA ltw and
we have finally released the great Chase
a week before the chase actually
happened I believe this Chase happened
on the 24th or the 23rd of January 2024
so you know this is historic and we will
be releasing the official documents of
course the names changed or and are
reacted school name changed obviously
the glory Christian from which original
name um the original documents that
detailed my Chase Ethan Chase Chase with
Damian our newest school bully right so
he's kind of taking the place of Molly
Marly will come back though because I
and we are GNA kind of I'm fast
forwarding here now but um in the story
I will run a sting operation against
some people and Marley is included in it
um I ran a s operation against these P
kids who are under a bridge skipping
school under a bridge maybe maybe not
offering demonic uh sacrifices so that
that was cool back over in April so um
we we have that to look forward to but
you know gcam is crumbling here and they
have to extract SSA from his hiding
place in the woods here um so hope you
guys can check this out but it's also
tied into the rise of summer because
Damian has a crush on summer and um you
know fortunately here didn't cause
geopolitical tension in Nightmare here
but guys make sure you go check out the
great Chase and make sure you also go
check out our new domain site. tech.org
site. tech boy.org
site. tech boy.org make sure you check
that out everybody um that will be a
link of every website that we have here
so that include the adventures and
odyssey ssw the tech boy.org of course X
Twitter Snapchat X Snapchat Instagram
all all of those things so make sure you
check that out all right speaking of
adventures and odyssey the we podcast is
apparently mad at adventures and odyssey
and they're not mad about adventures and
odyssey but the absolute faly that they
committed by having their thousandth
episode thousandth episode and not
having Mr Whitaker in it or Connie in it
this album only has two adults in it and
that would be um well is Rene an adult
she's like 20 so I guess technically she
comes an adult but like the main cast of
the golds would be Katrina and Mr whu Mr
whu in the thousandth episode album it's
only in one episode the last episode
actually and also this is the first
episode uh album Sorry that
has uh the same amount of episodes away
from Odyssey in Baltimore um than in
Odyssey which would be the other three
episodes which would include
Emily's episode which was kind of weird
and then Mr Whitaker and Rene's episode
as well but it was a more kid-centric
more kid focused series and you know I
thought okay that's nice I like hearing
from some of the kids are own Odyssey
and not Odyssey we like to hear what
they have to say of course the we
podcast can't well enough be in the M of
in for promoting unbiblical ideas they
not but also they had these women come
on I think it was a a year ago and
they're yapping about
how um event Odyssey is now more like a
and I kid you not they said Disney
Channel show and it's more drama and
it's more exciting than you know
teaching or something like that and Mr
Whit is crazy and they're not deferring
to the parents and they want to see more
families and they want the service to be
kind of like less exciting and to that I
say absolutely freaking not okay look we
have a thousand episodes we need to have
more exciting episodes more exciting
episodes more exciting episodes okay um
you know we want to have memorable
episodes which episodes do you remember
and also she's like well we want to
return back to biblical vals and
biblical lessons first of all he you
want if you want to have that we have
that from 80s 90s 2000s and everything
like that right we have all these
lessons that you can go back and teach
your children if you want to listen to
that and now new Odyssey they're still
teaching these lessons but they now have
influx of new characters right and the
problem is if you have all these
families like multiple families instead
of just multiple kids you can't focus on
one single aspect of their life right
and for the record she's talking about
oh Mr Whitaker is not talking about all
parents or anything like this first of
all we hear from Mr Jones Emily's father
in the r Saga a lot Mr Whitaker is a
deao parent of the
uh uh Vel of the Vel Kids In America
their parents are in Japan he's an
ambassador in Japan okay so
um what what what do you want him to do
call in every night or something like
that I've assume they're doing I assume
they're doing that but like you can't
have those episodes all the time besides
you say you want more P into involvement
well guys guess what better Buck better
Buck next time you have conversations
with Katrina melner and buck Oliver who
is his legal
guardian just it's just it's incessant
okay it's crazy and it's it's the kind
of thing that's like oh maybe we
shouldn't be banning things for kids
because how are they supposed to learn
things if you have parents who out here
saying that they think that event
Odyssey is bad for their kids like oh
they also said that and I kid you not
the very
very
tame romance between uh Jules and buck
they called that adult okay these these
people that were getting interviewed so
obviously I I don't know what's going on
here but it it's
ridiculous it's it's
ridiculous ridiculous okay just for the
love all it's good like maybe she's
saying kids as in like six-year-olds
which is fine
whatever
but here here is here is what they said
eval is not catering to homeschool
families and the romance is for adults
we're so screwed it's over it it is so
over okay advention Odyssey is not
catering to homeschool families because
homeschool families might be the
demographic of Odyssey but what what
would you like right I was a homeschool
kid we can talk more about homeschooling
later in the podcast
but like don't you want to hear how the
have side has it too and also lots of
public schoolers and private schoolers
listen to event odyy as well okay and
they did have a homeschool family and
they did player for jokes and it was
funny okay so get lives please for of
all that's good advention Odyssey is the
best audio drama in the history of of
the country like if you lock down from
I'm so sorry it's over it's
over all right now speaking of another
Audio Drama and this does tie into Tech
so don't don't get don't get
mad and we're going to play a little bit
bit of it um from reframe media um it's
called Kids Corner Kids Corner
ha attack and this has to do Tech
because we're going to go to do this
episode and dissect the hacking scenes
in the episode right and I have to say I
have no idea what they're doing I I
don't know when this came out I think
it's like 2012-ish so maybe you know
Wi-Fi isn't as secured back then but I
still have no idea what they're doing so
let's let's dissect the hacking in Kids
Corner hack attack um presented by
reframe media um commenters tell me if
you guys can still hear this
on today's Kids Corner today enter by
the side window side window access every
device that here now yeah on today's kid
Corner today's that website sometimes
glitches out so I'm GNA actually go to
the download page here go to the find
MP3 and we're going to first back into
like five minutes here and just in case
you can't hear it here's some context uh
Keenan hacks somehow into the printers
VI Wi-Fi and put name on it where the
names should be like of the restaurant
all right and that's how he gets to Liz
and Cole who's like texting Cowboy to
come
over 20 what 25th what uh anyways the
receipt yes that well I simply
repurposed the space reserved to the
pretzel palace's brand message by
inserting my own message it works and
it's I'm wondering how he did that
because like what how does he have their
software or know what software that they
are using right
um that that's my first question like I
I've done PR hacking before so maybe
that's possible but he'd have to do it
really really quickly he'd have to know
which receipt it's on and he's like in
sixth grade so uh maybe worked obviously
because you two are here now well yeah
but I I mean how the TR mall is gracious
enough to supply free Wi-Fi internet
access and that's good but why is the
mall system a
on the same Wi-Fi as everyone else also
nowadays when you scan Wi-Fi it you
don't really see anything that comes up
like I scanned networks before I didn't
really see much that came up um also
still you still have to be able to
access that pter um get a vulnerability
the printer thing is actually the most
feasible thing that happens in this
episode
honestly every device that connects here
becomes an ipsofacto node on set
ipsofacto node doesn't exist okay I
looked it up there's no such thing as an
IPO Factor node he's just yapping
Network some it's like a house where
everyone who logs in comes in through
the front door except for me I prefer to
enter by the side window side window ah
don't get that I mean listen let's talk
about Nets and not works and IPO fso
side winders you know whatever it is
starting to make my head hurt if y'all
excuse me I'm going to get out of here
and get home and take my doughy glop
with me I'll catch you later Spike yeah
sure bye Cole oh and thanks for lunch
yeah buddy don't mention it
yeah okay Kean what's this thing about
side windows right well everyone in
their sister logs on to the Wi-Fi here
again I don't understand why the Wi-Fi
for the customers is the same as the
Wi-Fi for the employees that's just
ridiculous even in
2012 by opening a web browser and using
the standard UI UI a user interface uh
so what well so I take a slightly
different route I go into the
programming code behind the U
and then I poke around until I find an
which again doesn't make sense all it
sounds like is he's doing is he goes
onto the uh web portal and just kind of
like does this oh inspect because that's
what he means by go behind the UI you go
inspect you can kind of edit code in
here but that's Billy hacking like I
mean sure you can change grade on there
but it's not changing it silver side you
just kind of change it so you can I
guess trick your parents to think you
have all A's and but you actually have
FS alternate entry point then [ __ ] I'm in
the network with access to every device
that's logged in wow no I don't know how
this works I've tried this for years you
know how hard it is to hack a device
that you know the Wi-Fi password too I
want this network here I can't just open
up command promp and have access to
every device on here right I can open up
thing or some Network scanning
application on my phone scan the network
and see what ports open and that's it
okay that's it you don't have access to
set device right unless they have
um and unless you have like the the
ports and their passwords and you know
you think people on their phones are
just leaving random ports open no look
here here's the pretzel Palace node and
here's where the messages on the
receipts are stored wow so what's that
other stuff on your screen why are they
saving the printer receipts on a
server like just I mean maybe I mean the
printer thing is the most accurate well
realistic thing the next thing it just
gets crazy said I can can see every
device that's logged into the network
here look at this this person is
chatting with someone it seems they're
having a bit of an argument whoa I'll
say they are hey this maybe but even in
2012 they already have been encrypted
let's see what Instagram
uh what would the what were the DM
applications in 2012 all right was
Snapchat when was snap that
encrypted so maybe but it's it's very
unlikely okay I've tried this stuff
before it's really really hard and it's
not as easy or GUI Centric as it makes
it seem this one just posted a selfie
with some stuff he bought yep oh now
what oh this one is checking her bank
account bad idea on a public network
yeah well somebody could just come along
and pick up her account number and and
that's the that's the thing I don't like
when they say oh someone can just come
along and pick up your account number
blah blah blah right and I know this is
a audio drama but I'm talking about in
the wi hacker space like if you say why
your public Network's bad you're getting
you will get searching into Google right
now you will get something like this
from uh antivirus or maybe some type of
AD but you don't really find out how
they like hackers can use this hackers
can do this but don't really teach you
how how am I supposed to
learn password then [ __ ] her money's gone
which in her case isn't much all right
so that's that's hacking scene one now
let's get tock hacking scene to that
start to hack into the school um from
the school's Network itself let's see if
I can oh thank you I'm here all week oh
here we
go oh let's go the Third Kind gray oh
let me fast forward I think it's like at
the 10
minute so how's this flash drive of oh
yeah yeah okay so what they're trying to
do is is they're going to try to do some
editing on schools network with this
flash drive
from a public computer in the school
library yeah it has a little bit of code
that will create a handshake with
practically any network it's connected
to we just need an entry point un like
the network connections they have in the
school
library what so what do you say B sounds
unanimous meet me in the school library
at
lunchtime all right so may if you plug
into like e that on telephone jacks or
he's plugging into a computer I don't
know what he's plugging into but the
only thing I Noti that you can plug into
an ether neck Jack is things that can
intercept traffic not edit
[Music]
traffic hey Liz we're over here sh quiet
in the library sorry over here Liz sh I
am
shushing hi Liz do you have the flash
drive you always have that Trope in
librar Li look nobody gets hurt right
all for a good laugh and everyone will
think we're awesome oh everyone want to
be our friends excellent and here we
go okay just have to jump over he typing
something I what are you doing a little
of this and reroute a little of that and
we're in [ __ ] sorry pammo in what some
sofa or
something now what well let's take a
little tour of the
system I I think he's maybe like the
windowss C drive Network shared F to
thing
H lookie here what what is that oh it's
the school's Bell System what are all
those numbers
hey how how did he do
that those are the times and durations
of all the days Bells like why would it
be connected to the internet and if not
then that mean she basically remoted
into a computer open up the school bell
system software which it's just do you
know how hard it is to remote into a
computer from a network and you don't
know the password just reroute traffic
can those be changed easy peasy can I do
some adjusting we'll have at it well
this should make things more interesting
this afternoon what are you doing Liz oh
just making some minor adjustments to
the bell schedule and timing hey hey
what's that well it appears to be the
announcements that are going to why are
the announcements thr on the server just
put them on the laptop okay be read by
school you know they're not putting
announcements on servers or anything
like that just they type it up in know
email them to people
okay let's just do a little script
editing shall we all yours and also
again he is remotely editing a script on
a computer from some Network terminal
back in the school
library yeah know yeah know is where my
standup comedy experience comes all
right so you know since we set you guys
up let's have let's have a payoff for
you let's give you the
payoff in class now what going
[Music]
on where did he get these but fine it is
a better Bell in my
opinion oh my god oh hey Bill what are
you going to play for long for
yeah may I have your attention please
students and staff may I have your
attention it seems that our school's
Bell sister has had some sort of
malfunction sounds like it's functioning
just fine to me please report to your
last class immediately I repeat please
report to class immediately thank you
thank
[Music]
you that was
awesome here comes the script and I mean
honestly because of what happened to the
Chinese no Kami thing I mean the script
might be potent Miss
CH yeah yeah just wait for Miss wd's
announcements well hopefully you took
the boredom out of them oh I
did attention students we have contacted
a vendor to service our Val system I can
assure you that it shall return to its
normal functions as all you did was
change the settings fix it yourself
woman and since our class time was cut
short due to the Val malfunction I will
go right into the
announcements the cheerleaders will hold
their spring bake sale fundraiser
tomorrow morning please make your
selection from various undercooked and
possibly burnt bakos in support of a
silly Squad of giggly
girls is he wrong is he
wrong thank you I'm here all week wait
where did that come from again
how how does she not have this on Dee
thinking and we we have to talk about on
Dee thinking soon congratulations are in
order for the reparum Middle School
chess team which won their first match
of the Season yesterday after several
losses this goes to prove the adage that
even a blind squirrel will occasionally
find a KN she's reading it as she goes
like come up with something else okay
like
our final announcement thank goodness
thank goodness we are pleased to
announce that a reptarium middle school
student has won the title of champion
hog caller let's all congratulate cooh
for his Superior swine summoning
abilities all right so that's what
happens and um I'm going to zoom in here
now this this is the most unrealistic
hacking scene watch his satellite TV
with 5,000 channels I wish we could do
something about that seriously hold on a
minute we can wait what wait hold up
what are you doing kadden I'm pulling
out my laptop well yes I can see that
but what are you doing what is Cole's
address and again for some reason in
this town this is like it's application
you can just track anyone's phone like
right there in the app store by phone
number is that's all they know his
address they uh milro 432 milro street
right yeah yeah you what what are you
doing showing Cole that he can't be mean
to my new best friends
czy one thing to this kid just pulls out
a laptop and somehow hacks into a
satellite again federal offense like
that's totally illegal and b a b also it
totally impossible so we couldn't have
done this so um kids going to get better
hacking scenes is what I have to tell
you about that now speaking of thinking
on your feet there was this discourse
about how
homeschool uh kids are like weird and
and people are like oh know homeschool
kids aren't weird
um yes yeah yeah they are okay um as as
as a homeschool kid
uh uh you know I I watch weird okay but
this does lead to uh firster St great
this lead to student situations I'm
trying to see if I can find
it what name let's see if I can find a
message oh wow bunch of scammers in my
inbox oh here she
[Music]
is all right let's see if I can find it
I'm doing some searching
here oh don't miss
spell oh here you go
I'm trying to
find I'm trying to find it
ah here it
is here's a quote for me so you know
it's profound I don't know do do dot I
feel like I'm two years ahead in terms
of intelligence and two years behind
soci caus problems from
meing something and not completely
mesing with kids who um see see I can
actually read on the Fly and edit okay
unlike Miss wad
uh not complete messing with kids who
started making fart noises for two
months thank you sumu
it spod interesting debates because I
could read respond quickly to stuff but
be innocent and Confused people was kind
of hard to explain let's talk about this
um this um number one this this thing SP
people like be in a and Confused people
was kind of hard to explain right well
you know obviously branding 11 and 12th
grade Chris boy branding right gcp right
that was The Branding everything I've
have done it's you know it's based on
real reality but it's also scripted it's
it's it's it's branding here because you
know because I was homeo right and this
is how I can attest that homeschool kids
are with because I was homeschool right
I did not have exposure to like media
the other kids you know had exposure to
therefore they sometimes try to bait me
into ridiculous questions now not to
brag this is mostly for a public school
thing but I was smarter than those kids
right some of those kids not all of them
some of those kids right I mean we see
have people over here running waffle
gate okay I am smarter than the people
who ran waffle gate anyway these people
try to run trap questions not just about
Evolution but
about things of this nature like even in
the SS ltw book series not book well
even in the book series but especially
the web series um like I I put it in
that kids were trying to trap me on
questions about like race or something
like that now if they come over here and
try to tra ask me trap questions about
something I'm an expert on like that or
Samsung or anything like that well I
mean the headline should be a kid own
facts and logic about
Tech B fact kids with facts and logic
about Samsung right speaking of events
coming up on Wednesday really excited
for them right it's over them but they
try to go over here and try to bait me
into having some type of inappropriate
discussion with them either a PR what
they don't know I don't know what
they're talking about with 75% 90% of
the time I do not know what they're
talking about right so the ACT it's
based on real real thing like and and
most of the time you know because my
mind would be working fast like walking
quickly on my feet right I could use
that to out Tobit them but you have to
bait them in to
discussions right so if they try to bait
you into discussion right you just sit
there and you you don't take the bait
right you don't answer the stupid
questions like do you like this is some
stupid accusation do you like white
girls better than black girls nothing
like that don't don't sit there and take
those stupid accusations and try to try
try to out argue them right if
especially if they're talking about
something inappropriate don't sit there
and take those accusations and then try
to out argue them right it's not GNA
work there make them try to explain it
to you right and then use alternative
meanings of the woods because it's
different alternative meanings of the
woods right unlike that stupid girl with
the blonde white hair right I actually
probably didn't have to use a sist to
look up three cable words like so I can
come up here and out debate them and of
course if IED out debate you on
something like socially like race or
something like that for some reason like
they try to trap me in questions about
that oh do you value being
black so again a I'd have a whole bunch
of pre responded questions and B uh
responses pre pre like PR responses n b
i could easily out debate them be like
bro it's it's not a value okay I'm I'm
not over here like it's not a value I
don't hate it I don't know like it it's
not a value you idiots right but you
kind of like out the vate them there and
also again be uncan okay like I could
say stuff but i' say things in such a
way like I I got away with so much
especially in public school they they
say stuff in such a way that they cannot
pin anything on you like they try
to pin
B me for being a whole bunch of ick and
against things I just would like easily
site things and then kind of like spin
out of things it's just right
homeschooling made it so that I didn't
understand what they're talking about
but was still able to out debate them
and out argue them because of I guess
how my mind works so there's there's
that little ramble for today I mean I I
was good at yapping right I mean again I
am good at yapping they're not I mean I
am good at
yapping hence this podcast I mean they
don't have any podcast that I know of um
and they'd be welcome to come on here
and try to you know out debate me but I
I don't think it work
anyway
um on to the next topic and it's this
topic that I feel passionately about is
that
this this
um kids how how is that even a topic
whatever I'm just gonna cut that out
anyway it's that certain information is
kind
of hidden from the public I'm not
talking about like communism The
Communist Manifesto stupid rote girls
right
but information like coax cables and
radio Tech we were talking about last
time I wanted to make video
walkie-talkies hidden on the internet uh
for some reason Cox cabl you can't
really understand how video this is this
is impressive to me right I saw like a
backup camera like on a bus the camera
you have the screen and then of course
the camera's on the us and it's
connected via Wu it's impressive that
you can transmit video via Wu and via
satellite even Cox cables radio Tech
Network hacking all these topics
especially Network hacking all locked
off you try to look these things up like
this radio Tech like apparently some
company in 2005 figured out how to make
video radio walkie-talkies which means
they existed in the 90s and intelligence
agencies like they could have had them
if they wanted to right Cox cables they
exist you know you can go buy one right
now Network hacking you know what
happens because people get hacked all
the time and they say this such and such
happened or so and so happened right but
you don't really know how it happened so
all this type of information Cox cables
radio Tech especially Network acting is
all locked away from the internet locked
away from the internet but you know it
it's a a St that kind of also ties into
like back in 2003 four five six back in
the feature phone era maybe even all the
way up into 2012 13 like before the
water state area of like 2014 like this
is about so before the Galaxy S5 you
know you'd always hear about these
interesting things you could do on a
cell phone I remember reading this book
written in 2012 can't got a smartphone
about all the mapping stuff that he was
doing on his phone now right but
apparently now the top
applications at least a week ago which
just like we you know we've gone through
this multiple times Tik Tok and some
random communication application yes
chat gbt but asking no ridiculous
questions or just basically asking to
cheat on the homework but there's so
much out there and I find myself reading
some of the few news websites a day or
some a few websites a day right doesn't
doesn't matter what kind of website
right there's so much information out
there but it's so hard to find it's like
that we've lost our drive we lost our
determination and now certain
information like Cox cables radi Tech
nwork hacking has all gone away and now
it's like what what do we even have
computers for what do we even have the
internet for right people in the 90s and
the early 2000s saw it as an
aspirational thing and we have to ask is
web surfing dead is web surfing dead
right you know you you see in movies in
TV shows like this this second is like
Zoe 101 2005 to like 2007 right she gets
the sidekick phone and they say like a
big feature of it is web and instant
messaging and people were excited about
that but people don't really seem as
excited about that now but it's amazing
and it's impressive and you know you
want to know how this kind of stuff
worked you want to know how to hack you
want to know how to break it and it's
just
gone like I I try to find these hacking
tutorials you can't find them right you
want to find these stories of kids who
did amazing great things you did hacks
um you know we he in L all the time of a
kid to hack into the school computers
and change the grades we just heard from
kids cor about kids who ha into the
school computers and he was lat pruit to
change the grades we just heard
from kids
who who who've done this before Nicholas
Adams if you think of the people of all
you think about the inventes corner and
the imagination station you think about
all these people whove done great things
for society you think about radio
communication how this was a thing even
back in the 1900s and now we have so
much technology and now we can't maybe
it's gone maybe it's rediscovered I
don't know it's kind of sad it's kind of
depressing like we need projects
projects
today and I'm going to read this thread
to
you before you know we go into 3 hours
and 30 minutes of prayer for the Texans
as the to take on the
Chiefs and this is this about a kid who
um uh accidentally committed some f
these and missed
ANS and I'm going to read the story to
you I'm not going to show it on screen
because apparently has some bad r in it
but it was a kid in an IT class and he
had access to some of the district it
passwords that he shouldn't have had
access to right he knew the passwords
from the surveillance system to the
password that the school's it had used
to man to the school computers
right so they had to get a computer and
they had some of the it guys Keys it got
into the keyboard and somehow he had an
locksmithing app on his phone this is
like what 11 years ago no four years ago
a locksmithing app on his phone but then
that happened nine years ago so this
excellent and look at me I'm doing MTH
in my head right now on the Fly
impressive impressive I know 13 years
ago which means in 2025 minus 13
happened 2012 maybe even 11 if um if the
counter on Reddit is a bit off again
math impressive I can do on my head
that's CU I'm that red note
brand um anyway he opens up this app on
his pH and see phones were so
aspirational and cool back
then and I hope Samsung can bring it
back so he's able to get a key and he's
able to clone the key cards he's able to
hack into um the key card system the
find the D access and find the log
switches and everything like this and
maybe I'll link this to it down in the
bottom and he is able to clone their
Badges and we need to hear more stories
like this not saying people want to
commit crimes I'm saying people tell
them tell me stories about how they
commited crimes and if they have done it
and it's
within the statue of limitations they
will be indicted and they will be
prosecuted for it because I will come
down and I will find those who have Comm
crimes look to the kids who are under
the
bridge and sacrificing and sneaking out
of school
right you got what was coming to you I
wasn't defending the administration or
something like that you got what was
coming to you you broke the law and for
some Reas somebody well this against the
Bible the skip school yes okay yes yes
now look I like rules I like the line
right some people like oh well you see
uh well you know and then this is always
about bikinis for some reason
Isabella uh well you know bikinis are so
close to the line of being inappropriate
that we can just say it's inappropriate
I'm like
well the line is there for for a reason
right if you're as close to the line as
possible can be but you didn't cross the
line you haven't done anything wrong
right imagine if um you're playing
football and you try to tell the referee
is at the one in line just called a
touchdown no doesn't doesn't work like
that doesn't count like that right the
line is there for a reason and the line
to be strong and bold you cross the line
you've done walk but you don't cross the
line you haven't done walk
that that's how it is right even got
questions say anyway back back to back
to the rules right violating School rule
book is obviously against the rules it's
against the
B but you know we have to have some sort
of spirit of Adventure and
fun and bring it back to our youth so
they're not sitting around scrolling
Chinese Communist
spyware on their phones and as already
says go Texans yes go Texans they will
win and they will beat Kansas City in
Kansas
City and we we need to be more
aspirational if you're more aspirational
have more information and kids were
doing more things like making video
walkie talkies maybe they wouldn't be
sitting around on Chinese Communist
schooling applications and if we just
made it so that people who were 91s
according to the application obviously
we don't
endorce ranking people if we made it to
the people we nine point nine points and
over right but uh one point in IQ right
that said okay look you have a nice
space it's called Instagram you take a
picture you don't say anything life
would be so much better it'd be so much
better if these REO girls would sit
around and take pictures and post
themselves to Instagram and you can
criticize them all you want but they are
over here sing for the Chinese Communist
party and it's terrible and it's in our
app stores and they need to get out so
as CNN counts down the last hour of Tik
Tok I call upon everyone to count down
the last hours the last days the last
minutes of these horrible scum ridden
platforms that are known as red note
eleminate Tik Tock heck even timu
because we are America land of the free
and Home of the Brave and we are going
to promote American companies American
Independents the Americans are anything
yeah I think it's time for new Monro
Doctrine not one for Europe but one for
Asia it says you keep your Asian Chinese
spy app junk out of here so it's time to
go back it's time to use Instagram and X
it's time to use Amazon and
eBay and it's time to use not the boy
for c l get on my get on my social
network it's free not the
boy.com as an alternative to Tik Tock in
timu and especially red note it is time
to kick the Communist Manifesto out of
our country and make</pre>
