<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 42923 Snapchat AI, Edge, Samsung AI Image Editor is ...ok</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
hello everybody on this week of the tech
boy uh podcast
um yeah yeah we're going to be talking
about Snapchats Ai and how I have a
different take than many
um oh I forgot there you go
um how and why I switched to Microsoft
Edge and is it working and Samsung's
application so jump into Samsung's
application here
all right so Samsung released the Galaxy
enhanced X application verse 23 series
device items on APK on my s22 series for
some reason wasn't the Galaxy store for
me and it's an okay application some of
the features and they're already in
Samsung's uh Gallery such as the remove
Reflections it has an AI edit mode which
is basically Samsung's remastered this
for some reason no it also has removed
Shadows mode yeah it's nice but there's
no remove
person or thing moving it's just an okay
app whatever most of you just moved to
the gallery the most exciting feature of
Samsung's uh Gallery is already here so
if I were to say take a picture of
whatever so I'm gonna take a picture of
this podcast
and go to the gallery
there's a TI-84 right there you can just
hold down on it
and boom you have a little sticker of
what it believes you want to select then
you can copy and save as an image so I'm
going to do that save as an image and
it will be saved as an image you can use
a sticker you can edit it manipulate it
and everything like
surf
um so that's that's nice but Galaxy and
whatever all right um on to the next
story of the day which will be I
switched to Microsoft experience and
it's just a little lifelong it's just
been a little bit Macky for some reason
well Chrome was acting like you so I
supposed to say it still whatever laggy
whatever and oh my goodness
would you look at this
my most recent article the one about
inside the Matt wolf set is the number
three article on the tech boy number
three surpassing Niagara launcher review
so off that good news I have some bad
news to tell you about some good news
about it
the tech boy suffered an attempted hack
on its Facebook account
so
the attackers sent me an email to
claiming that my Facebook was about to
be deactivated I read as well it's my
beautiful Facebook but I didn't get to
see the email signature
um inside my email address sometime
right thankfully my antivirus APG
antivirus stopped the attack and click
and I just could have left it from there
but I investigated so since it blocked
the link on my laptop because of the
antivirus I checked it on my phone which
is it excited to be a cookie
session Stephen think which means it
somehow the attackers I guess over
unsecured Wi-Fi or whatever got my
Facebook session ID and
needing me to click on it right so with
however they got it the system ID which
means they'll if they click in there
with the correct session ID they're able
to login they have to correct
credentials without having to have user
new credentials so I logged in there but
then I quickly figure out what it was
doing so I logged out on Facebook so
then they couldn't access it there I
logged in on another browser not to
Facebook but it's the fake link and I
asked for my 2fa code to factor
authentication with received some key
attacks or
whatever uh and I just put in a fake
thing and then moved on so it looks like
a sophistic page I'm called I've been
contacted at an email hosting company
but then they called me writers that's
of course I didn't get to I have to call
them back next week
um but anyway that's an update on that
um
so yeah that's that's fat
um the other thing in Tech news is I
finally got beef installed on the
virtual machine I just need to set up
port forwarding so I can show it off to
you guys
and maybe next week maybe the week after
that
oh now let's talk about that Snapchat a
i Snapchat AI what's up
poor Brett Cooper Snapchat AI has been
released for uh I guess it's for
everybody now not just paying
subscribers and
it's supposed to be conversational so
it's based off of chat gbt but it's
blocking some of the things like writing
essays and whatever it's you know I
guess it's more school friendly because
the kids use Snapchat on their films in
school or whatever uh and this must be
like an AI friend in Brett Cooper's
weirded out and mad and upset about this
but
I don't know
seems fine enough like
I don't know what do you guys think
about AI friends all the AI friends in
in the app store right but AI friend in
Snapchat
to like text and talk to it knows stuff
about you it's learning about you which
seems to creepy people out but
all right I don't know
I think
but what do you guys think about AI
phones I think it's fine whenever like
in video games you can chat to fake
people and they'll give them please set
of responses Google Assistant you
already have uh
kind of conversational you can tell
jokes play games right as long as a
person remembers that it's an AI
like it's fine now I know she's more
like not into Tech but
I don't know what what do you guys think
about AI conversational Foods I think
it's I think it's fine but of course I'm
in Tech so I might be following my
vision yeah
but in Snapchat I just I don't know I
don't know how this is going to drive a
Snapchat revenant
like Brett Cup was made that is keeping
people on the app but isn't Snapchat
like a failing platform they need people
on the app
like oh it's Gonna Keep people
on their phones for long
you have it what are you going to do
with it just look up
this is uh I just don't really do
anything but they're just like
sit there and look at it it's like
that's a nice food
yeah like if you're gonna have kids
chatting on different
so what
get a life
okay whatever that's just my take on it
um I know people in my audience are
going to disagree but whatever that's my
take on the issue
all right so I wanted to show you guys a
tutorial on my computer wasn't complying
it was taking very long it's just gonna
be a tutorial about uh
all right
how phone it's gonna be like a little
mini hacking tutorial about why this
stuff can be dangerous but my computer
wasn't complying and everything wasn't
working hopefully I can get the stuff
set up and working well but I guess it's
this homework it's going to be a short
episode of the party cast so until they
do good night and God bless</pre>
