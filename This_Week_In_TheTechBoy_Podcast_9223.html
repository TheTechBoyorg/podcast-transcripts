<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 9223</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the this week in
the tech boy podcast let's play our
intro
song hello and welcome to the tech boy
This Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
hello hello and welcome to
lights
Ah that's better all right today we got
plenty to talk about
stories from the tech boy as promised I
promise you all the Boogie Board review
would come out and it's coming out soon
it's the first Boogie Board review it's
the boogie board Blackboard it's this
one here still working on it
if you guys want to add some fine little
changes but I thought I would just
demonstrate what the boogie board
Blackboard
pressure sensitivity looks like
right and remember if you're watching
please and then comment and chat
so the biggie boy Blackboard
and it's like not that's the one level
of pressure sensitivity and then you can
go fold on
that's another level of faster
sensitivity so there's about two levels
of passive sensitivity and of course
just a regular old boogie board still
works that you need to talk about the
magnets that are actually on the back of
you so apparently you can stick it on
something and of course the magnet
that's on the bottom of the device
that holds the PIN
all right let's get to today's hip bones
from dtecboy.org
and also detector work has a special
update for you all it is
that
well
according to this website we are this is
not the special update but I this is a
nice development we are the
1740 oh no that's not to be sorry sorry
to get you guys excited and hello to our
two
um
visitors
Tech boy is the hundred thousand one
million 485
251st largest website in the entire
nation of the United States and if you
want to find out how we figured that out
which today that's probably a bit off I
can look at it
it's using
um a software that's online for free
that's called
similarweb.com and congratulations to
not to be for being the Trump brought us
Christian faith-based website in the
entire United States and Robert Kester
says hello and that is a hello to him
and more from that to be soon we'll have
more from after being and also the
Google pixels tip to have a nice
software bump Google pixels finally
getting in with the updates they might
have five years of secure of software
plates which would be better than
Samsung's
um
support which Samsung right now is
winning the game at
um
before use of software's updates in like
five years of security about four years
of software for four-year security
something similar according to that
um now let's get into some headlines
from Sam mobile
because well that's not for example but
just from some Samsung news around the
uh like the digital world oh Robert says
that the flip five is up 700 pounds here
interesting interesting
um for those of you who don't know we
had a rabbit on the show in podcast
episode 11. this is like podcast episode
53. you've been doing this for a year so
podcast episode 11 Robert and I had a
nice talk we have to eat after and I
just get you some general Samsung news
and we'll get to the breaking disastrous
chat CPT news that's coming out I'm not
going to stop using it but you know just
maybe not use it for Bible study but
Samsung Samsung they they've launched a
new application it's not nude it's
an application that spit out but it's
now rebranded at Samsung food it is now
on Samsung devices
uh if you install it but you can also
get on iOS devices in the garage before
and the Play Store and it's also on
Samsung
um refrigerators smart refrigerators
um it's supposed to have ai
AI
go into it meal planning
um hopefully you guys can see this on
screen let me put it up for you
AI meal planning don't look over to the
far left
um that's the footage we don't look at
them anyway according to Sam mobile risk
recipe in Mobile learning episode rename
the Samsung food I downloaded the
application and the AI functionality has
not been installed or updated or added
yet and uh the second chat here Robert
here is saying he that he used to have
the S9 and loved it well I mean I guess
go for it I guess you can react to that
Mr Who's The Boss video then we can get
over to our gbt news and then we can
talk about Hyundais and Kias and how it
is apparently uh Hyundai's fault and
Kia's fault that the car is getting
stolen by criminals we'll talk about the
technological applications that are in
it just how insanely stupid it is and
then we will talk about
um
then we are going to talk about how it
is the second best tech website ish in
the Internet it's not really a tech
website they're about to take articles
not the bees birthday today and we're
going to wave the official flag the one
I designed but whatever whoever to
celebrate their birthday which was
yesterday but now let's turn to Mr who's
the boss who is may or may not be
switching to the flip five who I mean
Robin you could have met him before you
know in the same country
do you live near Nottingham
and asking
is chatting in his answer he could have
met Mrs Boss for all we know be sure to
subscribe so that we can well that he
can beat Apple that'd be nice switching
to Android here we go
did you download grammarly
all right so he's going to be talking
about switching to Android using the
Galaxy Z5 and we'll find out at the end
if he actually does it no he doesn't but
he's still looking for an Android phone
to switch to indeed switch and try
iPhone user for a long time now but last
and by a long time he moves like two
years once I switched over for my iPhone
14 pro Max the Samsung Galaxy Z flip 5
with no intention of moving back I love
the concept of this phone I made an
entire video when it launched showing
you how it's Samsung's biggest upgrade
yet and I genuinely thought that this
was going to be X
well yes but I mean honestly it has a
big Samsung fan here I'm sad the way
that they have fallen but there's a big
Samsung fan here
what was he thinking getting the iPhone
14
uh Max I think
great telephoto capabilities and
everything the camera's not going to be
as good as As on to Z flip even though
they're about the same size same size
system flips so this was the phone that
was finally going to convert me back to
being a Samsung user once again and on
the way I've learned a lot about the
state of Android versus iOS in 2023 how
Samsung's touches help or hinder that
and what a foldable phone is really like
versus a normal bathroom I wonder what
would happen if he drafted and also I
don't understand why it doesn't discuss
this 23 Ultra
so let's start with a center process
because it starts out fantastic it tells
you to connect both phones via a cable
and you'll be good to go in 30 minutes
then even WhatsApp the single most
historically difficult app to transfer
now has a move to Android button baked
in but then the first problem arose it
wouldn't detect the cable I went through
four cables before it finally recognized
one and then when it worked it only
partially transferred apps with very
little app data so you had to start each
one from the beginning the rest of the
stuff like contacts came in ribs and
drabs with some having to then be air
into everybody the only person who could
say drips and trabs and make it sound
very
official transferred again later with
the wireless method and WhatsApp just
all together refused this transfer no
joke it became my andritious evening
project every day for the entire first
week just to try and get my chats across
from this phone to this phone and for
the time being what I've resorted to is
to just link what's up on my new Z flip
to the main WhatsApp account that's
still active on my iPhone but what that
means is that I'm effectively still
piggybacking off the iPhone yeah so it's
basically like those iMessage server
Solutions
in which
you basically have a Mac like you see
one have iMessage you basically have a
Mac
um
because you have a Mac running iMessage
and it Simpson think to your phone
and then you send your message so you
can have that beautiful blue bubble and
I realize it's a green since it's at a
Mac and then the max send it to all your
iPhone telling French
basically that's what that is
and still need to use it once every 14
days so that I can think imagine the
whole I haven't used an iPhone every 14
days and actually if I can make it I
mean there are some things let's stay
logged in on my Samsung now all of this
hassle is definitely partly Samsung's
fault for making a Smart Switch app that
isn't very smart at switching but it
wouldn't be fair to give them all the
blame I mean you'll have trouble
switching from iPhone to any Android
nowadays it's simply because apple is
now more and more tying every single
iPhone app and feature into your Apple
ID effectively increasing the friction
that would come from exiting that bubble
so this transition was off to a rough
start but the software actually really
turned things around for me but simply I
love customization and you rarely feel
when you're using an iPhone like
lacking but it's only when you move over
to Android after a long time being on
iPhone that you really appreciate all of
those oh yeah I can change that too yeah
like on the cover display of the z-flip
series people didn't like that it was
only a few widgets there's like a app in
the Play Store to let you use four apps
there's some good light modules there's
everything in there that can basically
let you
moments so Samsung for example has a
suite of apps called good luck and it
gives you a level of control so
absolutely insane you could spend weeks
optimizing every single key of your
keyboards or adding in instant shortcuts
to popular phrases you can craft every
aspect of your own motion one that's
nice
I've used it sometimes but of course it
locks in the Samsung keyboard and I use
three different keyboards but I'm back
on Samsung now but I was like they're
just gonna like do a full reset okay but
and you cannot just apply icon packs you
you can make your own
compact before or like that shape yeah a
little one it's not a squirtle but
beyond but this phone reminds me of a
banana so I went all in on her and
what's really refreshing about using an
Android again is that when you have
those little niggles which I did like
how if you want to search for an app on
Samsung's default home screen you have
to execute some pretty Advanced finger
gymnastics or how I've got so used to
flicking down the control panel on an
iPhone to change brightness in one swipe
which again is not the case here it
feels tiring in almost all cases it's
just a case of finding the right app or
setting and you can fix it I guess the
point being nice I wonder what setting
it is to fix that searching for an app
because that would be nice like I know
you can swipe down and also you like
recommended applications and everything
and that's nice but I was the keyboard
will automatically pop up moving from
iPhone to Android it felt relieving to
not be so locked into one way of doing
it like I remember getting really
annoyed earlier this year I'd taken some
hour-long time lapses on my iPhone and
for some reason maybe the files were too
large airdrop kept and it also wasn't
sinking to my Mac via Apple photos which
is how you normally have to transfer
videos and all I could think in that
moment was I wish this was an Android
for like 10 minutes just so I could plug
it in go into the Android folder
directory and it's real sad that you
cannot plug in your iPhone to a computer
internet for files I mean what you could
probably do that on a phone from 2000 I
mean I'm pretty sure you had to
development 2003 to Silo ringtones and
apps if you didn't want to get a whole
data Gap you can't do that on iPhone I
mean security maybe but I'm pretty sure
you're gonna have you can't access my
iPhone's file system that that's
unacceptable
and just drag and drop the files I
needed to my computer the only thing
that really does feel like a downgrade
here is the face unlock I'm used to
using Apple's face ID for everything and
it's so reliable well I mean if I'm in I
wouldn't use face unlock on that Samsung
phone I mean I I use a secure complex
password I used to use fingerprint but
um and also secure folders but if I'm
able I'm useful because like his face is
all over the place if I got access to
his phone we got a 3D basically videos
of him moving around and talking and
since it's just 2D and not inflating
everything like that that just sticks to
think of it scanner I put a pin well
then so good that you start to forget
it's there not the case here Samsung's
Face Unlock isn't as secure so you can't
use it to authenticate as many things it
needs you to be closer it's a little bit
slower and since it's not using infrared
but your actual cameras do snapshots
your face which means it's a affected by
light so when you try and do this at
night the phone will actually blast you
with enough of it to wake you right back
up and be a affected by the quality of
those cameras meaning that it works
pretty reliably when folded because
you've got a good I think it's
interesting that it uses the back
cameras when folded up that's pretty
interesting I mean it's
actually genuinely useful instead of
cameras there but then noticeably less
well when unfolded as you have to rely
on this tiny sensor it's a pretty minor
issue you can't just use the fingerprint
scanner but it leads me on to what I
would call a pretty major issue yeah
the cameras when I first saw this photo
and I thought this is amazing you can
zip the phone out you can double tap and
get high quality selfies taken with a
proper set of cameras that that's great
but like
who takes selfies that much why would I
put down a hundred not done a thousand
dollars for selfies please tell me
I want to know the same set of proper
cameras that you could also use for
taking with
again that's basically iPhone 7 plus
cameras wide awkward yeah that was nice
back in 2016 but
come on please give us a Sim
please you've had zooms on the a 72
series which is cheaper you've had zooms
on the um
uh you you had like a flip out cam on
the a 80 or 90. you had zoom two times
on the Galaxy S10 from
2019. the only phone from that series
that didn't have a Zone but no not from
this S10 plus sorry the only series
was the s10e but it was 7.99 and it was
smaller this is a 6.7 and so I mean I'm
not saying I had three times that might
be a bit hard but
adding Zoom to the would be good is
Robinson
photos
like am I wrong here you're paying a
thousand dollars for a phone that if
they try to sell it without the hitch
without the back screen
sell that it's welded together would
anyone buy it no I wouldn't buy it it's
too narrow okay the cameras are bad the
battery life is iffy right it's the 3700
milliamp cell which might be enough to
give in the new chip
there's no in the screen in screen
um Telephone camera
in display fingerprint scanner that is
essentially a budget phone they put a
hand on it oh wow it folds okay now we
can set it four thousand dollars
and in some ways this feeling was
spot-on the fact that when the phone's
folded up its primary set of cameras are
already facing you that's really
powerful because it makes them the
default option it creates a situation
where the quickest way to take a selfie
is also the best way to take a selfie
and this works really well since you can
also use these cameras while propping at
any angle without the cover screen that
is nice for the 107 in I mean basically
built-in tripod and they've made the
navigation really natural too if you
just swipe to flick modes and you tap
the screen to start recording the
stabilization is pretty great I love how
Samsung makes faces look both crisp but
at the same time flattering and to be
fair also thanks to some pretty smart AI
the phone's ability to zoom in is not as
bad as you might think given that it has
no actual zoom camera but everything is
a little disappointing I mean for
starters while this whole time I've seen
it as one massive perk that you can flip
the same set of cameras to use as both
the front and the rear until I actually
used it for a prolonged period of time I
completely neglected the con that also
comes with this in the in its default
position you have no rear camera anytime
you want to take a video of what's in
front of you with one hand it's not tap
tap like I'm used to it is tilt the
phone up find a way to wedge your thumb
in which is pretty difficult considering
it's almost new cap now I'll push it all
the way rotating your finger because
your conscious not to dig your nail I
mean
maybe but who takes videos first of all
you shouldn't be taking videos
vertically unless it's important for
like a tick tock
record them horizontally
so you'd use two hands with it right
besides do you always talk about how I
found super heavy at 6.7 inches you're
telling me that you're now just taking
out of your pocket this one no
elves into the fragile foldable screen
half the time we then accidentally
opened this menu so close that and then
press and swipe out for the camera
followed by a final swipe to get to
video now I'm dramatizing this a little
bit to make the point but when you're
getting your phone out for the 40th time
of the day which I was just yesterday
because I was out doing houses and
needed to take photos of every single
room you really do start to think oh
this whole opening and closing thing
it's effort and that would a phone like
this really needs is a button that can
automatically flip the phone into its
fully unfolded position I mean that
would be nice but it would require
like from an old school uh
slip phone just like a police hinge and
if it had Motors those would drain the
battery and be kind of bulky because
you'd have to put integrate them into
the hinge
and you probably have a phone with pins
that looks like this
basically hopefully you guys can see
this
oh no it won't sing the video that's
unfortunate
okay
uh
anyways here's his project is Skip
because your conscious not to dig your
nails and to be fragile foldable screen
half the time I didn't ask yeah whatever
or if you had a button you might break
the screen and you would have a phone
that ends up looking like this but
bit there is no microphone that faces
you so you end up with this really weird
trade-off where you can either have good
videos but mediocre audio when you're
using this well yeah I mean I'm hearing
it
in this bed yeah a little better it kind
of feels like that the audio centers
left yeah left center right and it feels
like the entire Center is really good if
I had like a decent everything that the
entire center of the
do I you don't hear any audio coming
from there but you only hear it left
right oh you can have good audio and
then Mediocre video because then we move
the address but I mean if you compare
the skin tones in here that is that is
bad this inner selfie camera has a
microphone directly above it and let's
be very clear oh man that's off look at
this
basically this looks like something I
took on my kitty zoom watch when I was
10 from VTEC and not even a dx3 dx2 and
this looks you know that looks decent
but of course like that's what we expect
front facing camera so it's like I mean
the lighting place or something
it also looks like the front facing
camera zoom in a little bit more produce
some move okay
um but you see how you can see the
interface aligned you need to prick so I
can see they're taking surveillance
fixtures I'm not exaggerating the
quality difference between these two
sets of cameras anyone can tell that
one's good and one's not and to be
honest cameras aren't even the only area
where you feel the teething problems are
foldable I just noticed here at the
boxes of these phones and I can barely
see that it's black so it's gonna make
the phones right now but if you're
enjoying this video then it's up to the
channel would be
Galaxy brain oh Galaxy brain fits down
drinking ice water dissolves 67 pounds
of fat
if you're over 35 and the straw
now don't get me wrong there have been
plenty of moments where I've discovered
some new Niche Nifty perk from the fact
that my phone can bend yeah you can like
take your phone don't call me on well I
guess but don't steal me on this you can
take your phone and you're like it
sounds like a snap whistle
like how often when I film I keep my
phone on my desk and sometimes pick it
up to remind me what I wanted to say but
with this I can use the bottom half to
prop up the top off and I can see it
without even picking it up or how like a
couple of times when I've taken video
calls this new even sturdier hinge is
the reason that I've been able to take
them hands-free and actually cook
something at the same time it's
it's so seeing and refreshing and it's
in these specific moments that you feel
that way you guys think that Samsung is
moving towards affordable future what I
mean by that is that say after this 25
is 26 they'll cancel the S line except
for maybe the ultra because all those
camera says
foreign
series and that's what series is gets
folded into gz flip series once I get
the cameras right once they finally
figure out to like make the screen so I
don't I don't know what's going like
that once the hinges get better and they
get dust resistance and everything
that's come over the next Generation to
get the software just right you think
that they'll basically be like okay
affordable phones or the future now
those are flagships foldable flagship
and they have better video modes and
support and app developers are not
supporting them and snap phones or old
and I don't know if it's mid-range terms
and then maybe by 20 30 20 35 don't face
them out entirely
validation for straying away from the
beach and path and actually choosing a
phone that's a bit different but what's
main I guess that's nice but like I'm
gonna choose phones based on the few
features like I'm on my next phone the
people a Motorola ads uh
Plus a normal age 40 uh s23 Ultra I want
that let me do my cameras or
productivity
and also Samsung software we did such a
Bittersweet experience is that for every
single one of these moments where you
start to question why you didn't start
using foldables earlier something else
will very shortly come up to remind you
like the fact that the top half of your
screen on its own is not really big
enough to do anything with it fits such
little information on it but I started
to find I was scrolling twice yeah of
course I mean just Samsung Notes let's
be optimizing this like these
notification bars and shades they have
like some sort of teleprompter mode get
rid of that I mean every piece of screen
real estate matters here but I do like
that it goes all the way down to the
bottom as often and but I was actually
just better off using a bigger phone and
propping it up against something well
it's not technically bigger it's why a
little bit one of the things I was
really excited about with this was the
possibility of being able to watch
content in any situation and actually
have a great viewing experience because
the angle of the phone can be adjusted
but it only took two days of me trying
to make this work for me to decide
actually this doesn't make any sense the
amount of horizontal room you have to
display a video on this folded screen is
I mean that looks looks good to me I
mean I just watch a video like that I
watch videos and fiction picture all the
time so that's basically
thank you
three and a half four times bigger than
what I normally walks away although like
those black bars like it's lots of
wasted space if you could move it up so
some comments down there but I do like
that the player controls go down here
maybe you could get like a transcript
something you suffer captions but
there's a lot of plank wasted space so
tiny that I literally be squinting to
try and see what's happening and so the
compromise I've ended up with is using a
slight Bend to allow the phone to stand
up sideways so you can still get that
full screen experience and prop your
phone up without using a separate stand
but you just I think the phones might be
flat I don't know if I don't have the
phone I'm going to test this Samsung if
you want to send it to me if you find it
um but I think that you could prop it up
like normal it's 180 falling unfold
who's what was really exciting about
this which is being able to adjust the
angle and then the other annoying part
of this angle but
is that when the phone is fully open
if most YouTube videos on a normal phone
fill 80 of the screen here it's probably
65. I mean that's fine I mean if you
think about it the S6 basically it
bezels that big maybe uh note five look
four so
I mean it's not like losing
that much I mean
which is small enough that it starts to
feel like you're wasting space I mean
it's 15 over 50. so and that if you try
and enlarge it you're going to lose so
much information on the top and the
bottom that it's kind of unwatchable oh
yeah and I don't know what he's watching
because something
not that much but like if this is
basically zoomed in here we've got black
boys here and here if I zoom all the way
in
I guess you can see this because stuff
he was at the bottom there's also the
really obvious crease which to be honest
over time you do adjust to but it just
makes the phone a bit less cool and it
does also pose a practical problem if
you're trying to watch videos on it with
other people because for whoever's
watching from an angle you will
basically just see a big line over your
content the battery life on the other
hand pleasant surprise it's not even
being close to an issue for me it sounds
bad on paper with its 3 700 million
Power Cell but two things a I'm spending
a third of my time with this phone on
this tiny cover screen which is pretty
conservative on battery and B the fact
that the cover screen is the default has
100 definitely reduced the total time I
spend on my phone it's created far more
I mean I guess it makes sense like if
you don't wanna
with
flip it open but like
if it's already unlocked everything
for barrier between receiving a
notification and then getting lost in an
act that I didn't even realize why I
clicked I normally keep the phone folded
up on the desk I work on and then if I
get like a WhatsApp I flick to the side
I tap it to make sure it's not urgent
and then just turn the phone back off
since there's nothing I can do on this
cover screen that's actually fun it's
also not just I guess he hasn't done the
work too
do it so I mean
if we're going to cause a lack of a
feature a feature it seems kind of
appleish to me attracting I've said this
from the very beginning and I stand by
it in the long term but this ability to
create separation between the utility of
a phone and the distraction that usually
comes with that that is the single
biggest perk of these zflick phones so
am I going to well
I guess
stick to it is it going to be the one to
replace the iPhone
no part of it is the niggles that come
with it being a foldable part of it is
the pretty severe camera downgrade but a
big part of it is also the ecosystem so
I'm actually not really the ecosystem
but that's basically been oh I'm
switching down iOS I'm in Android for a
week let's see how it goes oh I didn't
make it guys because the ecosystem he
fussed whether my phone is an Android or
an iPhone but the one thing that is a
non-negotiable for me is that my
computer how has to be
for my knees through humidity
Final Cut Pro editing program and the
massive leadership these two are both
critical because I'm fully traveling and
I'm constantly trying to work while
traveling and so part of the city of
California
have you never heard it Avengers
Infinity Episode
Vision has to also be how easy is it to
live with an Android phone and an Apple
computer I mean I don't even use nearby
share and have Windows and Android I uh
I mean I should perfectly be synced up
my phone and be texting and everything
especially if I have Samsung no I just
like you snapdrop if I want to share
files
and like if if kids
if they want to like text message me
then they'll text message me and they'll
get a green bubble or like if I'm in a
group chat my mind the afford me message
from group chat so they won't have to
be affected by uh
snapdrop works if I didn't ask them
about that see if Snapchat works like
that
to be honest not a massive issue there
are workarounds for almost every single
feature but I have felt the lack of ease
I really miss airdrops that's the one if
you want to wirelessly transfer between
these two I mean most guides seem to
recommend Air Droid but it puts ads
right in your face needs a monthly
subscription and also still has a file
size limit even if you pay this thing
that sounds warp share which can
actually fool your Mac into thinking
you're sending from an iPhone but only
works one way and so the best option
seems to be snap yeah that's what I use
crop which looks like airdrop and even
feels like air drop in that you're just
browsing your files and tap share you
click via snapdrop and then it works
about 90 of the time for me as if the
website comes up you have to run the
same Wi-Fi of course tap on your Mac or
PC to send it but even that's not the
same it's slower than airdrop you have
one extra press on the Mac of having to
click download after the transfer is
complete well
I'm not sure about that you can change
it to settings but I don't know and it
also will not continue if you move
really far away like airdrop doesn't
matter plus yeah that's a basically
brand new update and like
you can just use the USBC cable USB C to
USBC it's probably faster anyway
it feels really weird not being able to
take my phone calls on my laptop
automatically like I used to be able to
I'm pretty sure there's software for
that
but I don't know it's probably limiting
himself with a Mac I mean Apple's not
going to make it easy for him to switch
my iPhone it was so handy because it
removes that anxiety of always needing
to sit within a healing distance of your
phone in case someone tries to get in
touch and also
okay
you can call back airpods become less
good this well yeah but everybody's kind
of overreated anyway
which is why people start buying earpods
because symptoms you want to be
different or something did I say it
didn't see if you want to be different
use proper English I'm talking about
other people obviously for goodness sake
but they still work but just as basic
bluetooth earbuds without a lot of their
key perks like automatically pausing
when you take one but out there's a few
more instances like this of the
difficulties you get when trying to fit
Samsung into an apple ecosystem but the
point is mildly inconvenient not
insurmountable and I'd be willing to put
up with it if the rest of the phone had
impressed me more because as well as all
these it is basically a mid-range phone
with oh look at it the the specs are
high-end but the cameras are terrible
the other difficulties I've also noticed
the signal doesn't seem as strong as it
does on my iPhone potentially since
there's more layers to travel through
when voltage the speakers aren't as loud
or as Bassy presumably because well yeah
because the speakers are probably split
across to make the 40 of the phone
Slimmer and the z-flip gets pretty hot
especially when charging or using a
mobile hotspot with my theory being that
it's more cubic shape and folded
reducing the surface area for heat to
escape and it's also narrower in the
adverb plus cooling just generally not
being priority here so I guess the
search for the Android that will
steal me away
continues all right great which what do
you think is going to be I mean this
would be like an ultra SMG plus it seems
like a solid phone in my opinion
um but that's that now let's go to
answers and Genesis who has this
interesting
um
a chat GPT
article
um you'll realize that they uh remember
that our most famous episode of this
podcast series of 92 views I think
um
is about antonyms and Genesis and me
reacting to their work AI software
um referencing chat GPT but this chat
GPT
um
this is worse chargpt created a uh
basically software that no no software a
fake Bible verse
um
that's been posted to Reddit
and
it doesn't exist it's not in the Bible
in any version in any translation at all
is this lagging for you guys
yeah so uh I'll link this in the chat if
you guys want to see this but chat tvt a
related to get that together I mean
that's that's
not good at all here it is Charity you
know it's a fake Bible verse my YouTube
live chat is disabled what okay I'm
gonna go check out what's going on stay
here
um we're going to check out some stories
and everything let's see what's going on
here
let me try that post it again
it says it looks like your YouTube live
chat is disabled see can you see this
okay you can sing messages that have
been sent by other people let me see let
me check myself out okay
foreign
I got some new subscribers
Shaq is disabled for this live stream
why
okay I'm gonna go edit the stream jet is
what makes this live streams live
streams I mean I might as well just
not
live stream and upload them and I'm
looking at it again because upload
speeds are absolutely terrible
um and of course then people require me
to edit okay no it's not made for kids I
mean if kids want to watch this they
could if they want to but okay here we
go I answered the question it's not made
for kids the live chat isn't working out
let me posted like
disabled okay no don't restrict
I'm going it anyways we'll share this to
you
okay yeah
hopefully you can see what this is
behind the scenes here
where's the chat settings if anyone
knows please type it into the
non-existent chat
okay let's just check this out
customization
learn more why is it disabled
it's not for kids come on
let's turn on live chat well
if you since you cannot live chat on
here since it's been disabled stupid
YouTube uh I will just link it into the
comments and if you guys want to ask me
questions you can send them to me via
email I guess contact at the techboy.org
that is contact at
thetechboy.org
and we have a very special birthday to
celebrate today
um
it is not the bee's birthday
um yesterday
launched three years ago even though
uh
something up
okay so in all the of this great site
the 12th largest Christian website in
the entire United States of America
I would like to present the flag that I
so lovingly made for them
zoom in and see this beautiful flag
Chloe react to some stories from and
since there was no live check today I
guess if you want to chat in on MTV and
ask me questions or contact me on email
or at the
techboy.org anything like that that's
fine we'll see if people come in that's
so weird
there is no lives
I will leave them live on air but
well here comes the time that you are
from United States you might have to
watch if you know that they're
trustworthy and you know that you can
believe what they are saying and that's
my flag waiting for today
as a famous person once said what kind
of caused phones Drive Nokia
yes that was me
um
and at family no one thought it was
funny but
we're going to be talking about Kia and
how people are saying no to it and not
know because the cars are bad or not no
because it caused a small I don't know
I'm pretty sure the cost of good and
like it's not too small
Kia tell you right
um
it isn't small to say it at least but
we got the New York Times over here at
least it's an opinion article it's
marginally rather than like an actual
news article but gangs of teams are
stealing cars and troves so they want to
blame the car manufacturers all right
Kia and Hyundai two Korean car
manufacturers you know a nation that
produces some of the best phones in the
world
Kias and Hyundai's are easing
to steal
therefore
it's Kia is in Hyundai's responsibility
that they're getting stolen
and it is not the criminal's
responsibility that they're getting
stolen and apparently these kios and
Hyundai's uh uh as Kia the Kia ultimas
as uh one person once said
um the Kias are getting stolen because
of videos on tick tock and they're easy
to steal and you know it's like they
don't use this complex lock system
that's been around for a long time
okay and they went the cities to sue Kia
in Hyundai
for making
um
devices that are easy to steal
first of all it is easy to steal me I
mean
it's even masterclass anything is easy
to steal but let's look at this logic at
face value and by Logic I mean
quote-unquote logic let's assume that I
have a Nokia phone right I set this
phone and
I have important stuff on here and I
have a pass at one two three four
right and it gets hacked and it gets
wiped and it gets stolen whose fault is
it that it got stolen
good say but it's my fault that it got
hacked and everything and whatever you
feel I mean a little bit if it is on me
for using the table password
but
you don't go blame Google you don't go
blame Nokia that your phone got hacked
and stolen what you do is you blame the
person who hacked and stole your phone
for using that let's use this logic
again say cubic casket you know
let's say some kid took just some girl
walks down the street sees the house oh
they have kiwi casket locks takes its
bobby pins out of her hair and goes and
proceeds to pick the lock
um
of course you can't even see the story
here it is whose fault is that you might
say oh it's obviously kiwi caskets folks
making terrible relax which I mean I was
able to pick one of their lives the
Bobby bit legally but
that that's beside the point it's not
their fault that they make alone
security locks this is the business
model you shouldn't have to sue them
because people
broken and into that which used to do is
Sue and arrest the criminals who did
this
okay let's take this logic to the next
level again let's say that um and just
something I'm using that sound typos
um say that Microsoft
and trouble because they don't they
don't Don't force people to use 30 digit
passwords and it causes Windows of
computers to get hacked a lot on
something like that whose fault is that
no okay unless if you look at this on a
deeper level okay
is it tick tock's fault that they're
allowing videos showing you how to I
don't know like still on Project a car
oh I mean it's not it's not tick tock's
fault that people are stealing cars
because someone showed a video of tick
tock I'm still
if I show you a video of
I don't know like a police chase and
some guy is running away from free
streets this doesn't mean that I'm
endorsing that and doesn't mean that
it's my fault if you decide to go get
involved in a police chase I shouldn't
be sued the video hosting platform
should be sued the only person who's
speaking in travel is you and on another
deep with that phone a payment a hack
uses USBS I don't know turn the ignition
in the in the car okay so um is it the
USB you can Swim's fault that I can get
a USB and it just
and I can turn it like that so the USB
Consortium be liable that you can plug
this in Internet to say also to the USB
design and make it more pointed make it
more triangularly
so we ban all USB sticks now
and it's not like the USB sticks are
hard to make I mean it's a little square
uh rectangle to be precise something
alternative like that right
the only people who are responsible for
these things
would be the people who are stealing the
cars and the people who are letting them
get away with it by trying to sue the
car manufacturers now
if you're saying that now if you're in
the market for a car
it's like I don't want and you live in a
city that's trying to Sue this in suits
people and everything like that I mean
sure you could say I don't wanna get
it's easy to steal that's fine
but even if you did buy a key on Hyundai
it's not your fault that they got stolen
it's not the um manufacturer's fault
that they got stolen it's not like
they're not putting locks on it and even
if they didn't put locks on it it would
still be wrong and it wouldn't be their
fault
right it's not like the car sucks you in
and forced you to drive
um and apparently these cards have been
decent climbs it's not like these cars
are being driven autonomously now if you
said these protesters they've been
stolen easily and hey maybe I believe
that um
band of testers were driving around
um stealing stuff but it's not Tesla's
it's Kia's so I'm not self-driving okay
um it's not like they're driving around
themselves it's not like they're forcing
you to steal it you whoever that
criminal was
did it and it's on you not the fault of
the lock manufacturer or the car
manufacturer or the software
manufacturer or the person or the city
government
and that's all I have to say about that
and now we will have some more headlines
and unfortunately
um I think I'll just stream for maybe
one hour this is no chat here so you
guys can't tell me what you want and see
if anyone's sending in any messages
here let me see
okay
I'm gonna tell people that chat is
broken for today's episode and the
internet's kind of slow for some reason
so I'm going to tell people
live
okay and we're just going to check to
see if people are checking out the
articles
okay so um
Galaxy
Samsung Galaxy is getting watch unlock
in certain countries
that's interesting
what do you think about Galaxy watch
unlock and of course I know that you
can't see so chat in
um Galaxy devices are getting watch
unlocked
watch and lock means you can unlock it
with your Samsung Galaxy watch
on where OS only watch it so it's always
tizen fans you will not be getting that
feature
here we go one year I watch
only Wi-Fi watch brings with watching
like feature to unlock smartphone that's
really interesting I think that's nice
and everything but I wouldn't use it not
secure right not easy here what is
secure but that the watch has to be
unlocked with the pin or passage so
that's nice it's better than trusted
devices according to
um this
oh when you have six that's your force
uh so stay in dark mode that's nice
that's nice and the Galaxy R5 moving a
Major Performance before oh that's great
um it seems like the device is gonna get
up here for like a long time I might
just cut this short because there's not
that much to talk about this week in oh
oh oh wait a second wait a second I
forgot I forgot
um
Google is unfortunately ending its pixel
past series of devices so that's that's
unfortunate
um oh dang Sam mobile what's going on
here okay let's talk about pixel pass so
Google is ending pixel pass no
um upgrade no more upgrades for
it maybe they're losing money maybe
people didn't buy it enough and another
sad cancellation that's going on here
which is
kind of said it's like one of the last
sebastians of interesting software and
like generally useful phones that I
never got uh the Zenfone series is going
to be canceled
um unfortunately the Zenfone series from
Asus is being canceled there won't be as
in from
10. I don't think there'll be another
one I think it's the last one
so that's unfortunate and do you know
what's also unfortunate the lack of a
live chat on here which kind of hampers
my ability to do anything like this so
we can do call-ins I guess you can call
it Google Voice member yeah let's do
that let's do that
um let's see if anyone calls in if no
one calls into the next 10 minutes of
course make sure you don't say any bad
words
um or anything like that I'll put the
number up on the screen so you can see
and hopefully hopefully the audio shows
um well so let's see if we can do a call
in
stream just like Vince Dao you know
coming up in the world I'm gonna create
a banner I'm going to put it on the
screen basically bypassing the live chat
it is that's our call-in number eight
four five three two eight two one four
zero let's see if someone calls in
that's my Google Voice number
and if no one calls in oh dang we got
like three texts and five calls or seven
texts three voicemails and five calls
and 47 alerts and they're all scams
outside for them
um okay let me see
all right no one's called in yet we'll
just wait and see um let me put it
online okay I'm saying we're accepting
call ins for the next 10 minutes
this will beat the
just repeat uh
I guess the YouTube chat moderation
setting that's going on to my one viewer
who's watching please call in on and on
on the screen that's eight four five
three two eight zero one four zero all
right and let's um talk about that so we
already talked about the Zenfone
I don't think there's a Zenfone for it
because that's like unlocking in China
or something like that
um oh yes so this is the Zenfone 10 it
does have lots of character oh you can't
see it um whatever that means hopefully
you guys are calling in let me see oh I
closed my Google Voice tab let me open
that up you could be calling for right
now okay my Google Voice tab is not open
so sorry to anyone who's calling in and
fix this online okay anyway right back
to the Zenfone
I don't see any oh let's check out the
news it's been canceled unfortunately
um did you guys like Zenfone series come
in comment below and call in to the tech
Boy show
um and Google Voice is still loaded
please give it some time
you know that's kind of slow today all
right here it is no one's called in yet
I'm gonna keep this open so that people
can call in and not be able to see I'll
turn the notifications on about okay
see anyone email in
sing the ovit support says
how would you rate the support ticket
you got oh okay
and let's see here
what's up call ins for the next 10
minutes
eight four five three two eight zero one
four
in our internet according to this is
really lagging make sure to call the
number below on screen eight four five
three two eight zero one four zero eight
four five three two eight zero one four
zero then we have our first calling
now no one
okay that's unfortunate I guess we can
talk about uh Zenfone 10 series oh wait
no
the Zenfone is going to live on Asus
denies this continuation with four days
ago from CNET It's Not Dead
Zenfone yes
zenfone's been resurrected I guess we
can talk about the Sony Xperia 5V which
unfortunately lost its telephone to a
camera
but it does have some sort of AI like
Sony it's not like they're gonna be
really good at AI
um
there you go
um Sony uh Xperia let's see like the
first thing oh no I accidentally clicked
an ad right there I'm assuming
Xperia one mark five
um
mini I think
what's it called no not the one mark
five the cheap one
oh just like Sony Xperia
oh wait that's just a film from 2012. oh
that's why these people are selling
weird pictures of it
okay it has a 6.1 inch screen no
telephoto uh it's the Sony Xperia five
five
who names these things
Sony
V
means five
okay
um
pretty sick Pole
kids and 60 but know what that means
okay
um anyway so it's the Sony Xperia five
five
um
that's a mouthful 6.1 inches come on
you're gonna make it 6.5 inches but it's
a it's a it's a compact flagship phone
um it's in between the square root one
mark five and the Xperia ten five
which okay and instead of exercise
um five mark four
so I guess it's the five mark five
and the camera because this is the
person calling to it has a compact size
48x megapixel display the 6.1 inch OLED
at this
display but it has a slow thing about
scanner guitar
underload no film will be first wait
okay better and it does have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and a Micro SD
card stock so I mean this could be
someone's next phone who's uh
this other Samsung and it does have
Sam's Sony's Creative Suite and great
battery life unfortunately there's no
notification of anything and no
telephone I mean I would recommend this
one if I had a telephoto but no
telephoto that's that's not good I mean
it's a pro great phone I mean I know it
does have a good cropping in and
everything but look I want to criticize
Samsung or criticize uh attempt for it
but doesn't feel bad anyways somebody
says it's uh five or five days
um
Let's uh you should wake up with 50
battery life after a full day of use
with the one five mark five so that's
nice I don't know if I can make with a
6.1 inch screen tell me call in on to
the tech Boy show eight four five three
two eight zero one four zero call in on
the tech boy
and you can have your voice and it just
make sure you don't have an April
fantasy or anything
like that all right so the Xperia five
mark five you can tell me what you think
about that phone would you buy it is it
better than the s23 series which one is
it the same size is cheaper at 7.99 at
9.99 it has probably better software
support and probably arguably better
software ish I guess if you need to get
decks and everything but there's no
microSD cards for our headphone jack and
you don't get Sony's Creative Suite but
you do get Optical
um
camera and you get decks
which also means you can use an x-ray or
display
sunglasses that some Gadget guy likes to
talk about
with that well I mean I guess you can
Master Sonic because Sonic also supports
video out not so sure about this Sony
but definitely sure about this and
a day unless you call in today it's
845-328-0140 will be on some Gadget guys
website I did interview this uh man in
September not September December if you
remember and this is his website
oh that's nice all right so AR glasses
are they ashamed are they not
did he call sgg a huckster
all right he calls the face displays
um and he said some things for movies
and concept demos and
this makes no sense watch out 4.99 for
Apple glasses okay Apple's not gonna
sell that unless a this is obviously
seriously real product but and that's a
um let me think
no no one's calling it maybe you can
text it you could also text this number
if you want
oh by the way um unless you have to have
an iPhone to use it and of course Apple
will gladly sell 49 million dollar
glasses that you need a phone to use for
all right
we're not anymore but
as you sound here companies like TCL X
will inrail different companies are
pushing the values of mobile Computing
and Technology the face displacement
like actual well I don't know they are
AR but not like
all around the building like high-tech
movie grade technology and gear and if
no one calls in within 30 seconds we
will stop this stream early because
there is no more live chat let me see if
the live charts back up
hello
nope it says the live chat is disabled
so that's it God bless Tech talk to you
later pray for the nation and remember
um
debt oh oh I forgot sorry one more thing
one more thing
um

a whole bunch of marketing texts let's
see if you've got any ntp messages
I'll check
okay and
X
matter may allow you to avoid ads on its
apps
why avoid ad John Meadows apps all the
time by not using them no I just watch
that but I've never seen an ad in one
type of day in my life
um but I use webchap I mean I've used it
to talk to people like a few times
big SMS oh
let's talk about that Samsung Samsung
has two messaging applications so it is
Samsung messages
I did this Google messages
right
those are two messaging applications
they both send sms's but unfortunately
there's no RCS supporting Samsung
messages anymore so I'm using Google
messages I was using Google messages and
I stick to it but Samsung's
customization is better you can add chat
room themes you can
um group your conversations manually
instead of having Google like forced up
by scanning the names the conversations
or whatever
um Google does have ai features that
will be coming in but I haven't signed
up for them yet so I'm still using
Samsung messages and it's kind of sad
that I can't use too much in your apps
one for people who I know I have Android
phones and RCS another iOS users
um and I also want to know if Sunbird
can group message for Io group message
it can be added to Quick messages
screen or blue
um lastly I would like
yeah Samsung I like RCS to come back to
Samsung messages so I can use it that
would be nice because like RCS people
and get the customization and features
that Samsung messages says so I am glad
that Samsung does include XP messages in
I'm not mixed messages but allow Bixby
to work with Google messages and I did
find one app that one of the app that
used RCS in the Play Store but it didn't
work no no applies working no ads and
everything so imagine if it's a scam a
fake or anything like that so I wouldn't
use anything like that for now I'm using
Samsung messages but if Google messages
has more customization features and or
maybe Samsung depreciate Samsung
messages then I'd use Google messages
um but that is all for real for now
checking in TV one last time that thing
came in one last time the Cardinal
number on the screen eight four five
three two eight zero one four zero oh
well God bless Tech talk to you later
and pray for the nation</pre>
