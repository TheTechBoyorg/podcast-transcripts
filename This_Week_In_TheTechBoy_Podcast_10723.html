<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 10723</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and if that
sound just triggered you well
um yeah so let's talk about that um the
little test alert cell phone thing as
you can see um the internet is still up
the cell networks are still working
we're all still here and are not being
mindly controlled by the government okay
um this this tone isn't anything special
it's just a stone being produced by the
speakers the planes are still still in
the sky
um so you know I guess the the the
predictions were wrong that this this
this sound
here but
um would mind control you and kill you
or drive your car off
cliff or break your cell pH on or
anything like that because um fun fact I
was able to download that sound effect
um off the internet and the clear net
two seconds before um you know starting
the episode
so if if it could mind control
people then uh they I doing a really
good job of you know keeping that Under
Wraps you know random internet streamers
could just just play that
sound
and you know
then they they be able to mind control
but of course that doesn't work you know
think about how shocked the novacom
would be
if I could just play that song instead
of having to like with a little novacom
helmet anyway let's get into Tech we got
to talk about uh space.com having really
really dumb uh articles um
the pixel launched with some new AI
features um and it feels like I've got a
really successful article um that came
out this week talking about how Alexa
needs be able to dimage screen or play
silk in the background
now I don't think it's able to play silk
in the background I mean that thing
probably has like what half a gigabyte
at most of Ram or Echo Show five at
these I mean maybe they upgraded it on
the later versions so I don't think it
could do anything in the background but
um maybe just maybe the Echo Show 5
could um play or dim dim the lights
because they did send in a software
update that means
the
um like regular mode like I say hey Alex
I play ke for kids radio and this place
the radio so I actually having to go to
the KE kids Radio website playing
something like down Lane playing if
interest how to see um like the regular
Alexa does have a night mode right the
the screen is dark it's off basically
it's not o Ed it's basically a dark gray
and the text like the time is Red which
is easy to see but not like super bright
super um glaring right speaking of
glaring we need to talk about space.com
glaring issue okay um
space.com is a future um publication
like the publisher future the publish
lots of tech things out there and this
this this article here is concerning now
here we go the article is called how to
talk to your kids hopefully you can see
it on
screen yeah there it is how to talk to
your kids about what happened to my adet
aliens is anybody out there okay first
of all the um the premise of this book
is a problem because you know aliens
don't
exist okay um they aren't
real and we shouldn't look for them okay
you can go check ERS and Genesis for
more on that um
anyway but let's just read out the quote
unquote facts that are in this book set
for kids okay so space . is interviewing
the author of the book qu what is
inspiration for this book when I started
doing the podcast I wasn't thinking
about the kids at all I don't know why
these add let me turn off
turn reloading makes of the chat's
working
today yes it's working all right the
book is a spin-off of the Wild Things
podcast I've never heard of it and they
were getting letters from the parents
who listening to the kids they were
playing these in the school and teachers
were using ad of the podcast in school
to talk about Evolution
which obviously didn't happen DNA
evidence in the scientific method okay
so two out three not not too bad
there so the inspiration of the book is
basically parents sending letters asking
for help basically and it says I think
the most important things about that the
question of alien life sits firmly in
the gray area well no they don't
exist and and then they keep going on
and talk about how there's no answer
just like there's no answer to the book
foot question okay even if B Bigfoot is
said to have existed some of the longest
living animals turtles there for about
150 years so Bigfoot probably doesn't
exist um
and they say in the society we go for
black and white right and wrong that's
I'm not so sure about that but you know
it's probably like a cool little you
know book but space.com had another
article that is you know slightly
works
okay here we
go
space.com The Theory of Everything
searching for the universal rules of
physics they're trying to capture the
workings of the entire universe in a
single
equation
okay and let's just see what the
questions
are
here right and um I'm actually going to
um answer their question for them okay
so if you want to email this episode for
to them that could uh
work okay let's go scrolling through
word of
questions
okay just scrolling through
here maybe this is the wrong Artic maybe
they had two articles about
it
well it wasn't a big thing so that's
that okay we're gonna we're going to
come back to this um when I find the
correct article but let's talk about the
Google pixel 8 and I must say it looks
impressive like very impressive oh hi
David high tech just popped in for a few
minutes hope you're good I am well thank
you so um let's talk about the pixel 8
okay
and the pixel8 looks very very
impressive to me you know there was a
price hike but it's it's fine it's still
good price R $6.99 for regular pixel 8
and 9.99 for the pixel 8 Pro um pixel 8
Pro is designed very polarizing you
could say um and let's let's look into
this so the pixel let's look at these
text specs okay and AI is a big focus of
the pixel um brand now so they moved
away from boys they kind of moved away
from camera um David says you're so
polite it's nice to s in a young man
well thank you um they they've kind of
moved away from camera they're still
focusing on that um but let me look at
this $66.99 okay so it it's comp
competition would probably be like the
OnePlus 11 or OnePlus 12 that may be
coming out iPhone 14 SL 15 okay in that
price range iPhone5 $100 more iPhone
14 maybe you know coming down oh you
can't see it okay there we go maybe
coming down in price that's just the
older uh device 6.2 inch display so they
yeah they slash the display size okay
this is like their smallish Flagship has
a super smooth display 120 HZ 60 120 not
ltp but it's nice to see this getting a
120 hoods boost um over 90 HS from last
year
uh super bright display at 2,000 nits um
that's better than the s22 plus better I
think than the s23 plus even and the
pixel8 pro goes up to an insane uh 200
2,400 nits so great outdoor visibility
there like my s22 plus
is I'd say good enough outside like when
it's super bright you can you can still
see but you sometimes see the like
fingerprints it's smic covering the
display um but at 2000 and especially at
2400 it's I'm pretty sure even in the
hot Texas
Sun it would it would still be visible
that's like almost a thousand nits over
myph and has all like color support
whatever okay no Beyond 24-hour battery
life 72 hour battery life with extreme
battery safer has about a
4,75 milliamp battery using USBC 30 wat
charging and these are just like typical
like nominal spec bumps but if we look
at the overview you you get a free VPN a
titem 2 security ship and this big one
seven years of os Security in future
drop updates basically matching Apple Ty
yeah well technically they could be
beating Apple tying Apple doesn't really
like matter um because
I mean I don't think that people are
still going to be using a pixel8 seven
years later now this could be good for
people like let's say someone buys a
pixel 8 they have a child who's eight
years old five years later they upgrade
to say I don't know another pixel or
Samsung device and they pass it down to
the child with two years of updates left
on it so that is nice but I'm not so
sure how the Chip's going to hold up I I
don't know about overheating it's not
like really out yet um but seven years
of OS updates that's really good Samsung
into that game too I actually kind of
want a pixel 8 um I just don't know if
the pixel 8 has video out support right
video out support would be key to me
ever switching from the Samsung
ecosystem as a few of you know a few
months back like in June July yeah June
is my computer was slow so I just
plugged my phone into the Monitor and
did podcast episode right off of there
right if I had decided to get a pixel 7
instead of a pixel 8
I wouldn't have been able to do it and I
really hope that the special features
that I'm going to show you here that
come to the
pixel come down to the pixel 7 Series as
well
and okay they brought Face Unlock to the
pixel uh eight so I think that's that's
good
and pixel8 does not have any telephoto
so if you are looking for the best
telephoto um I probably go with the
Samsung s22 plus but these are the
features that you need to see these are
basically the Stelling points of the
phone now technically I'm pretty sure
these features what I said um what I
said is that Google's essentially
bringing Photoshop level features um to
at our fingertips right I mean these
these features are possible like I could
theoretically do what they're doing
arras something resize it move it but
Google is essentially making it easier
and calling it AI making it an exclusive
feature all right so magic edior I think
that's one of the most interesting uh
features
of uh all time that's been added to a
phone so you know Magic Eraser just let
you erase stuff and it feels in the
background automatically for you now
what this lets you do is you take
something right it basically cop cuts it
right fills in the background with what
it things should be there and lifts you
higher can make you bigger expand you
Etc now I mean that's interesting
but I
mean that that's basically like
falsifying a picture to the
point that it's something that never
happened in real life which I don't have
a problem with I'm not going go blah
blah blah no it's just
like I mean you can essentially change
reality on a Google pixel 8 series fun
then you have best take
which let
you take pictures and it merges the
faces on them so let's say you took
three pictures in a row of a picture and
if someone's blinking in one and
someone's and someone else is blinking
in picture
two it will MJ their faces together in
all the pictures that you took to create
the best one now this isn't automatic
you have to like tap it but I mean I
think that's a you know a good I idea
and editing and everything but I'm just
sure I I just wonder where this will um
take us this magicas photo on which
would their last year motion mode real
Panorama then this is new video editing
video editing um feature and I was
actually thinking about this right
before the pixel launch like you know
how the pixel processes
images after they're taken right most
phones do that but it takes just you
know a few seconds to process images
right before they're
taken to to make them better well
imagine you're taking a video at 30
frames per second that means it's taking
30 pictures a second I was thinking hey
what if Google would to apply its Ai and
vote editing um to to videos and that
would probably still even with the
powerful chips that we have on phones
right now would be near impossible um to
do well because let say you have a 30
frame per second video and you're
recording a 10 second video right so at
30 frames per
second that would be 30 pixels per
second in a 10c video which would mean
You' have over 300 pictures to process
and if you have about let's say 1 second
per picture to process that's 300
seconds so about 5 minutes of processing
time on video that's that's not too bad
right just come back and watch it do it
better but let's say you recorded say a
a one minute video right that's 60
seconds so that's 30
pictures in 1 second so 30 times 60
right that would be 9
seconds which is 15 minutes of
processing time at 1 second per um
minute right and you can see where this
is going it's not
sustainable make the phone hot I mean
I'm sure you could potentially offload
this to
a like while the phone is multitasking
but still that would be um kind of hard
but Google implemented this feature that
allows you to upload it to the cloud
where they have more powerful computers
and it will come back and edit the video
and I think that's really really
interesting um it's not editing the
video like adding text and changing your
backgrounds or anything like that just
enhancing it using AI or cloud computing
or something along those lines and I
think that's that's nice now one thing
that is on device that I wish I had
because I was recording a news video for
my school and the background noise was
so loud and I was trying all these
different background noise remov is that
you can on any video on a pixel that
doesn't have to be shot on a pixel or
anything until so any video so I'm
theoretically you could um take a VHS
and digitize it are record from the TV
and remove the background noise and what
Google does is they they intelligently
know what the foreground is and the
background is basically kind of like how
when you take portrait photos the camera
knows on your phone of what the
background is and what the foreground is
or they able to identify the Sounds in
the background like a dog bling or
something and they able to identify the
talking and you can tap a button and you
can um eliminate what you want so if you
want to eliminate The Barking or the
background noise and if video it will do
that for you under Google pixel 8 and
that's what I think Google needs to lean
in on now of course hopefully Google
doesn't screw this up and just basically
I mean this would be good for the entire
world of Android and of course I'm
pretty sure Samsung's not going to be
far behind adding this feature to their
their phone somehow but hopefully Google
doesn't screw this up and add it for
themselves and make it like a Google one
thing because Google one is just like
$20 a year okay so people AR just going
to like buy a a pixel like change
ecosystems jump from iOS to Android or
jump from a Samsung phone or a LG phone
well they might jump from an LG phone to
a pixel just because these features if
they could just go get them for $20
yearly on Google one as like a photo
thing like that's pretty cheap I mean
think about the the things that you get
You' be getting magic eras You' be
getting the video editing all this for
202 I mean there's not video editing
applications like shortcut which we use
to clip our podcast episodes and upload
them for later like watching like if you
want to watch a clip of our podcast um
that as for
$60 right and it can't do this yet now
of course all of these features can be
done on a Samsung phone like I can
upload my audio to the CL video and
audio to the cloud and eliminate
background noise okay I've done that
before and it worked once this this
other video had just way too much
background noise it just too c
um and I can erase things from my phone
I can do that locally the external apps
I can do that you can basically do that
on any phone right now I
can erase an image I can clip an image
save it as an image right erase it
enlarge it and like paste it as a
sticker onto Samsung gallery which would
essentially mean I
removing and erasing what Google is
doing and what it's basically bringing
it to the consumer these are like
Photoshop or like prish level features
that are just being easy then at attack
like I could as a technologically like
Advanced person edit an image the way
that they're doing it on Google
right like I could if I wanted to erase
the background behind my head well no
clip the image of my head right then
erase the background behind my head and
then paste my head enlarge it put it
wherever I want to right so what Google
isn't doing is isn't anything new what
they're doing is shortening the process
of of it right so I
mean and then they're also saying it's
ai ai ai which I mean what it makes
sense like they're appealing to the
quote unquote cool Factor um like for
Tech be like wow Google's phone so much
Ai and then the people just walk into a
Best Buy and like hey I want a phone
that was like cool what I saw on TV I
was able to remove the background noise
how it was able to move the image around
just a click right that will get Google
more sales like and that is good that is
good for competition what I want and let
me
check let's see does the pixel
8 does the pixel 8 have a desktop mode
okay there's a leak from June 24th
2023 okay let me see
what this is from Reddit four days
ago posted before the
event there was no mention of desktop
mode but of
course that doesn't mean anything
so I guess this means people actually
have to like go hands on and test it so
if I got my hands on a pixel um then I
would test
it like personally okay according to
this says us be 2. Z it keeps the SIM
card slot has volume controls has
buttons everything um along those lines
no satellite calling that support 5G
connectivity all right so overall a
really good phone um new T
G3 you
know just you know nice little upgrade
here it looks really nice um I I I don't
know how I feel about them making the
pixel
smaller but I guess if you want the
bigger phone get a pro and it just got a
the small little like $100 price bump
which makes sense because the pixel a a
like the pixel 7 a is basically the
pixel 7 now it does 85% According to
some articles of what the pixel uh 7 did
so because of that I
[Music]
mean it it's it's basically the same
price it's like pixel 7A is basically
the pixel 7 or a right and then the
pixel seven I eight is like the eight
plus would be like that and then the
pixel Pro is like a pro
Ultra right so there is there is that
okay now onto a cyber security um thing
let's talk about cyber security check
oh oh wow that's a neat little animation
though um I was checking score of the
Astros game and it put a like Giant plus
two too because last time it was 1 to Z
now it's 3 to Z so that's good all right
checking back out
um over to cyber security Now this this
is really interesting really
dangerous and we're g to talk about
it okay so if I I used to but if if I
had a compatible Wi-Fi antenna I could I
could show this to you but this this is
basically this basically means anyone
with anyone with the
um like let's say you're on
someone let's say you're on someone's
hot spot like phone hotspot since the
people who own the phone hotspot you
know know the password to their phone's
hotspot and they can change it or
anything this attack could be done on
you unwittingly not mention by the
people in your house because obviously
they would know the Wi-Fi password um
and it essentially means that they can
redirect the
traffic um and see your browsing history
as you see
it so let's watch you any website we're
not going to watch the whole thing but
the tool is called better cap and what
you do is you have to have access to the
Wi-Fi network which is why just is
dangerous on say a phone Hotpot because
you'd already have access to that and
you just have a a cotti machine or CI
Linux a virtual machine on a laptop and
you plug in your antenna I had to return
mine because we have a 5 gigz Network
right most networks are five gig but but
on a Hotpot you can downgrade you can
downgrade your um phone to a 2.4 4 gz
Network which means you can even use
like a trio Wi-Fi antenna then a 5 gz
Wi-Fi uh antenna right so you could you
could have downgrade your protection
intentionally well not protection but n
5 G protection but you can downgrade
that intentionally which would slow
speed a little bit according to the text
on my phone but probably notice anyone
would notice that right you can even
change like you can change your hotot
name to anything that you want so you
can pretend to be like Starbucks Wi-Fi
sit there
okay I mean you don't even have to have
like special technology for this right
you can you can sit there have have a
Wi-Fi hotspot that actually works on
your phone turn it on right you know
what I'm talking about like a Hotpot sit
there you know the passwords you don't
have to do any fishing attacks to get
the password um pretend to be Starbucks
Wi-Fi while sitting in a Starbucks maybe
some people connect you have your
antenna on a laptop to say yeah it's a
foreign laptop and Wi-Fi is different or
whatever sit in the back right you
already know your password you don't
have to compromise
anything okay and and you use this tool
called better cap and you can
essentially see what you'll see the IPS
and the network uh identifier or name
that's like MacBook Pro and you to see
what um websites they're going to and
you can even set a
trap you can even set a trap but it's
called DNS spoof right which let's say
that you know they're going to Instagram
they're going to Tik Tok they're going
to the tech boy.org right where you can
set it so that when that IP goes to a
specific uh website let's say they go to
the tech boy.org um oh you can't see it
on screen oh okay we see so so when when
that IP when that when they go to a
specific website like there DNS spoof so
let's say they go to the tech boy.org
right well you you using servers of
party to start which is basically a
buil-in web server um of course you have
to be connected to the
hotspot your own hotspot um you can you
you can host your own website which can
be a fishing website that looks just
like it and can take your information it
can be a beef injected website and
you'll be able to control their browser
it can be a legitimate website that you
want them to go to for ad Vue or
something it can be a it can be a
website that is legitimate but has a
like a virus Laden APK on it I mean this
this type of attack is dangerous it
could easily be perpetrated with like um
let's see I maybe like $30 Wi-Fi antenna
maybe even cheaper off of eBay a a cell
phone plan I
mean I wonder if even if you get a cell
phone player that can like sell Wi-Fi
like not not like a hotspot Hotpot like
a hotspot that's showing Wi-Fi that you
connected to that would be free if you
go to like Starbucks or something but
it's say I don't know a phone plan that
you already are paying for and a cheap
laptop like well not that cheap because
you have to run the virtual machine but
you know maybe like $500 something you
find off eBay something that can run
Windows or just flash Collie on it which
then you can just get a cheap that
laptop and just bypass Windows all
together so a super dangerous attack
here and this could also be done by
people in your house or people that you
let the Wi-Fi password known
to so you know just just bearware the
tour is called better completely legal
right it's not like you're breaking any
laws unless you do this against someone
who hasn't sented to it I'll type it
into the
comments there it is it's called better
cap so yeah watch out guys for um
that all right last week we were trying
to to
trace uh someone's
phone yeah yeah yeah but before before
we get to that um um I'm going to follow
this tutorial did you know that you
could get 50 to over
$150,000 of investment Capital at 0%
interest rates to fund any business all
right so first I'm going to follow this
tutorial to get K net Hunter loot list
on my phone so this will essentially
give me Ki Linux on my phone and I want
to show you and attack that you can do
using a unrooted Android phone and a USB
cable on a phone it's going to turn your
phone into a rubble ducky so if you want
to follow along with me let's go here I
just have my Android device pulled up
you have to install the net Hunter store
from this domain it's completely free
it's basically like a modifi version of
fdroid that
has uh Carly hacking tools in it
right okay I'm going to type in these
commands on my phone so it's t much
setup storage I think I've already that
so I'm just I'm just going to go to this
website and neat trick here guys go here
click that and then click create QR code
and you can easily send devices to uh
you know links to your device just by
putting your camera over and doing that
and remember guys don't scan you know
unrusted unkknown like just random QR
codes because they can be malicious they
can link you to a fishing
site they
can uh link to a beef Laden website
which if you don't know what beef is you
can go back a few episodes you have a
post on our website about that it's
essentially it injects code into a
website and it can allow people to do
all sorts of things on your browser this
works on all all sorts of devices I mean
it will work from a Windows device to
Echo Show to a Chromebook um don't have
that many good tutorials on it like we
we've tried to show how to like put
forward and everything with it but it it
didn't work wasn't working well anyway
uh so right now I put in the code PKG
which is how you install stuff on TX
install wte and now I'm going to re put
in
wgo install that 100 TX it's it says
it's missing URL oh I missed I missed
didn't click copy the enide URL okay so
this will download the program this is
the third line of
code okay it it's
working the next command I'm going to
use is shamad d x blah blah blah that's
just going to install it
okay so I'm copying and pasting this in
and that's basically what a lot of cyber
security in the in the terminal is
copying and pasting stuff from websites
legitimate ones of course you don't want
to get you know viruses or fake you know
things and if if you don't know and it's
working hopefully you can see this oh my
goodness is checking my device
architecture into the image I want to
install what does that mean okay so I'm
going to scroll
down okay so I'm just going to exit out
of this I'm just click new session and
type in the term
net it says command not found so let me
go back to command one it says into the
image I want to
install I just clicked enter it didn't
type anything in and it is installing so
I'm going to put the phone back on the
charger and it's it's loading here and
let's get our video set up um for today
we can maybe do some headlines and
reaction videos later after this I'm
planning on streaming for an hour and 30
minutes it's the middle of the 4th Astro
is still winning three three to four
okay
all right um it's still installing 18%
there so let's go to the Z
security which is a really good YouTube
channel um he has UD course that I have
right and with the video that we're
going to be reacting to SL doing if we
can get it to work today is hack Windows
using Android keystroke
injection
oh this is an ad I was say only one
minute okay so by the way we're at
23% so he's just gonna do his intro this
is the demonstration so let's just watch
this
probably faster too like on the T right
so here we
go he's GNA plug it into his phone and
he's going to get a shell on his
computer phone right this is on Windows
10 can turn on his webcam and there's a
ducky rubber ducky script there so we're
going to like finish watching when you
know this is when the script is coming
in at
29% so I guess we could talk about
another let's see what one plus is doing
right now let's SP the fourth three Z
let's go um let's see what one plus is
doing let's look at the Nord 35g because
the Nord series are some other series oh
might have been the CE yeah the CE that
was looking good let's look at this all
right oh I mean I like this design the
two the two camera design um but it's
actually three as you can see here oh my
goodness this website's terrible no no
no I don't want three off okay look one
right two two
three be paying me $300
okay
okay I can get a case for $1 that's
great all right now let's look at the
spec 8 gig R 128 G just switch basically
same specs as my phone right now okay
you get a free gift you can either get a
case or wild earphones I'd go the
earphones well I don't know this film
may not be that popular so maybe I go
with
the what would what would you guys think
case or
earon use bundle
on shipping it comes to the charger USP
a to see I think that's good all right
let's look at the spect 5,000 mamp 67
wats battery charging capabilities
that's that's really good uh 108
megapixel camera that's probably going
to be the start of show these two that's
probably like a def Cent and a macro
Cent so basically piece of junk here
honestly 108 really really good uh 120
HZ display that's good nice flat display
um I like Co displays but it is a nice
flat display right 6.72 inches that is a
great size okay I I am am a fan of big
phones and if you want to buy a big
phone don't for we are still selling our
TCL
40xl okay this phone uh has 256 gab of
storage 6.75 in display so slightly
bigger than this uh OnePlus um and a 90
HZ display with a 5,000 milliamp battery
okay but we're selling it for less than
one plus okay and I can link it there
here it R best phone on the 300 B from
Tom's goty wait that's that's all the
specs I
F okay
go all right yeah here we go we got
5G and GPS 32 5.1 we got dual ship and
micro SD quad slot support that's really
good and the headphone jack no wireless
charging
unfortunately um did it can decode all
these audio formats which we need to
talk about because I was reading
security newspaper.com
and the AAC audio
format uh was
was like able to exploit phones or
something like that all right we got a
240 1080p pixels D perfectly good LCD
display okay it does have dark mode and
120 HZ display right and we got Android
13 I mean what chip isun yeah but it
does have a695 I mean honestly this
looks like a pretty good like mid-range
disc phone if you're ask me I mean it
does have a695 which means it's probably
not going to last that long but like oh
it has a video out of the buil all right
we're at 54% on our
terx um thing so I have an article on
edge and speaking of edge we wrote an
article about it this week on how to
enable desktop mode TR check that out
it's in my mobile favorite probably the
bottom oh there it
is Einstein SC to know God starts take
Millennia that was our space.com article
so let me
um um find it here but according to PC
mag which yes I know that we're
canceling um oh this is from last year
but there some type of audio format
Expos milons of Android phones to remote
hacking that's pretty bad okay so let's
just
space.com maybe just publishing like
different
things like the same yeah maybe maybe
Live Science and Space
link or something there it is to OE toe
but answer all questions even nothing
answer why is the sky blue why is
gravity exist toe stands which stand for
Theory of Everything it would ideally
explain all Phenomenon with a single
Theory a single building blck and a
single force in this writer's opinion
finding the could take hundreds or even
thousands of views all right great well
I'm about to answer your t
e um yeah God made it
Done Right great all right and that is
the conclusion of today's podcast no you
yeah God God made it I mean that seems
like the most logical and easiest answer
of of all time like why why does gravity
exist why is the sky blue God made it
that way he created these laws in a in
in the universe right he likes things to
be
orderly and that's the why way things
work
right like that that is not a theory
that is that is fact God made it that
way um for his glory he he created these
laws so that we can use them to create
things and build things
and
and magnify him while doing that all
right now back to
OnePlus um talking about
the the uh
OnePlus like let's see if it's the
OnePlus fold coming out because a phone
did come out this week it wasn't the
pixel it wasn't MyPhone was the s23 F
we're going to talk about that and it
someone was right someone was talking
about how it is about their spare part
and it kind of was like that and I have
a very special thing coming out next
week we're going to talk about the power
of plane I finally got to take it out
for a spin today it was kind of windy
but I finally got to go to a park that
was big enough for me to fly it and I
was able to fly it potentially aided by
the wind because the wind was going that
way but I was able to fly it over a
ditch in the park okay I can show you
what the ditch looks like it the
greatest flight time of three seconds
but it showed potential it showed that
if if it's a not windy day you can and
and there's there's good control the
battery did die kind of quickly it's on
like 10% when I and I started flying at
5 5 4ish percent but it it did fly well
on the times that it did fly and didn't
get stuck in like the grass um I was
even able to turn it one time so yeah
Power Up um and I'm not the best paper
airplane Builder anyway so let's see if
the OnePlus 4 is coming out let's
see okay
bless oh the phone was shown off in the
October video it will be a
rebred oo okay and it is supposed to
release in October 95 to Google all
right let's check CET unbox therapy was
given a look at the phone but it's
covering cameras I guess so people don't
know what kind
it has
oh wow so it's actually it's actually
out okay I I hope it doesn't say
anything right yeah yeah great so just
in case he says something bad we're just
gonna like look at the images oh okay
let look at this oh that looks like left
does that look like left of you maybe
there's a
screen but this does confirm that the
OnePlus fold is coming out now on the
less exciting less folding side the s23
F the s23 fe uh came out or is going to
be released soon oh you couldn't even
see the phone well it wasn't that much
it's going to be available October
26 um and let's look at the specu I mean
I do like this design language people
have been calling It upgraded a54 and
I'm honestly this is probably what what
would have been the
a74 um s the uh telephoto camera and the
deck a phones didn't really get decks
they didn't really get telephone cameras
I think the a72 did though um which I
mean made me recommend it over the S21
because it had a Micro SD card slot in
it all
right but of course oh I mean this this
looks very professional it actually
looks like left I mean I wish that kind
of was left it looks like the um dbrand
skin that uh Mr mobile did which when I
emailed dbrand about their use of
expensives and how I wanted to test them
they just uh sent me more expensives so
you know kind of anti de brand um anyway
um now this is interesting the using
corny G glass 5 which I'm not so sure
about this like we use victus on all our
devices
now it is water industri resistance so
that is good and it does have a
telephoto camera that is good but the
telephoto camera is degraded by eight to
eight megapixels but it is three times
instead of two times or one and a half
times or what whatever right and it it
it just looks like basic like I mean it
is a 6.4 in display so there would be a
market out there for it it's kind of
like an s23 version like the
s22 plus and it's you know cheaper
um there's photo remaster which I'm glad
they're leaning into this we discover
old photos and sharp and blurry pictures
with photo remaster which I mean I'm
pretty sure this is Google seeing the
threat of Samsung seeing the threat of
Google like oh my goodness they have all
these features when we have these
features if people don't advertising
like if Samsung did advertising like
Google and apple were doing people
people would seriously look into that
like you can say I want the phone have
eras like I can you can erase stuff on a
Samsung phone like natively you can
erase stuff um
uh you you
can uh s BL pictures on a Samsung phone
but since this is an Fe Edition I guess
they TR like um I'm GL to sh the
features here like it's not all camera
okay well it is all camera like yeah
they need to talk more about that it's
just camera gaming camera gaming camera
gaming like there's other things you can
do with your phone like actually
call right but I'm glad they're talking
about the processing power and give you
legitimate uses for that processing
power give you live streaming video
edting in Social content creator a boost
well I'm not sure social content
creation would takes so much processing
power especially if it's so much of it
potentially be done in the cloud like
canva like you don't need processing
power for that but video yes um video
editing yes but uh I wouldn't
potentially edit Samsung video editor
they are much better video editors out
there and it is using Snapdragon H And1
which I'm nervous about it's I mean this
is kind of like an s22 Plus in my
opinion if the battery is better then
yeah sure get but if the battery is the
same I can you press CU it's like you
know Flagship quality and everything
let's see watch up to 21 hours list up
to 66 hours
um let me see let's see what the the guy
says
s22 this is kind of like a a me phone
right let's see but with the battery
life
of s22 Plus
like get the better life is about pleas
by all means potentially get this over
there 22 plus
um try to mot with the
Fe Tab and the Galaxy budge fing but I'm
I'm surprised they didn't have a an
event for this like Samsung literally
had an event for the A52 when I was
staying in Austin I think and I was like
watching it live live blogging it I
think we can pull up down article let's
see a
52 okay we'll search the website to see
if we have A52
A52
there it is yeah Samsung Galaxy unpacked
live March 2021 from March 17th
2021 yeah here it is right here Samsung
Galaxy A52 live March 2021 two comments
on the article which I'm pretty sure for
me
check I do like that our launcher is
showing two different articles at the
same time I'm going to link it here
there we go
um yeah
so that that that is that is that right
and stop the
so so yeah I'm I'm surprised Samsung
never launch for this like Samsung
launch they launched the A52 for grind
out loud like and that phone's like $100
right now okay there's no Samsung phone
like flagship phone from 2021 it's
selling for $100 in you know that decent
condition right so
I mean since we're already on the
techway website let's do some headline
here because this is our Flagship thing
as you can see here the ma versus M7
just wouldn't die but I'm pretty sure
this might be a a popular article here
we had the made by Google keynote and
the put Microsoft Edge mobile and
desktop mode okay so let's let's talk
about Alexa diing down this was a nice
little like YouTube thumbnail made in
canva um so Alexa needs to introduce a
screen off of Deming obson specifically
for sh silk browser
um for some reason they don't have
Firefox anymore so when we tune in ke
radio which fun fact I was interviewed
on so go check that out and it works
fine right however if you want to listen
to a program like d Lane Kids Corner V
ly you you have to access the browser
from from that right now we know that
they Alexa can damn it can get dark um
or potentially maybe play in the
background but that that is what we need
them to do we need them to to fix that
right so do you guys use still media
browser for
playback right like the the light like
everyone's like blue light ah bad bad
sleep right now whether or not it is bad
for your sleep right um this would be a
really big you know oh we're saving the
environment or the eyes or anything like
this and speaking of saving the
environment we need to talk about that
because that is that is honestly uh one
of the most annoying things about
companies these days are always trying
to save the uh
environment
um
without anything useful okay let's talk
about the the Google uh
the
Google yeah yeah this is talk about the
Google pixel or as I like to say the Pix
a i e l yeah let's make this trend um so
P AI
x e is that how I spelled it can't even
spell it okay let me let me check here
and we're just going to go through my
entire
uh my entire
uh thread like live
live live I basically live blog the
Google pixel event right so we're going
to go down to
the scrolling scrolling
scrolling oh man oh yeah we just G to go
draw this this is this is this is
great
okay all right we going all the way down
to the B oh my goodness I was I was busy
all right so talking about
the there we go my first I don't know
what they call these post right oh well
the pixel watch is made out of recycled
aluminum nobody cares like no one cares
okay that your watch is made out of
recycled
aluminum okay
right good for you Psy luminum probably
doesn't even last as because it's been
used again like if if you if if saying
this makes you feel better about
yourself but as long as you don't Val
the prices like saying oh well since
aluminum 50 like what are you saving the
fish like I don't care that your watch
is made out of a cycle aluminum it be
made out a cardboard for all I care just
make sure the thing thing works all
right now on to the uh the next thing
right has better patter life 24 hours
with the always on display turned on
which isn't that good to SmartWatches it
last at least a day and a half right I
mean the Apple watch Ultra
lasts uh 36 hours which is I mean that's
okay I mean that's better than the pixel
watch okay the next thing is safety
check looks nice but I mean if you lost
more than a day you're kind of screwed
like uh if you only last for 24 hours if
you if you get lost and they can't find
you when they find out that you're lost
and safety check just GI you GPS cor
like well just stay in one place I guess
the pixel watch Hot sensor has been
upgraded so that's good it's 40% more
accurate that's good including hit um
style uh
workouts right and you could have
watched the stream on the tech
boy.org
um and I just had a question here about
the captions like it was a live event so
who was writing the captions on YouTube
can you because I know on TV you can
like type in the captions and then they
show up on broadcast I don't know how it
works on on YouTube I don't know if
those a I generated uh that then there's
the Fitbit integration from the Google
The Google pixel thing which is
interesting they launched the new Fitbit
as well that had Google Maps support in
it and then there a personal AI coach
that gives you data that's what it looks
like it has a natural language model in
it and this is the AI and on to the Pix
ail thread and the the Fitbit um charge
six launched with Google Maps and the
pixel Watch 2 launched for at 394 USD
okay now I did like the blue color of
the Google pixel uh Pro I think it's the
best color of the year the pixel 8 has a
unified design let's see how much you ey
on it has curved back glass and curv
sides I think that's nice it has a matte
glass with a shiny camera which is good
but if you want to take a picture um and
you're looking at like you can kind of
like selft gauge and there's the Net
Zero no P packaging in
plastic in the packaging like whatever
like I'm buying a phone to be a phone
not because oh okay so we got the iPhone
15 here and the pixel 8 Pro here what do
you want I don't know which one doesn't
have plastic in the packaging oh the
pixel 8 does oh then I'll go with that
said I one ever okay they partner with
iix for rep abity no that's actually
something that you can you know get
behind and like buy because you like
which phone is the most repairable not
which phone has the least amount of
plastic one no one no one cares all
right 2000 it's brightness fin the
features talking about saving fish
that's good 2,400 nits there a
temperature on the phone that's good
really really like you can just I've
always wanted to have like a thermometer
on the phone I did joke that it could be
used to measure the temperature of this
tension chip so that's that's
interesting then there's the AI
enhancement the teeth text to speech
which isn't that special but I do like
that they are leaning into the clear
calling and call screen which is good
because those are legitimately used
features that aren't really replicated
on many other devices which is leading
me to kind of Wonder and Cera has good
skin cones you know racism or whatever
um so that's good best take versus
single take completely different things
but you know there's there's that to go
along and then I talked
about 50 50% of the spam is being
cleared out so that that is a good thing
spam calls are bad but hopefully it
doesn't filter out like legitimately
calls I heard about someone who was
calling for help and they just got like
ignored
um and then I also thought about how
funny it would be if the Google pixel
launch was held at the same time as the
the uh the test tone thing you know that
the the government mind control
plot that thing right um it would be
really funny all the Fones just start
buzzing that all at the same time
that like really funny of course when I
say on Pixel always the pro like I'm a
big phone here so I'm not going to use
some tiny little 6.2 in phone it's like
the size s22 plus and then of course we
like roasted Google
like I'm PR said that Google's AI could
have tell me that this is a man and this
is a woman and since I'm smarter than
Google's AI I don't need these little uh
things right there like that's totally
useless like useless uh propaganda
and like Jun it's something right um and
then the audio editing is going to be a
nightmare for o investigat TR to find
something great film is bad for o right
I'm both and the pixel8 pro can capture
in raw so that's good and it has auto
focus on the front camera and
unfortunately Google is canceling pixel
pass which is a sad thing now let's
check our turuk script and we have about
30 minutes left of the podcast episode
checking in it's still 3 to3 at the
bottom of the fifth all right so you can
read about on the tech boy right there
as we check into our TX script to see if
it's ready for
the uh ready for
action I'm just need to log into my
phone
here
okay it is extracting the
root after it verified the inte
Integrity of root
right so it's still uh working uh right
now okay so in a recent poll I think you
said that you want me to get a flipper
zero over the OMG cable so our next poll
I guess is going to be OMG cable oh oh
oh we need to talk about this calculator
I really want this calculator ask people
the test that they have at um but I need
I need this calculator okay I'm going to
show all these features that it can do
it's on the internet uh what's the
calculator called again in fact I may
actually buy this stick um tell me if
you want me to test
[Music]
it oh yeah num Works numb Works
calculator I verified it works offline
basically the calculator I mean the app
is kind of iffy I was trying to use it
it's all right I guess um but the
website really good because you can like
even code python in it which is going to
have an interesting AI second here it is
the numworks calculator I mean it's
basically bringing an app BAS design
this is what it looks like in real life
like if I had to calculate it um and it
can do your regressions for you even if
like like automatically so and the good
thing about this it's only $99 so it's
cheaper than the ti uh Inspire it's
cheaper probably than an 84 plus C right
and it has all the same functions online
you can code with it in Python and it is
test h test legal right and I did did
this like I
just I learned it in about a few minutes
like calculation really easy you can use
the keyboard you can use your keys here
um you can't oh yeah you can't type in
your okay um unfortunately you have to
use the like delete here because
backspace doesn't work and sometimes
when I'm trying to graph I think that
this is the enter button but that's
actually the back button so there's a
little learning curve to it but it's
really easy like watch this I'm just
going to type I'm typing in here without
touching I'm just typing in the keys you
just type in boom 6 plus6 you can get
your thing back in and then this boom
takes you to the home screen that also
this but would also take to the home
screen but I mean what really signs is I
think it simplifies things the ti can do
like TI can solve equations but it's not
as easy as this like boom you select the
type of equation you want um I really
hope you can see this oh you
can't okay yeah you kind of actually
have to see this okay here you go yeah
okay okay I'm going to go home I'm going
to redo all of what I just did okay so
what I'm doing is I'm using my arrow
keys to click this you can easily type
in your calculations you can either
click this button here or the home
button to go
home um let me show you this equations
what you do is you pick the equation
that you that you want here right just
put in this is all test legal by the way
um verified for the PSAT and the SAT I'm
just going to clear this all out
okay and if you want to delete something
boom boom add your equation I'm just
going to do a simp equation you say uh
3x
plus no let's
say yeah like I said my delete button
doesn't work here Y is = to
3x
plus and then what you do is you click
okay didn't
answer
you
solve oh yeah I forgot it's the arrow
keys oh my goodness and click enter and
then there's an in number
Solutions go back I'm going to edit
this oh sorry got you gotta click your
click okay X out of that add an
equation I'm just going to say
that
Y is equal to
two then you click okay your X Out solve
the system boom easy all of this test
legal right just designed to teach
people math right easy to deal in the
books and what I think about this is
that the regression thing honestly dep
best last year I had to do a project
about regression and you actually have
to figure out which regression was the
best you have to try all of them right
which would lead to about mistakes but
here just going to type in like some
random
[Music]
numbers right there we go I'm just going
to assign some random wire coordinates
here okay great
then click okay or just scoll up boom go
to your
graph and it automatically finds the
graph that you want and it it uses auto
mode where am I oh I'm still stuck
there
right and you can you can choose your
type of regression model but it it CH
chooses your regression model for you
automatically right
um
ex show your are your X Val well that's
just me tracing around the the
dots that's navigation Etc you can do so
much so so much more you can even uh did
I just see the
question oh I guess let say it twice you
can even code and python watch this now
since it's on the computer you get a
python shell um I don't okay watch this
I'm going to go as Google's AI um code
a okay great and it's this AI is going
to code the program for me while it's
coding the hello world program for me
and it can even like do some more
advanced stuff um if I had to calculate
in real life you'd have to type it on
the computer computer and didn't send
them to the device right it's all test
legal and it's still extracting the
routs right now all right so all you
have to do is type plint hello world
right okay so I'm
saying let me see this SP but
works back okay so it's shift paste oh
boom it allows me to copy and paste and
going like into boom hello world okay
let's say code
a okay this thing is going to draw me a
circle okay let's see if this thing
works okay so how you copy and paste is
you click shift or Alpha and then you
click paste
oops it didn't copy the whole command
okay I'm just going to have to copy so
import math I'm going to type that in
Easy just type in from your ke keyboard
and this works offline on your
phone okay I'm just GNA like copy all
this because I'm oh you can't see I
forgot to switch okay so I'm gonna click
here I'm gonna click shift and click
paste is that the next code nope okay
this is Def Circle radius I copied
that doesn't matter shift paste no
so I'm going to go back up here and put
in
my last
command import
math but you you can code on
here see if I can code you got it
sybol
and those of you who like coding can you
know have fun you have settings in here
you got a periodic
table
right so I asked the company if I can
test your
device it's still extracting the
vs
okay let's see if
still not working
okay well maybe you'll get to see a next
episode let's see how long have you be
been on here
um
well there there are other apps in the
store the the Ki store all right let's
see what apps we got here we there's a
showdown application there's a recover
router keyen which according to this
generate default WPA and WP keys for the
following Ros so if we had a WPA router
I think that robot that I showed here is
WPA I am going to upload a video of the
thing shooting so and we got wiggle WiFi
um which is in like the regular store so
there's like 10
applications um in here there you can
like try out some of them need to be
rooted some of them don't need to be
rooted um there's T in here T boot to
like different T much stuff oh it's more
than and then there showed on in the
applic in the uh think right I guess I
can show you like the video
now cover all of the things that you can
do using this met oh good news you has
to scored two more runs because that
will take a very long time I cover it in
my courses so check them out if you want
to learn more or simply look up in
Google how to use meterpreter to see
what can you do with this access but for
now just quickly so you get an idea of
what we can do all we did was plug it in
it's charging and the computer has been
exploited
surpris Mr hasn't upload the pixel video
yet first of all I'm going to run CIS
info to get information about the
computer that we gained access to and as
you can see we have the computer name
the operating system that it runs the
architecture and so on we can also do
help to see all of the commands and all
of the things that you can do with this
payload now just to show you that we can
actually do anything that the user can
do I'm going to try to access the webcam
of the computer that we hacked into
right now now usually we don't do this
in a real life scenario because it
leaves a lot of tracks and there is no
point of turning on the webcam but in my
demos I feel like it really gets the
idea across of how we can fully control
the target computer right now and use
all of its components so if I type
webcam and double tap we'll see all of
the things that we can do with the
webcam and I'm going to do webcam snap
first to Simply take a picture and as
you can see we have a picture here from
the target computer Keith isn't sitting
straight in front of the camera so we
can't really see him uh I'm going to
close this and let's actually start a
live stream so we're going to do webcam
stream and as you can see now we have a
live stream of the camera and we can see
the office we can see Keith moving and
I'm actually going to call him to show
him that I actually gained access to his
computer now that we've seen the attack
in action let's get technical and let's
talk about how you can actually run this
yourself the new best way to make money
online that nobody's talking about is
something you've never heard before it's
using remote automation scam so first of
all as you seen you need a device to run
the key strike attack so you can use an
Android phone like I did right here the
thing with the Android phone it needs to
be rooted and it needs to have a kernel
that is oh man it needs to be rooted I
thought it didn't need to be rooted but
anyway net Hunter has been configured
which means you can still do other
things on it so I'm going to run it
using the command net
Hunter I'll
try
um right back here
see this this saying you don't need
anything
okay n Hunter KS pass
the it's not loading right now but I
mean you guys can still watch the
game
oh man I serious do you want one of
those
for
so what do you guys think about rubbery
uh USB um
attacks
for
what does that have to of
water okay so it's downloading and
executing a file which mean you can do
uh like you know just like normally like
hacking just like send it to someone via
fishing email and you'll you'll
be uh hacking them right oh wait you
couldn't even see the video what were
you
watching
whatever and this guy here he has his
own channel so I'm just clicking this
because this is a good video it
basically tells you how to access
security cameras um by their default
password scanning the network accessing
the cttv by a browser so I I suggest to
you check that video out for strange the
default passwords but there are exports
out there for IP cameras out there
and
let's hey guys welcome to my channel
imagine if you had the ability to send a
link that could retrieve the location of
any user that clicks on it well we can
do that using IP logger so in this video
I'll be showing you an overview of the
IP logger
website so here we have the attacker
machine well you've used IP locker
before but it doesn't
I I get the GPS information that's it
okay this is the original link that I
pasted okay so I'm just going to go to
IP L and sometimes you do this with
scammers that's what I do I send them
the link and they're almost always um
from Nigeria I sorry and this is the
shortened or the new link that got
generated by IP logger and we can so
okay um so I'm going to click on here
hope wa hope it doesn't show my IP yeah
no okay no IP for you guys right now
okay so yeah sometimes use webs
like so what you do is you type
in I'm Type in tech.org you click it's a
short link and then just agree into the
terms and conditions Etc and what he's
doing all right back to the
video
what my antivirus blocked that
is weird
okay share
screen back to the video customize it as
you can see with because you can
customize it there CL sign of my IP on
the website yet so you go you can change
your redirect URL oh you can even add
your own domain
which oh you have to sign up okay um I
wouldn't send as IP loger let's say
let's see send it
as
I don't yeah all you website probably
going to be down um how about y that's
very legitimate okay this is
saying and if say the scam ask you for
an image you can say like do GI there
you
go save your link there oh that already
exists there you go you copy it there
and I'm back to the video Let's see what
he says I think I know what he's going
to do a different domain name different
on o domain name have to be the same
their data one program that I fully for
my business is notion notion is an
amazing
collaboration so according to this smart
data
um allows you collect extended
information on that you don't want
consent collection and I guess GPS
location but it will ask them for their
location which is a problem there's like
this hacking tool where if you connect
someone to your Hotpot and you you can
get their IP and everything Etc but you
wanted to see that camera but you had to
see
um but they had to consent to seeing the
camera and you also have to send them a
link so it's a bit if most people click
no on those types of things so let's see
if this link works I'm going to copy it
it's already copied here and I'm going
to paste it here
and it's been blacked by my antivirus
doing a good job thank you AVG not
sponsored um but let's see if it works
on my phone
okay I do have a fast anus on my
phone and my laptop doesn't even have a
GPS so it's not like that' be helpful so
I scanned it it's checking my browser
before processing I'm going to say allow
location and it's taking to the tech
boy.
RG okay now since I allowed it to my
location um I can't show you everything
oh oh oh most important thing the
tracking code save this link here what
you go is you go to IP
logo.com you go to iplogger.org Hope
good thing you see the tracking code
because then you'd be able to see what I
was
doing okay so you click it's tracking
code on the
thing
what and you just scroll down oh it did
get my Windows device IP address even
though it was blocked by my computer uh
let's see let's see what info I
got it did get my sitting it got the my
on it got the correct ISP it got our IP
address and the latitude and longitude
of our ISP fighter okay and for the
phone it
got
accelerometer add block turned on that's
correct Google pay supported so that
Apple pay not so this basically tells
you what kind of phone it is uh Android
phone it tells me my battery percentage
I think this is safe for you guys to see
oh you can't see the map
though there go yeah there go in Deal
Park all right there go um
okay it tolds you my phone's battery
percentage now that is that's really
interesting right there right uh it
tells you my screen size the color
gamut the network I'm connected
to if I had cookies enabled if I had
dark mode enabled that is
wow how much RAM I have this can
basically identify the type type of
device that you
have CPU T HDR Incognito not enabled um
yeah it didn't open in
Incognito what kind of language I'm in
if I have storage which yeah okay open
database pixel ratio platform Android 10
that is incorrect I'm on Android 13
plugins reduce I don't even know if it
is it got the time zones that's good
touch support Defender Google and it got
the correct time
the correct date down to the second the
browser I am using Edge 17
117.0 the ISP in yeah because I am
connected Wi-Fi so we just name ISP that
we have here which is internet
uh oops and I okay the IP address and
let's see if I got the correct
location
us Houston Texas R latitude and
longitude it's accurate from the
[Music]
wifi scrolling into the
map it did get our general
location like to like our house location
though it's not showing like the number
the house number and it gave me a
built-in a
fingerprint so yeah the Bas fingerprint
for some reason my phone's not charging
what's
wrong this thing
off okay so yeah easy way to track a
device right there just send the link
from IP loger provide for about two more
minutes where my phone not
charging I don't want to start an
electrical fire on stream that will not
be
good
okay maybe it's Outlet just broken my
computer's
charging okay well unfortunately my
phone is not charging but we did get a
view from the website I guess speaking
of views we can show you sweet tricks
let's see if that's
working um hopefully my login is good
and we were kind of down we were getting
like 20 29 viewers a day we normally get
uh
we normally
get 50 so hopefully this
is hopefully this week has gone
better uh we're down 0% so that is
that's good that means we're
just 21 28 32 all right so we we're
getting out yeah we've tried to that
really push our social media marketing
in uh Samsung M8 versus M7 that's still
going in if you check over the last four
weeks we're averaging about 30 viewers
is and if we check over the last three
months let's see if this month will be
as good as last
month so let's see August we had about
177,000 September we had about uh oh we
didn't in September one we only had
about a thousand and October it is a new
month 184 let's see let's check this out
on our numworks calculator um not
sponsor hopefully they do send me
something so you know be nice we we are
not bought of course um 184 by
6times
31 that is not looking good but notice
how it does our fraction so you know
that that is good oh you couldn't even
see yeah look there we go that is not
good we are on track to hit 900 and we
are only and see how we've like declined
yeah so that's not good um hopefully
this does get better um oh 130 God bless
pray for donation and Tech talk to you
later</pre>
