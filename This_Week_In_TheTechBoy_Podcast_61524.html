<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 61524</h1>
<pre>evening and afternoon everybody and
welcome to the this weekend The Tech
booy podcast today we are for the first
time ever in the techboy history
multistreaming on to YouTube and
x.com so be sure to give us a like uh
subscribe share Heart uh whatever they
call those things and what does this
button do here Emoji um yeah so you guys
can see me live on X um we're coming for
your apartment
um we got lots to talk about today the
Apple event came out Apple has some new
on devised generative AI features and as
an Android fan I have to say they look
decent and also Apple being Apple went
to
the uh board book and said hey let's
steal from Android again so they stole
material you and they stole the gasp
ability to um to move icons around on
the screen who knows what they'll come
up with next I mean they already got
USBC you can now move icons around on
the screen I mean I mean they're
probably doing this so the EU can't
force them to uh just basically
pre-install Android on their phones
which would be better for society but
forget the EU like no one cares about
them um anyway so yeah we got a lot to
talk about today and of course we have
some more of those anti Tech articles
out there but you know that's fine it's
fine
um so so yeah and also we'll be doing a
Q&A so if you guys have any questions I
want to see how can I read the chat on
here that's private chat oh here's the
chat here's the chat yeah so if you guys
have any questions um be sure to type
them into the chat and I will put them
up onto the
screen like this all right there you go
so commenting works right now so that is
a good
thing all right
interesting an AI candidate is running
for parliament in the United
Kingdom um oh yes here we go here's a
headline NB speaking of NTB um be sure
to check out our new socier website
notthe
boy.com not theeb boy.com Christian Tech
the social media Network teenagers allow
all right so anyway here's our um here's
our headline open AI as X NSA Chief the
board of directors they after saying
that they not creepy SP
and this is going to take us into a
thing that I was learning about on
darket Diaries which is apparently a
podcast of a bunch of um people who
delve into uh people do stuff illegally
online all right so open AI added X NSA
chap to the NSA Chief to board of
directors and people are upset about
there saying that open the AI the people
behind chat GPT as you know and some
other services um Dolly then the saw
video AI model generation
um people upset about this because they
think that
uh open AI
is gonna get spied on by the NSA and
people don't like the NSA because the
Snowden uh thing that came out 2013 all
right but I'm going to say here and I
will stand by this statement and and
even if you guys like say stuff in the
comments that I stand with and and for
the NSA um and what they do like data
collection um primarily signant within
um other countries and on United States
a little bit um it's it's pretty useful
now they have pedabytes and pedabytes of
storage and everything like recorded on
computer that's been recorded on
computers and probably have internet
traces set up and that's a good thing
now you may be saying well it could be
an invasion of privacy and Mar that
might be true um it's not just like
getting called up randomly for that a
few years ago someone did that with like
their software and I got fired so it's
it's wrong for them to do that not just
calling up calling it up randomly and
also he's an ex NSA Chief okay so I'm
doubting that he you know X means he
doesn't work for them anymore and also
unlike Jason Whitaker who's able to go
in and leave the agency and come back
and go in and leave the agency I doubt
people can just just hop in hop out hop
in hop out like why don't you lose
access to your security clearances and
stuff like that then you have to know go
back and get them again so it's not like
he's going to be privately checking each
and every chat GPT me message and
sending it to people uh randomly of
course now Elon mus a few days before
this happened said that uh open AI is
creepy spyware all Apple devices will be
banned from the premises of my companies
now that's hilarious that is absolutely
hilarious of his company so as you guys
know Elon Musk is the owner or CEO of
companies such as the boring company x
uh Tesla SpaceX you know lot lots of
companies you got Lance space uh
cyberspace nothing in see yet anyway so
Elon Musk is the owner of all these
companies do you really think he's going
to ban Apple devices from all companies
all Apple devices so that means
everything from an airpod to a MacBook
Pro okay and the thing he's mad about is
the chat gbt integration that they have
into iPhones which he called creepy spy
which it's not creepy spider first of
all the Siri thing is decent but very
clunky uh on purpose so you Siri a
question you're like Hey Siri uh can you
tell
me
what the time is in Hong Kong it's going
to you know to time in Hong Kong
whatever but if you say hey Siri can you
give me an analysis of how exercise has
changed over the past 50 years so we
might say you want me to send this off
to chat GPT and you have to personally
push push a button inant off
now um years ago years ago like in 20
2003 2004 right um phones are banned
from the workplace some sensitive
workplaces because people didn't want
them taking pictures of it so I am the
people behind Blackberry you know sent
uh made phones that didn't have cameras
on them intentionally and marked it as a
feature kind of like those phones that
can barely do anything but Market as
privacy or security or what it call
minimalistic features whatever so then
but they can probably still do more than
that any anyway so uh the Blackberry pH
R is that for privacy and security and
safety and stuff like that fast forward
20 years into the future um as you can
see phones are allowed nearly every
Works Space now and most phones have not
just one camera but two or three cameras
on the back of him and maybe one or two
cameras on the front right um
so this this band is not gonna stand he
he's just being and as much as I respect
him um Petty with open AI because he
doesn't uh like what they did to him
he's like currently suing them because
he doesn't think that they are
benefiting the human race which I mean
that's a fair argument to make since
open AI seems to be a bit censored and
have a skew towards one side you can go
back on videos towards that primarily
the uh an and Genesis video Read year
ago all right but I wouldn't call it
creepy Spyro and I actually think it's a
useful feature um a lot more useful than
what gim seems to be at least on Android
is now well gim actually I was using it
for a project here uh CH GPT was going
in there analyzing data from the story
and it did not want me to I guess it's
just kind of like food it stopped okay
so so first it going well right I had
gpg 40 enabled then I ran on that so I
went back to 3.5 and then it was going
well but then it kind of like froze and
stopped so I Swit with the Gemini Gemini
web and it was doing a good job it's I
until I came on here all right so Gemini
was doing a decent job but the problem
with Gemini is Gemini has zero
personality um Gemini has limited on
device AI capabilities Gemini is a step
down from Google Assistant all right so
reading an article about this a few
while a while ago Gemini you ask tell
you a joke can't do that you ask Google
Assistant tell your joke it can do that
you guys Google Assistant your favorite
food you can do that oh no G can do
jokes just doesn't have doesn't have a
person no favorite food no favorite C
like you ask Alexa or Siri or gem Google
assist that it can do it but Gemini
cannot do that it also cannot do execute
on device tasks which I mean why do you
even have this on here you can go to G
google.com for free right you don't even
need the app like why would you replace
it with Google Assistant like if you ask
Google assistant and if you integrate it
well enough of your services hey I want
you to open the camera will open the
camera no Bixby does a good job of doing
this too but Gemini Gemini um you ask it
hey want you to open cam open files show
me a picture of right local it can't do
that Ser uh Apple's intelligence
features apparently can't no of course I
don't have an iPhone nor do I have the
iOS 18
beta um so I wouldn't know but it
appears that gimi has a lot of catching
up to do as least as an on device
assistant now I believe that gimi
probably be better assistant than say
Siri would be right
um I believe it would just would just be
better but I don't believe that um
Gemini is good as on device
tasks as
well so Apple intelligence um which is
what they're calling it it seems decent
but not but gimi it really shows how gem
is just garbage all right so also now it
can't even generate images of people
which I believe app Apple intelligence
can
do um though you can correct me if I'm
wrong El can do Journal of emojis though
that's not as big of a feature because
um Android phones have also been having
the
generative stuff like that for you not
generative emojis but being able to make
your own emojis and also um of course
generative emojis would not work with
the consum the Emoji consum people so I
don't think that verifi you have a whole
bunch of random emojis running around
all over the place all right
right
um another thing that you would also
have to notice would be that the use of
generative uh Apple
intelligence features such as their
scheduling SMS and integration with RS
chats into the
uh into videos into their phone and that
seems like a good thing except the
problem is apparently it cannot schedule
sms's SMS text
without without
um uh the other user being an iPhone
which is just entirely silly like any
Android phone within the past I don't
know 10 years has been able to schedule
a tech has been able to schedule a text
but Apple only let you schedule text if
being sent to another iPhone that just
seems like gatekeeping and unfortunately
it seems like gatekeeping that only
Apple is gatekeeping them phone like uh
Android phone can schedule send text to
any phone okay you can schedule send
text to a flip phone a iOS phone uh an
iPhone another Android phone right it's
platform agnostic but it seems like iOS
phones are trying to keep their iMessage
interoperability um like
iMessage I guess a still you can only
schedule text if you have iMessage you
can only play those cup Pawn games if
you have iMessage you can only uh I
guess have the specific emojis because
I'm not sure how to J emojis will
transpire translate to the other
phones if you send them I'm Apple I
don't hear
anything there we go I just got blown
away bro what's wrong with my headphones
there's a ton of insane amazing and
Powerful features so so that uh lighting
emoji thing going around it was actually
Apple's generative uh intelligence
working to the end of the video to see
everything new coming to your phone
because there's a
[Music]
lot okay so right now I'm downloading
iOS 18 Beta And this is a very
interesting time for Apple because ones
that everyone has got to know about so
first up we're all in group chats and
now what Apple has done is you'll be
able to that but okay summarize your
messages and emails that's interesting
that's good but I'm
wondering all right so email
summarization features like that they
exist right I'm wondering how inoperable
this would be like you know Samsung has
their proof professional like they tone
changing that's
basic thing for any keyboard nowadays uh
the big tweak Samsung keyboard Apple
keyboard or keyboard or I guess Google
keyboard be more big but I haven't heard
about anything coming to Google keybo
right so those basic uh points now it is
interesting that it has table and list
and I hope this is all offline if it's
offline that'll be decent because it's
really good it is good to harness the
power of your phone right um I don't
understand why Apple putting the A7
bionics and iPhone 15s they're not going
to put this you know offline I wish
Samsung's proof reading functions were
offline because a it would be un
censored and B it could probably be
faster I got a snapon agent 3 here where
it should be able to handle proof
reading offline spell check come
on secondly there's now smart replies so
what this does is suggests replies to
messages based on conversations you're
busy wait what that hasn't been already
there I mean that that's already been a
feature on most
phones good grief having with someone
this is not but I'm glad it's on the
iPhone
thirdly okay so it seems like apple has
a mix of decent AI features which we get
to here into just some AI features that
like uh S9 has you can now text to Siri
so instead of having to talk to you've
been able to text to Google Assistant
you've been able to text to Bixby so
just a lot of catchup happening from
Apple here also you can now change icon
sh which I didn't even know you couldn't
do so I guess well I guess I guess it's
technically possible with those like
routines that go I click this
here do all the time you can just open
up the text section at the bottom and
literally ask her anything you want plus
she can do a bunch of new things but
we'll get to that later fourth is
something apple is calling gen emojis
which is basically like AI generated
emojis that you can send as normal
emojis or as stickers but you can pretty
much turn any idea into I'm just
wondering a how much would this feature
be used
and if it's server based you know have a
could cost on Apple if it's offline then
nothing um and also that's a pretty neat
feature to have offline AI image
generation also I'm not sure you'll be
able to send them as normal emojis
um party messaging applications
emails so of have just get sent as
images gen Emoji you can even emojify
people you've tagged in photos and turn
them into gen emojis nothing
groundbreaking but this is all just the
it seems like it's going to be like
those uh you know those uh Apple's
vering of Samsung AR emoji that everyone
has that's like profile pictures or
stuff like that it seems like that's
what it's going to the next
procus tip of the
iceberg whoo Nelly iPhone 15 with tons
of storage I really want one yo you want
that one
really so Siri has had a pretty big
update and she's kind of no longer a
voice assistant but rather looked at
like a device assistant and hero just I
mean that's decent but like it took them
that long to use it as a device
assistant a few of the new things she
can do straight up the bat she's got a
kind of brand new look where it's no
longer just that little floating icon
instead it's got this wraparound glow on
your screen just noticed that it's kind
of sad if you think about it and I think
it looks really good but aside from her
look one of the biggest new features is
is when you talk to her if you stutter
or pause she'll actually still be able
to understand you with those kind of
humanlike mumbles that we have this is
definitely something I'm going to be
testing because how well exactly that
works I'm not too sure yet then this one
is kind of crazy but she'll now also
apparently be able to edit pictures for
you so you can just that seems useful
let's see little Bix be here and let's
see if it can do this now of course more
people like move her head over there or
like anything gener
but um let's let's see what they have
here cuz like this Apple update is
substantial let's see here
um edit this picture to make it
brighter okay so it's appears that
Samsung uh so I went into my gallery and
picked an image it's able to open the
image editor and set it to the setting
make this image more
contrasty make this image more
contrasting wait edit this image
contrast and it can open to the correct
setting it open to straighten for some
reason um but it doesn't automatically
do it like if I say crop this image by
2%
crop this
image it tells me to like zoom in so it
can open up to the correct setting but
it doesn't automatically do it oh we got
o really here on here Tech I'm praying
sorry I'm praying for you your secret
godess P you be fine Lord willing I'll
see you Monday afternoon all right I
will be there and thank you for tuning
in to the
podcast just ask her how you'd like your
photo to be edited and apparently she'll
be able to do it for you and all of this
can happen now because of something she
can do called app awareness so she'll
literally be aware of the app you're in
and then you can ask her basically
anything you want to do basically
anything even like some trash third
party application that hasn't been
updated since
2009 within that app I think you might
be able to I finally got the 24-hour
time lapse feature
here on my phone let's test it
out all right finally my goodness
and a full review of this phone will be
coming up soon and a
case
neat to ask her to move photos from one
app to another and I'm not going to lie
if that's something we'll be able to do
that's epic Apple also mentioned that if
you ever need help with things like
settings for example you can just ask
her to help you and she'll show you
exactly what to do which this is useful
but it will put some tech blogs out of
business so that's kind of say of course
the tech blogs also have to tell you how
to use
sir let's see let's see and also you
notice this new feature of scaling a
text message okay let's see how can I
download an
app um and it just opens the Galaxy
store and and searches for the word an
because obviously there's an app in
there called an
how do I turn on 120
htz how do I turn on 120
htz okay how to enable motion
smoothness this case could be
interfering with the microphone it's
pretty
thick one is that the speaker phone it's
really loud that gets dumping cloud or
not speaker phone the uh earpiece phone
like car the Samsung got that right nuts
so I'm not going to lie I am really
pumped about the new Siri but whether it
turns out to be as good as they say it
is or if she can do as many things as
they showed that remains to be seen but
you guys will definitely have to stick
around for my tips and tricks on that
but for now there is still so much more
I got to show
you okay now this one is kind of fun
another brand new AI feat you'll soon be
able to do on the iPhone is actually
generate images again seems useful but
if you think about it co-pilot is
available as an assistant of course it
can't open anything unfortunately or I'd
be using it as my assistant but if you
can remap a button open up copilot boom
generate your own images to and it will
do a good job also um my favorite image
generator at least for um AA is photo
leap and you'll get more granula you can
pick you know her outfit and stuff and
you her
face
so that SS good but if it's offline like
if it's a better version of my story AI
app which is kind of slow um understand
it's a gigabyte file size um yeah not
new but still cool and what Apple's
doing is taking words and turning them
into IM can also do this unfortunately
not for people yet um with something
used to be a to do people but now it
can't do people because
racism calling image playground and this
pretty much works the same as all other
AI image generators where they use
prompts to create images so we've seen
this before but what we haven't seen is
AI generated images of people that
you've tagged in the photos app like
that's useful um at least for the
tagging here of course you can see that
this is obviously like
fake
um so I don't know if this is SAA base
or offline
again you have to tell me like just
imagine all your contacts turning into
AI generated images okay a normal person
and notice here have they have the AI
generated icon there a normal person
would be like imagine all your context
turning into AI generated images oh cool
that's nice some people be like oh my
gosh this is terrible it's destruction
of everything that we hold so near and
dear and and I don't know how we're
going to cope and and we ban and
legalized Ai and here a better let's put
it into a stop NSA is going
to like it's pretty wild in total there
are three different style types so nice
to be Tech positive and
not do whatever the heck that was choose
from so there's this sketch style
illustration style and also animation
style so I mean it's a pretty sweet way
to get super creative with your messages
or even your notes especially if you're
a visual person like me so for for a
company that's relatively late to the AI
game they are definitely giving the
competition a run for their money and I
haven't even gotten to some of the
really good bits
yet at Metro get a new iPhone 12 with 5G
I don't know what they mean by new like
does new mean four years old or does new
mean are they saying new as in like no
one used it I mean sure I guess it's new
but it's also four years old so there's
that take amazing pictures and share
instantly you don't take
yada so just like everything else the
messages app also got a massive update
with some sick new normal features but
also a few new AI ones for starters
there's new text effects so they're
pretty interesting and a lot of fun
basically if you need to highlight or
ACC uat a specific that's an interesting
feature not sure how many people are
going to use it outside the uh 12 to 24y
old age range um which seems like this
is a big feature for them
like I mean as you guys know one of the
most used messaging apps I don't know
why is Snapchat within their age range
you know you got deleting messages weird
filters I don't know how the app works
um stuff like that
so maybe this is a way to compete with
it I I guess because if more people use
Snapchat use iMessage and there's less
on their
iPhone specific word text effects can do
that for you and
you and your iPhone will also
automatically be able to suggest text
effects for you based on your
conversation again or with the power of
AI I wouldn't really call it AI guys
it's going to be shaking today whatever
I'm shed you know from that Gingy twins
video I'm I'm shed whatever
right
okay let me guess let me guess let me
use AI to pick from these seven things
let me guess do I want the uh the blow
up one or do I want the shaking one oh
yeah I want the shaking one it can't be
that hot like I wouldn't call it an AI
feature I call
that
guessing let me just take a breath
another big update to the messages app
is RCS support which is a good thing but
also a sad thing for me because I like
my Samsung messages and Google messages
is the only messaging app that supports
RCs for some reason like there needs to
be more there used to be 5 years ago
before RCS was on Android phones uh
widely right before people were like
expected to have it but know if iPhones
having it people going to expect you to
text with RCS it's a good thing for
security that for the NSA breaks my
heart
but with with with RCS right people
going to expect you to have it because
iPhones have it no you're GNA have 90
Android phones and one iPhone if they
still have SMS No One's Gonna really
expect RS what's this what you mean you
can swipe over like a modern messaging
application like Discord or uh Instagram
or something like that and and swipe
over and react and stuff
wow
um secure right but now Samsung messages
is going to be left behind and I'm going
to switch over to the inferior Google
messages which is like iPhone messages
and I showed an iPhone Yuzu right how my
Samsung messages could be grouped and
they're like wait yeah iMessage kind of
sucks like why is it why do I have to
scroll all the way down to find a
message like iMessage is Apple's key
product like you take iMessage away from
an iPhone give me the reason why teens
are still by like the prestige they
don't want be thinking they have a
poverty
phone maybe but
like I'm sure that some Android
manufacturers like get some random
famous actor or actress or something
isn't that puffy hair ice Spice Girl
having
Samsung yeah didn't see have like an s23
or something KY hook and get out of the
the
the some kid show me a video like in the
basketball go whatever you do just hi
some random famous person that kids care
about um
get them to promote the phone have them
rap about it in a
song like isn't there a song called Call
Me on no cell phone yeah we make that
and just say uh Z flip
five
boom easy product placement you got all
the kids on it like yeah if im message
is taken away from Apple they don't
really have anything here oh wow guys my
message jiggle and bounce and um I can
generate things yeah you look in the
Play Store you can literally get a
generative AI app there for photos
anywhere like tricks um literally
playground.com Leonardo
AI uh star Styler Ai and you know what
these things will be they're gonna be
more accurate they're gonna be new more
nuanced
um and things like that right so this
this is basically a kitty feature update
like some of the a features these right
I like them to come over here have them
more integrated with the manufacturer
and Soo based because it means you know
it's a benefit for your phone but
this this is terrible because now I'm
going to be essentially forced to use a
wor messaging application so either two
things
right Google needs to open up RS oros
depending on who it to have other apps
have Textra um Simple Mobile tools which
has ads in the phone app now it's kind
of sad uh Samsung messages with Samsung
would jum that but or at least make the
Google messages application better
right because Samsung is is is basically
doing everything you want right they
they're they're pushing assistant on the
phone they're pushing uh they're pushing
you a terrible messaging app on new
phones right you walk into the Samsung
store right you see all the new phones
they all have their built-in Google
messages there right Samsung's the what
you want let's make Samsung
good wow and this is a pretty big deal
because long story short what this means
is you can finally message anyone even
with my phone Android phone
freely using Wi-Fi just so long I mean
that's decent
but can you use an iPhone without
Wi-Fi uh no I mean not used but set up
freely using Wi-Fi that is good that is
good um it also is good it's G to bring
back the age of Wi-Fi communication like
I was watching this movie what's it
called Big Fat Liar it's from 2003 and
they're using a uh they use the this
like little video based texting
communication tool and it's good it
works and you don't need wires I would
like to see PE to PE uh not Bluetooth
maybe like some just like radio
communication come come back like if a
kid in 2002 can use a device in his
pocket to text his other
friend without Cal Towers within say 150
feet not 150 th 1,500 feet that needs to
come back to folks right we have what
can you do when this thing is Offline
that should be the selling point how
much much work can you
do so long as the other person also has
RCS enabled so I guess this is pretty
cool because you're no longer locked in
from iPhone to iPhone only you'll also
soon be able to schedule your messages
this is a small feature but nonetheless
I really appreciate this one then to
iPhones and they call it send later
like come on I'm pretty some flip phone
was able to do
that exciting stuff is in Apple's new
writing AI tool that comes with two main
features firstly it'll be able to
rewrite texts or notes for you anywhere
in any app on the iPhone so it can I'd
like to see that come I'd like to see
that um in action like if it works in
any app because I know that Instagram
Samsung's chat translation um doesn't
work which is such a shame because
that's where I get the most
multi- national lingual messages from
Ava Haru who gets messages from a whole
bunch of random Hispanic men like what
and it would be so useful to um be able
to chat back in Spanish use Circle to
search and Google translate or my Spen
hover H translation feature and we will
get into what a har has been up to later
W 270 followers let's go almost 32 go um
so we'll get into more a harer stuff um
so you can be in WhatsApp messages
emails or even notes and you can choose
to rewrite based on its tone or you can
describe how you pretty decent like
swift key Samsung keyboard already able
to do this so Apple's
late would like it to be Rewritten and
speaking of email all your emails can
now be summarized as well so you can Su
nice in the default message app I would
like Samsung to bring that Samsung email
so I can stop using Canary mail long
emails and even normal emails will show
up with a little summary in your inbox I
mean I'm not going to lie it's that's a
decent feature and it's a good feature
for children and adults Alik but mostly
for adults because for some reason kids
don't like using Emil I I really like
email especially back it's just a really
good feature and it's it's like the
Bedrock Bedrock of Internet civilization
um so email I'm just a big fan of it
that's pretty
cool okay now this one is kind of
hilarious but honestly I am just so glad
it's finally here even though it's such
a small feature I mean Android people
laughing in the corner and that's the
ab you can now move icons I mean iPhones
are just blessed
to edit your home screen icons like
Androids had all the glory for so many
years but finally iPhone is on board and
believe it or not it is possible that
iPhone may have actually done it better
than no they didn't those hes screens
are
atrocious and I hear that they're
unreadable but I'm glad that they can do
Android so you can move and place app to
be fair they had like 18 years to do
this I mean if they have 18 years to
move an icon okay it took
them 14 years to make a literal
calculator app for the iPad 14 years do
you know Samsung probably has a
calculator app on the
refrigerator probably have one on the
washers and dryers too
calculator would work on their
TVs no it's not on the refrigerator fine
that's okay but you know Samsung also
has a calculator app on the watch
okay come on 14 years to make a
calculator
app I mean at that pace the iPad will be
able to run Mac
OS uh in
2035 when um gas cars are banned from
California cons and widgets now wherever
you want on the home screen nice and
even though that is such a small feature
it does make a big difference but
there's also dark Mode app icons which
basically makes your icons a bit darker
whenever you that's decent switch over
from light mode to dark mode and on top
of that you'll soon be able to customize
the exact color of your app icons so if
you want them to be blue green yellow or
pink whatever it is you can literally
have them that exact color that's nice
and I like to see how well it does that
like my s22 plus you try to change
material you it would get hot one thing
I like about this s24 Ultra is that you
change the themes you go to dark mode
light mode it is not take a long time
you can switch and even it even had some
random restart yesterday even when it
restarted right you restart this you
turn it on the keyboard's not all tiny
you got the regular size keyboard the
apps are already booted up and loaded
like this thing is really go 12 gigs of
RAM it is it is a good phone uh we'll
get into the full video review soon back
today and I just freaking love this so
as you can imagine this is going to take
iPhone's customization to a whole
another level yeah from non-existent to
congratulations to 2009 while we've had
this on Android for a while it's just so
good to finally have it on an iPhone but
enough about the customization of the
home screen and then you know all these
kids are going to be running around like
guys look I can move icons on my phone
wow I can't believe it and people going
to get millions of Tik Tok videos on a
thing that some phone could get in the
middle of Walmart could do for
20200 not years ago 3 years
ago let's move on to the control
center like notification shade on
Android notice she switched her phone
out which is interesting the control
center has been the same old thing for
so many years until today it has a bunch
of new customization features just
atrocious starting with control center
Pages where you can find things like the
main page where all your normal tools
are then there's a media page with your
current playing media or even that is
terrible design I mean it's okay I guess
but that's kind of like you got a like
here on Samsung you can swipe down right
you got this but if it's a media plan it
would you know play and then you can
like swipe over down like this I guess
they did swipe down because everyone
knows Tik toac is the number one
app everyone's swiping fingers even a
home control page God damn there's also
a control gallery now very much like the
widgets Gallery where you can pick out
controls and add them to your control
center page there's a ton of
wow different controls to pick from and
other apps can also now add their own
controls to here as well you can even
customize the control size and exactly
where you'd like them to be B like
control center widget which seems like a
decent feature all right I'm not going
to say that bad that's a lot so what's
so great is now just like your home
screen can be totally customized you can
do the same with the control center and
make it exactly the way you want it the
lock screen also got a tiny bit of
customization as well and that's the
ability to actually change the corner
app shortcuts to almost anything you
want them to be why why didn't they just
make this
soona yeah I mean come on like my corner
app shortcut is set to six applications
from Samsung loock we got flight radar a
flashlight which opens um without um
having then we got the B lab Samsung
messages do not disturb which open
without having to do anything and the
can which
of unfortunately Samsung limited it to
six I don't know why but they feel like
10 down there if I could do
more go so guys I've actually been
waiting for this feature for so long and
it's finally here it is such a simple
feature but makes a big difference and
that is app locking so yeah actually
decent for um decide because like if you
don't know an external App loocking
application it doesn't really do
anything if you know the password
because you boot your phone into safe
mode boom you you're in right but app
locking on this side I'm pretty sure
Apple got the security down locked as
well of course hopefully it doesn't just
use your password because then you know
it's kind of useless um yeah so app
locking is good on Android side I hear
that they're going to make it so that
you have to install uh use Biometrics or
password to put in uh download an APK
which is good because the like those spy
M applications um
in order for an APK to install you need
to
verify which would be worse for people
having physical access to theone with
unlock and not ESP Bally triggering a
download by yourself iOS 18 will now
finally be able to lock any app from
Safari to our photo apps and even
messages just with face ID it's simple
it's face ID is broken though that is
like that's not a good see it's not over
complicated like on Android so thank
what are you talking about Samsung
secure folder is not complicated at all
it actually duplicates the apps I don't
know what she's talking about you apple
and to make it even better we can now
also hide apps from the app menu and the
home screen like literally any app can
be put in this new hidden folder inside
the app menu which again is locked away
let me guess let me guess
focus on the family Daily Citizen
says don't update to iOS up cuz apps can
now be hidden from prying eyes so it's
really starting to feel as though
iPhones could become one of the safest
phones in the world if not the
[Music]
safest so I mean there's a lot of
features coming to iOS 18 and that's
only the top features there's even more
are you guys coming
from Apple officially said that iOS 18
along with all the other features should
be coming out in full which historic
it's coming out
soon check it out or we got so much more
to talk about uh let's get into
our uh s24 Ultra
review yeah we got a decent phone here
got 5,000 minut battery s pin you know
all the features that you've come
accustomed
to here's what I've
noticed the phone is good right um the
performance is good apps open quickly
split screening works well right
unfortunately sometimes the software
sometimes just can't cannot keep up
right so let's say
I'm pulling down an app from the
notification Shades opened popup view
unfortunately it'll either come to the
side of the screen or the bottom of the
screen I do not know why okay um the
camera is good I like it a lot um the
high dynamic range is good you got to
you can something f with it in Samsung
xit raw um taking pictures on 12
megapixel mode is good um it's
fast but you know maybe 250 megapixel
mode you know you'll lose something
there right you'll lose some focus on
200 megapixel mode but 200 megapixel
mode does bring out more quality and
something like I blew it up on my
monitor I saw that the license plate at
200 megapixels was leible and to 12
megapixel so it is working well like it
is supposed to now as 's battery life I
don't know what's going on with the
phone maybe it's a bad unit from
T-Mobile or something but it it is not
doing a good job of battery life like
right now it's at 49% that's because I
haven't really used used it a lot today
right but let's say I'm having a typical
heavy usage day it will be already be at
six uh 60% at 9:00 am. um using this
phone like a Workhorse um uh Workhorse
phone for
60 at say 6 a so from 6 to like three
hours um it it just is like so you can
maybe get five hours of screen on time
out of this F maybe with all the
features turned on right um maybe with
adaptive power saving turned on and then
adaptive power saving doesn't really
seem to be adaptive it seems to be more
like when it 60% hits then it turns on
an Adaptive power saving which turns off
the 60 H which turns on 60 HS display it
slows down the phone to 70% and limits
the brightness to limits the brightness
by 10% which is fine like 70% is still
good enough CPU I mostly hit about 50%
CPU usage on some days maybe some high
RAM usage right and this phone does not
really get hot I was sitting outside
yesterday and only closed YouTube
picture and picture one time it was hot
yesterday and had this case on um the s
pin is also good right the response
times I feel like I could they could be
a little bit better at least when I'm
like scrolling up with it and also I
like to see more actions come to the P
so like swipe up swipe up swipe up swipe
up you can't do that all right hello
David and welcome to the podcast um
thank you so much um for helping out the
algorithm and thank you for your prayers
all right so like I I like to do some
more Espin actions come here like
sometimes the actions are hard to
memorize I like to see like the S where
swipe up swipe up swipe up swipe left
left right right um I'd also like to see
this button become you know useful for
something instead of just clicking um
zooming in also works really well always
on display is good the screen is good
um however it's been pretty bright here
in Houston even the 2,600 nit brightness
screen I uh I would like to be a little
bit bright maybe 3,000 maybe even 4,500
like the OnePlus um screen because it's
been so bright that I can still kind of
see the screen but the blacks get washed
out and also you will see all the
smudges on here and I have lots of
smudges on here because I used the pin
on the phone that gives lots of smudges
and then the smudges like much things
and make things hard to use all right
um also it's really easy to hold um but
doesn't because have this case on um GPS
accuracy actually falls to the new phone
for some reason no it's not bad it's not
bad uh plus or minus three meters of
accuracy or 9 feet in America of
accuracy it's not bad right I'm actually
G to do a test right now um that's
basically consistent indoor and outdoor
so that's good but for directions and
Google Maps at least for the augmented
reality directions it it it seems to
have a problem until I like use the
camera to get it sparing so the GPS
accuracy could be uh better I'm going to
run the test right now all right so
right now indoors it is at plus or minus
3 meters or 12 feet so something about
that but it is able to you know see the
GPS so is um
slightly
towards like into the yellow and and the
green uh in terms of GPS also the the
um let me see I'm going to take yeah so
GPS accuracy I don't know it could be a
lot better with GPS accuracy that's all
I'm gonna say for that I mean it's not
bad but I mean plusus 12 feet is good
but I like to see more of what the new
phone head which is like plus or minus
five feet outside maybe plus orus s feet
inside plus or minus two meters inside
um it it has lots of storage on here um
it it's fat
as what else so the snap Dron agent 3 is
actually too new to run any of the
emulation applications that I'd like to
see um on here so no win later no V VM
um none of that yet which is kind of sad
and I'd like to see a VM apps native
come to Android
um which is what I said um Dex needs to
get on all devices and things like that
now Samsung
uh Dex is good and I think my monitor is
bad right it s just lots of Disconnect
sometimes which is annoying all right um
it also has features that practic
features that the iPhone doesn't have
like a built-in app Edge and you can
scroll down and split split screening um
things like that with the six 6.8 in
screen the stylet all of it comes
together phone calls are faster like
opening the phone application is much
faster than overall on my s22 Plus and
making the call like from Dow to tone
to to it ringing um it's a lot faster
here the haptics are really good even
even probably even made better because
of the case um the keyboard pops up fast
when I have to go up to type something
um and it's been very
customizable
um 5G download speech are good um I went
on a road trip from Houston to Austin of
um didn't not St with any connection
drops Wi-Fi speeds also seem to be
decent sometimes this may be a teamable
issue switching the phone over to 4G
then 5G uh is better the five hours of
screen on time it's not bad but I like
to see something but I like to see eight
hours of screen on time at least um I
have not had this phone for a long time
so maybe I'll see that but my battery
case has really helped me out like
yesterday I got up oh not yesterday
account
um this let's just say I'm using a phone
maybe twitch 10 o' maybe not using it's
going to be all at 70% already which is
that's not good
um and I even have battery guarding turn
on so here by settings right
um app Trav savings turn on auto them
apps isn't turned on standard refresh
rate apps isn't turned on screen coding
is a decent feature that is turned on
that means you can basically turn on
always on display but still have an app
playing which is actually a good way to
get screen off YouTube for free
um Network power
saving okay okay so that can prevent 5G
that is it in the
background okay I think I was turn on
auto dim
apps um which means when app's not using
the screen with them right but according
to let's say thermal Guardian right this
this PH does not get that hot too much I
have it set to the threshold and between
5 and 5 so 5: p.m. to 5 p.m. 24 hours
right it's only hit it threshold three
times because of the
environment uh and high CPU usage I
guess Chrome uses lots of CPU uh and
charging and then in terms of CPU usage
like today I have not used my phone a
lot but um most of these apps here are
it looks like maybe 20 30% CPU usage oh
man eight people oh six sorry six people
wow that's a lot of people um and Memory
Guardian I'm typically running this
phone at eight maybe nine gigabytes of
RAM which is fine because it has 12 so
it had it's decent there right now it's
at 7.81 Chrome at least
the version of Chrome uses lots of ram
which makes sense um let's see what my
battery tracker says um and some of the
most used applications uh in terms of
battery life Chrome Samsung Notes uh
they're always on the display actually
uses 2.7% battery life so I might turn
that off one your I home which is just
to launcher uh co-pilot photo
leap it seems like some of the apps
aren't reporting their battery usage and
then screen on what's this
if you add it
up of course it's not also s showing
like I have Samsung not and Chrome open
and it said had two hours there and an
hour of Chrome open however the problem
with that is Chrome and Samsung not open
at the same time split screen so I don't
know how much it's counting that as the
same so maybe it's been on for like
three hours screen on for three hours um
and then 47%
of course this isn't completely accurate
and it wipes and stuff
so if you when you track the battery
usage
here this is in the last 24 hours the
phone was
[Music]
charging was it until 6 and now it's 4
and it's at like
47%
with like yeah that's not that good of a
battery life I wish the battery life is
better all right um other things to note
interesting features AI features work
really well the Spen is a really good
tool um so you can go in here here you
can make drawings and stuffff
um you can draw in the
calendar which is good I also like the
screenshot and screen screenshot
features so I just do besid screen
recording feature you can open a
magnifier translator which is okay at
best um the AI voice transcription is
decent but I do like the headens on
device and everything just it just feels
better I just really really wish the
battery life was a lot better just fine
um just maybe maybe some more some more
milliamps like I would not be I would be
fine with carrying a phone that was this
big if it had 15,000 milliamp battery
that it would take a really long time to
charge um charging speeds are good but I
have this on so this kind of limits them
because it has to take some of the
battery for it off and also no USB out
on the case so no decks linked up to it
so I have to take the phone out of the
case for the thing so
let's talk about the case review now so
this phone case is good I'm pretty sure
it support prevents drops like the
cameras are Expos a little bit but I
mean if I dropped it it' be really hard
for the cameras to touch anything unless
I drop it on like some rocks um it feels
like the battery is mostly right here so
I'm not sure sure how the shock would
transfer from the Hard battery to the
phone um to the phone the the phone
seems is very durable I'm G turn the
screen off U I do have like some micro
like scratches or braz in here and it's
really hard to get the smes off but no
scratches no SM smes on the back um the
titanium um side seem be holding up well
the glasses of course really good um for
the phone of course the speakers and
audio and phone call Quality was also
great sorry forgot to mention that all
right um the case is also it's a lot
it's very easy to get in and out of um
because I got the right model this time
instead of the s23 ultra model though is
a bit stiff um so here we go I have my
phone out of the case here all right um
notice that there's nothing out of it um
and you can
just squeeze it down push it in boom
really easy to put your phone into the
case and it charges when you push a
button on the back I do wish that this
had some more buttons um the power
button and volume button they are very
tactile they're right where they're
supposed to be um there's a little Notch
here for your earpiece speakers so that
is good um and of there's a notch here
for your microphones and speakers and
charging port oh also the s pin as well
um I do wish there was some more
functionality invited into this case
like this case is so thick that you can
put a button here maybe like a camera
shutter a command because I'm pretty
sure you can run commands to the USBC um
ports like just allow it as a out device
um I mean you could program this button
to be a command thing um like me say
like if phone is charging then do this
um it also is surprisingly light I guess
maybe the phone's surprisingly light and
then on top of this so it's surprising
lot now it is kind of bulky but it's not
too bad um if you have good Pockets so
maybe if you're a woman like this
probably won't fit in your scoot pocket
um anyway you got this it's like easy to
hold so if a video recording so if I was
still doing school new videos it'd be
good all right so yeah that's my review
on the new case I recommend it um I just
wish it kind of charged faster maybe um
and also had some more video out
features also it is tensy overprice like
you can get a battery bank for $16
10,000 Mah hours this cost 50 and it
combines a case which I mean you can get
a case with
$10 it's not even like a super
protective case it's not made out of
anything special it's not made out of v
and left or anything like to save the
environment so there's no reason it
should be cost it should cost $50 unless
say you have $10 battery pack plus a 10
10 $16 battery pack plus $10 case is $26
maybe this was4 $30 for five stores but
it's $50 but four four out of five
stores because it does what it's
supposed to do I think it also does
wireless charging I do not personally
have a stand so I need to check
that uh but I do believe also that's why
is charging um not of the phone but of
the case uh on the back I think that's
what this symbol means all right
um now let's get into some other things
here oh let's let's just do this thing
for fun I was just scrolling through as
you guys know I'm like a big uh like
high school I guess yeah
geopolitic GE politic uh fan right I was
just scrolling through a reading about
student council scandals I was reading
about this kid in high school this was
like five years ago back in uh not New
York California California and he
literally hacked his uh his fellow
students Gmail accounts 500 of them um
to vote for himself and his vice
president which is crazy like come on
and of course they found it because
there was a mysterious spike in the
middle of the night and also they found
its IP address and
also like they were all voting
alphabetically that was crazy um but
there wasn't that much information on
the story he kind of just like used the
school default passwords to log into
their accounts and get in and like that
was very that that been very easy to do
like I was worried about that happening
to me in my own election back in uh
22 um actually I wasn't worried about
that happening in terms of Elections is
where happening in terms of anything
because the school didn't tell us we
could change our default passwords I
have to figure out on my own um
so yeah anyway mysterious bike in the
middle
right um did some bad analysis on it and
they caught him and busted him foot but
I wanted to tell you about this uh
election out of scorge town I think
um it's new Washington
DC um it's it's a high not high school
it's a
college and and as I was fighting off as
you guys know from the SS ltw series as
was fighting off um random kids in 22 um
they fighting off election corruption
and buy
offs and a bunch of idiots and some guy
named Emperor P Palatine uh from Star
Wars running their election and a
Instagram thing so uh I found an
important it looks important newspaper
article and I found a Reddit article
about this I think I'm going to read the
Reddit and maybe some clips from the
newspaper just to give some information
all right here you go all right um yeah
so the school is acronymed
gusa for Georgetown University Student
Association all right
um all right so according to this gusa
is the student government of g USA and
apparently a year before they were so
incompetent that they couldn't Outlaw
themselves that's right they were so
incompetent that they would that they
could keep their jobs they tried to hold
a referendum of
to basically abolish or defund the
school government and replace with new
one but so few people cared about the
election they didn't get enough votes to
have to Outlaw themselves which is crazy
like shouldn't they be able to Outlaw
themselves whenever they want like they
actually needed votes to Outlaw
themselves and they couldn't get the
votes all right so it says most of our
campus since L USA they're wrapped up in
their own drama and Stu un but no one
cares about them right but the school I
guess is very prestigious and Elite I
think one of the presidents went there
Clinton um he actually lost the election
which is kind of funny like imagine
being able to tell your friends that you
feed the president of the United States
in an election uh he he lost a student
council
election
um but they so they have some power but
not all of it all right the the the main
direct power lies in controlling the
Student Activities fund uh which is
apparently $1.4 million which I don't I
know about you but if I control $1.4
million I would think that's important
and I care about the people controlling
$1.4 million especially if they bu at 20
old I show up to every election uh will
come to all the press conferences and
they do have like newspaper articles
about them like look they got the
Washingtonian I think uh the George Town
towan times wrote about them which is a
school newspaper which makes sense and
guess
it's yeah but this would have been I
mean could you imagine actually no
actually this would never happened uh if
something like this happened at my
school um the news wouldn't have
reported on it because when election
happened there was no news so when I got
voted in then there was
news but let's say I guess somehow they
spin off the news into a separate thing
because everyone knows the most
communist thing I've ever done was
literally create a state funded news
well not funded we didn't make money or
lose money um a state vun news agency
like yes I know that's basically
communist but uh it's not that many kids
so if we just run out the um if we let's
say they hypothetically spun out the
news into its own entity right
and they did their own
thing
then then yeah they would report on this
because this is crazy this is a really
long post I like well here we still talk
about the what is g USA all right so
there's brief description of Politics on
com Jo is has a reputation of being very
liberal I'm not sure if they mean like
you know actual politics or like School
politics uh but it's not the whole
explaining it could be a whole P of own
but for Simplicity people have a strange
mix of uh social values domestic policy
economic okay so politics foreign policy
um so that's interesting um in terms of
things but I don't really get how this
has to do with the election until they
get to the point where these bunch of
random kids are accused of being funded
by TPI which is crazy like imagine just
have this random group of outside grou
funding your election which apparently
can only spend $500 but it's crazy get
even the story it's even crazier all
right Alex first start off the oh sorry
uh the Alex started pretty normal those
kids which are called L and K president
VP running they had worked at the
previous administration they were
regarded as the favorites but they gave
you know pretty fin campaign promises
that they couldn't finish you know every
typical uh Audio Drama election slogan
right um they were trying to be popular
they had terrible slogans or whatever so
it's you know your typical election
terrible slogans but you know they're
kind of popular so they're gonna win and
then you got the second people W two
frat Bros with zero experience in GSA so
you know just some Outsider coming in
here which is fine but uh I guess it's
in 21 uh the very limited campaign
promises included getting rid of the
Mask mandate which okay uh 202 rting all
funding away from
snaps group test running underage
drinking on campus which I
mean another thing you guys have to know
about school politics
is that trying
to impress the administration with your
policies that you're G to bring is a
terrible idea because at least in high
school politics what the students want
and what the uh uh the administration
want or totally different things right
in 2022 I did not run on
Christianity because I wanted to
everyone knows that's a terrible
platform to run on like just as a
platform just by itself I didn't run on
hey guys um let's change all the
curriculum in the in the books to a
creationist no we didn't run on that
because we wanted to we run on that
because because for 26 minutes we were
press conference into doing that right
in 2023
election I run on hey guys let's uh
let's post the Ten Commandments in every
room and uh
like change the dress code and like
stuff that the administrators would
elect no that that's silly because it
the administrators cannot vote for you
at all right so running on stuff that
kids don't care about you you're gonna
lose so when you run on something right
if you if you were to run on say like
Christian values right and that alone
I'm
sorry it's you're gonna lose right um
because the administrators cannot vote
for you right now if the administrators
can vote for let say the administrators
at 25% of vote yeah run on that run on
that all the way through right the
strategy is to run on something normal
you know give out cookies and food and I
run on something normal it's let just
bring chains to the
school and then push those in when you
once you're in office because it's
unlikely that you're going to get
impeached unless of course you change
the rules for a specific position to get
your brother
elected like some guy did at Texas A&M
like come on that is
insane all right so it actually kind of
makes sense to do something that to
perform something you can't do to like
stop the investigating drinking on
campus which lots of kids would probably
want to that for some dumb reason but
yeah that's a probably a decent campaign
promise for the kids it's terrible for
the administration of course they could
shut that down
um and I I guess if you want to know
more about Alexon strategy you can get
into that in another podcast episode
right now to be fair I actually thought
about creating something like that uh
like a hall monitor thing for that um we
uh in a hypothetical uh 23 election that
didn't happen at another school um
was think about creating like a h
monitor program that didn't happen for
the safety of the school then we like
kind of test in it on chat gbt and on
NTV and they were like do you really
want a secret police it's communist and
I was
like okay but I was smart enough not go
like hi guys I'm running for the uh
student council here and I am planning
on uh adding New Hall monitors and
catching all of you and your secret
Fight Club and your your drug dealing
operations God bless you I would have
gotten one vote and it would have been
mine um anyway so yeah getting rid of
the Mask mandate I don't know I I wasn't
at the school so I don't know how
popular i' been and then getting rid of
underage drinking investigatory agency I
mean you can't do it but it is actually
a pretty decent platform uh not actually
something vote buying thing so w ran
they didn't care the GSA you know
they're just kind of like riding like so
um apparently Len K the gusa like Elite
had accidentally sent out an official
email using the superia account um stole
credit from other students and they sent
out an apology and then another Scandal
happened was that some party at a
nightclub happened that was allegedly
paid for by the womb campaign um because
a picture with the neon sign and Nam
campaign had gone out from an anonymous
source which remember this guys do not
if you're doing something
illegal
don't post pictures of it okay and don't
have your snapmap turned on um second
this this basically is like a thing
called waffle gate that happened at at
school U I wasn't there but I heard
about it they um overpaid their expenses
they could only pay $200 at minimum the
nightclub cost $500 plus uh plus the
alcohol was illegal at any school spons
event and also providing any kind of
offering Dev voters that influence a
bribe them with strictly prohibit it
which is interesting because that means
candy bribes and cookie bribes and Cake
bribes don't work which means High
School politics uh 101 just failed which
is give them lots of food apparently I
abstain from that and you see the
results of that
um so in February 4th roommate their
official response they denied connection
into the party uh the elting commission
of bias um and also they compared the
situation to voter suppression In
America which is an interesting strategy
I'll to say the least all right um the
third in in the campaign was if Chief I
don't know if that's a woman or a man uh
paltin and I've heard of this guy from
over NCP and they talk about him as
being evil and compar him to like
legitimate people I think he's like some
fat guy or something like that I don't
know um that's not a fake name the
anonymous student start an Instagram
account with this message
here who B said he's got to control the
school he said that all CL Club funding
would be immediately Reed to the Death
Star uh don't know what that is I think
it's some plane and St like that um
campas police could be eliminated and
released for the army of Storm Troopers
which
um yeah and the uh I'm probably because
I'm a I'm a SI but even I think there
something that's too Evil Al so imagine
the scandals from two two things he um
poked fun at lnk and also poked fun at
wom um saying the election committee had
anti-i
bias you also claim the University
president as an evil person all right so
then a fourth person comes in here which
is why I say that at least for Le like
this y'all need political parties I
actually devised my own system here uh
it would be the um wide band and Naro
bands basically wide band would be
basically they waste the money and
dedicate to
uh that dedicated to the entire school
and they abandoned to Beed something
like a key focus on one thing um so like
let's say you're in high school you need
a dance you want to dance right or the N
Band Party would use all campaign
fundraisers and all campaign time to
focus on getting one dance but they're
not going to focus on say a scavenger
hunt on Easter egg hunt or
uh adding new video projectors to the
screen right like they focus on one
thing right and then say wide band wide
band focus on other thing so maybe a
wide band dance might be like
$200 it's at the school you know have
like limited decorations and music but
wide bands also able to put out put out
uh say you know maybe have a new
projector for a room maybe put on a
special party for someone else maybe
have a more a bigger event somewhere
else as well like Easter egg hunt or
laser tank that and they band would be
like the grandest dancers of all time
right and you just vote accordingly
right if you had to hit this at G us and
that's saying that you need wideband and
Nar ban I'm saying that uh they need to
own political parties that you know
United under something maybe can have
like some a few independent candidates
right but maybe can have the gusa party
and the
GU SSR party I don't know but you you
have these different parties and then
you can all have like everyone who wants
to run come in
here uh what do they call it what are
those things called have your convention
have a nominee get nominated have
primaries whatever and you got maybe two
or three people running like an actual
election but not like random people like
this right so here we go emo into the
race uh all these people of all the
controversy coming in of course they
have their own press which is a good
thing right um emo comes in both of them
had some some experience on the USA they
worked on some clubs and advocacy groups
on campus they off Middle Ground except
it wasn't really a middle ground okay U
so they had some vague promises U which
were awful you can read them here and
they would have gotten canceled by me
from the fo like really what is this um
we're not going to read that on here all
there's one problem well Theo hadn't
filled on the proper paper paperwork and
they tried to get appealed and they
tried to have a vote to see if they have
a vote on another vote and some tearful
speeches and they got kicked out to F it
which is kind of crazy
they did not fill out their paperwork to
become a official campaign and they
failed which is funny so um they had a
zoom debate remember this is over Co I
think it's in 2021 but I guess a real
debate I guess space
something okay so LK which is the
preemptive nominees the USA Elite Bland
white bread which is crazy uh that's
what they compare them to pretty much on
brand nothing special V answer to every
question and experience by
gives man I long for the T of that
actually giving answers to vague
questions and not having to delve into
the intricacies of
um the the intricacies of creationism
versus evolution in school textbooks in
Texas as a school policy position what
like how is that a campaign position oh
my gosh uh in womb so the next
commission would gives them a punishment
so they have less questions which is
probably a good thing because they were
terrible at debating they just agreed
with their opponent or just sat in
silence for his 90 seconds and then
promised to tear up if vot on campus and
only allowing
bikes all right then the
emperor he wasn't allowed to speak so it
just like spamed the chat and then emo
also spam
uh the chat answer his question in
chat all right so
wom denied press right to interview them
they had no interest in reaching out to
the advocacy groups on
campus which like what advocacy groups
hey guys it's the
uh it's the
uh girls United how are you going to
fund us like what and they arested the
entire campaign must to end the mask
mandate on campus um and there was still
serious uh concerns about Co on campus
um especially if immuno immuno
compromised students concerns that wom
public refused to address which is crazy
like imagine running a college campaign
on weits in the masking which apparently
according to like the newspaper and not
the Reddit post they couldn't even do
like that was an administrative decision
they couldn't change if they wanted
to also they pointed out how a little
campaigning they had done no Flyers no
interviews what's I guess they can pivot
to the we're green we don't need flyers
uh campaign thing um the problem is gusa
uses rank Choice voting and the voter
turn out tends to be low so you can
swing to vote there um there's
apparently accus of election tampering
and bribery all right the accusation
made worse when a student journalist had
been impersonated by someone else I mean
this election is
crazy you got the journalist getting
hacked um
by
womb wait I'm confused false claims
against wom then publicly CED them and
discredit their criticism oh yeah so
they G make the journalist look bad wom
wom is crazy like they have their own
little super pet going they like if they
had some organization here they could be
elite
election uh inters but this is so bad at
hacking and having illegal events that
they just it's over for them I don't
even know how they still allowed to run
like if this happened at my school and
like there's this thing called waffle
gate right the kid was basically making
waffles uh he wasn't an official
candidate so he overs spent the limit uh
only official candidates can only spend
$50 regular candids can only spend $1 so
he over spent the limit um he uh broke
the handbook violations by using an
electric heating thing you can't bring
that to school all right so like yeah
and um um he
also lied to a teacher so on top of all
this he broke he broke school rules
election rules for regular candidates
and writing candidates appar yeah he got
thrown out like these people should be
thrown out election tampering
um well I guess there was no proof of
the the illegal bar thing um hacking the
journalists like what is this all right
anyway um so we have to debate
Georgetown voice ah yeah Georgetown
voice yeah that's the name of that thing
editori a WR ano for g USA exact prob
voice to as the best and only
option um which I mean they had some
policy positions that I mean at least
they positions they're bad positions but
they at least able to you know write
them out they uh destroyed LK and um
called womb unserious actively unsafe
for students I wouldn't called them
actively unsafe because like they
wouldn't be able to ban them ask M
anyway and they also wouldn't do
anything at all like they they would
have run out of money all right then
ptin Instagram account went on a rant um
he was tied of g USA the campaign
started a joke um gusa did very little
but willed significant power especially
over the budget so he just started
yelling so he said a vote for him just
wasn't a joke was State USA that they of
take and then there was a whole bunch of
side campaigns running around um and
then they had a vice presidential
debate um LK was banned W was prepared
emmo was stuck in the chat Pate time
promised to show up in a black uh
robe and um but no so then Alex day
comes uh em Mo uh for people to write
share the rules on right end if they
have a chance to
win uh the election
software they were scared that the
election software wasn't going to work
which is really funny if the voting
machines
crashed that would have been hilarious
um the election came around people cast
their ballots
and wom
won the most incompetent people of all
time literally won and the thing is they
won on less
votes and the school they even have an
electoral college grade which did you
know fun but they lost because of rank
Choice voting so LK got eliminated and
people voted for them rank room second
leaving ital 759 to
793 and they just filled in
randomly so they wanted to change the
election procedure but unfortunately for
them womb had won they investigated the
election because fraud rival you know
typical Le and stuff
and um they investigated and it said a
member of the bo campaign paid for the
nightclub candidate but none of the
candidates so they basically sick at
election Rules by having to own super
pack U by technicality they claim to be
uninvolved um and there was no evidence
to prove anything I mean these Wom
are Evil Geniuses um the election
committee stated that the election was
valid so I guess the uh they elected the
they certified the election apparently
in some schools the school senate
certifies elections which is uh crazy um
the elction like the election was valid
they were not over 10 the results um
they also pointed that wom refused to
cooperate with them which is funny and
one of the syes resigned saying that she
didn't want to deal with this drama and
left who post as a gusa
representative uh LK and mo accepted a
loss and
the uh GSA election committee Election
Commission was being paid for that work
which is nice
um I missed a think oh yes um the womb
candidates apparently uh room was
trickled in saying that Turning Point
USA TP USA
allegedly secretly funds Student
Government candidates I don't believe
that but if they do okay the like how on
Earth are you gonna fund a c a a
campaign if they don't make money like
are just gonna give them free posters or
something but their campaign was so
incompetent I don't believe that they
did that all if you guys want to hear
more about this election there's a link
here you can see the uh you can see some
of the in
posts and we got five people here we got
some of the Instagram posts
here
uh let's see what they have in
here yeah so if you guys want to check
this out you can you know start reading
about that now let's go over to uh Ava
Haru our virtual influencer a hopp is
doing really well today and uh not today
but just really well
overall a harer so we got
27544 following 244 post I would like
the r to be a little bit better but we
are doing so well I look let's look at
these Insight too it seems like reals we
are all in committed on reals I mean
look at this nonf followers basically
taking up 2 point 2,000 of our Wheels
here um so nonf followers please follow
that's 2.2k yeah um so no one cares
about post no one cares about stories
all in on
reals uh number one real for in the past
30 days in the past 90 days is this one
and it's just H saying if you have
something something because I noticed
that if say if you have then people
continue to watch and as watch time
increases maybe people follow more all
right and then here we get we made this
yesterday that's how good a harbor is uh
um 233
views 124 accounts launched and as you
can see here the fire here is actually
and you can actually notice some tin of
some smoke there the fire there is
actually from photo leap uh the mo
motion leap so uh my AI image generated
thing it had some fire then I animated
the fire on there so we can actually
check out some of these reals here so
our top content based on top five is all
reals and
I'm fine with that so let's go reals um
from Instagram our top content based on
engagement I mean let's look at this top
here 132 eight and this is from like
three weeks ago um this is from like two
days ago and this is animated least in
one of them uh like the shirt kind of
like flies backwards six that's crazy um
our most active times is for some reason
9:00 am I guess this maybe the time
people in India are most active I don't
know um uh not 9:00 am it's 900 am us
time so maybe they're going to bed and
just like checking out a wheels or
something who knows anyway so as AA
continues to go following then we will
reach out with sponsorships become micro
influencers and with this technology the
techb media now has coverage and
everything we got Tech Christianity
election school election stuff here on
the podcast and then we got I guess
Christianity influencing here and
fashion influencing Health influencing
you know anything that you know typical
20-year-old women influencers like to do
AA can also do as well as well as being
a tech influencer and digital
representative of the brand kind of like
uh what's your name for Samsung uh not
BX but they're
like Samantha something like that but um
so here the so make sure you follow us
here's the content that we are creating
so actually this is from another thing
called face tune um so I put this in
here I'm going to pause it um it's
called roast my style so I oh sorry
generated the image um and then it says
sporting a groom tube top apparently
that's what it's called um uh speaking
of what's it's been very how do you go
back oh my gosh this is awful all right
um Samsung uh Google CLE to search has
been very helpful with identifying like
fashion I'm saying images uh pictures
people because I have no idea what this
this like wait okay I'm not a go wa do I
look like Haley from down l no so uh SP
green t Toops from mid 2000s says lost
in the time whatever apparently people
like that and also I've noticed that um
people um respond better if they have
questions posed to them in reals and
comments and they will comment below so
that's good so I'm trying to avoid like
saying like some of those accounts are
like if you have under 10,000 uh like
follow unfollow follow and comment the
we done and you'll get something like
that's stupid there is engaging content
and I guess Instagram thinks that if
someone follows you then unfollows you
then follows you back again that means
you improve and I'll push you people all
right also we're making sure of add
songs to Wheels because people like
those so here we go um notice here we
got two heart here two heart here but
there are more views on this than they
are here and it's basically the same
thing as you notice her hair
is a lot faster um actually her face is
messed up there I said I put an anchor
point there um and I noticed that you
could actually speed up the time of
reals here as you oh sorry it's really
fast um no comments yet um which is
interesting and also I was able to
animate the sky here by changing the sky
so I I really like that feature in
motion Le all right it's gonna reload
again all right go this is actually
motion LEF animated so that is good and
um we always like to have Ava having
different uh as you see here we are re
reworking content so we have post here
post here post there and then we rework
it into a real and we actually got four
heart tier comments and then actually
only got two hearts here and no comment
so you can see where we're going from
here and as you can see here like this
here and it's actually an animated photo
here from Photo Pro all right uh and
they actually moved to here makeer like
bigger uh into the frame um it turned it
into a real and it did that I don't know
what that is all right
but it it's doing a great job here and
also we like to remix stuff A lot of
times um on
here so the more you miix things the
better it is for our digital AI
influencers all right let's see if there
any more
let's see does anyone have any questions
for us let's check
uh maybe we can make it a regular series
of student body election scandals and I
give tips on how to win elections um if
you guys are interested so be sure to
comment that below and let's check to
see if you have any new comments or
questions coming in oh we got to check
out our own website um the techboy also
make sure you follow a harer um big fans
big fans um uh so enabling for the
ambient wallpaper you guys know what it
is we show that last week on the podcast
and then decks needs to get better they
need to make some agreements come on
let's bring Windows to decks I want
decks on every screen or everywhere um
okay I want Dex screen Imperial
imperialism
okay
um yeah so Samsung Samsung Dex I I want
you to get some windows on you I mean I
like Android allw but I need some
windows I need some Chrome OS okay um so
please do
that
um let's see if we have any videos that
we can go over if not let's talk about t
here we go let's talk about President as
you guys know did you pay the Apple card
like I asked oh no you forgot dock the
ne
[Music]
add
okay hey Tim I was hoping that good
morning hi yes good uh I I was just
hoping that you know Siri could maybe
understand context a little bit better
well yes but you'll have to buy the new
iPhone oh uh okay so I can get it on the
15 or yes but only the pro okay wait
what only the pro is crazy but you know
just as well as I do let's see we would
work on an iPhone 11 well maybe not 11
13 most popular phone at my school so
far I'm not able to speak to her so it'd
be nice if I could just text her
directly well yes but you'll have to buy
the new iPhone oh okay yeah you know wow
guys if you want to you know type you
need a new iPhone for that I mean a16
bionic I don't know if it can handle
typing we've been been handle typing
since the 60s give me a it' also be kind
of nice if you know how we lift subjects
from photos if we could kind of get rid
of the ones in the background well yes
but you'll have to buy the new iPhone
okay that kind of makes sense uh maybe
they don't think the a16 B can handle
the computational power right okay and
uh you know could I just get some new
emojis maybe well yes but you'll have to
buy the new iPhone I'll leave you alone
well wait yes Tim don't you want to send
creepy AI generated imagery to your
friends and family uh no well yes you do
and to do that you'll have everyone
thinks AI is creepy for some I to buy
the new one all right okay I get it
wow wow is crazy there has been so much
talk in the media and online just about
Apple intelligence but I think with
annoys me I wonder how long it took them
to come up with that name and why didn't
I not come up the name and patent it
before they did or trademark and I can
just be like all Apple yeah I don't need
a million dollars and I think I might be
able to sell it to you
yeah me the most about it is it's all
about how it works and not so much what
it does I think that's the part about
Apple intelligence that doesn't really
sit right with me I'm not trying to say
that the new features aren't helpful or
handy of course being able to this
graphic is interesting to summarize an
email or get a transcript of a phone
call or generate they can transcript
phone calls now wow also they have this
um Sam not Samsung like Microsoft
co-pilot rewind feature that's on
iPhones which is interesting
um because some people scared with the
implications I would like a feature like
that on Android just I would like it to
have to be forced that every time you
use it you have to put in the password
maybe a separate password fingerprint
password and it's all encrypted it safe
like on its own separate partition and
can be wiped at the touch of button at
any
minute and it's like military CR
encryption on 512 bit okay no not not
not 256 AES I'm 512 AES great you know
disturbing imagery all of those things
are helpful and useful and I can't wait
to try them myself I do have a 15 Pro
before all of you right you're just
jealous you're not going to get these
new features no my Macbook will get all
of the new Apple intelligence features
really oh so that's why you mus want to
ban Apple products and we'll get into
that we'll get into some more as will my
iPhone but Apple typically has always
been super focused on the user
experience they never
DW going on behind the scenes whereas
with this Tech it feels like 80% of the
talk about Apple intelligence is okay
Apple has their own large language
models that run natively that makes
sense that people are that Apple saying
that because they don't they they have
to differentiate from like any random
app they can get from the App Store chat
gbt co-pilot Bing
Google okay they run on device and
nobody else is going to have access to
those but you need the certain ship to
access Apple intelligence but then if
there's something Apple Zone models are
not capable of doing that it'll ask you
specifically every single time if you
would like to ask chat GPT through a
partnership with open Ai and they're
open to adding other large language
models in I wonder if CH GPT is
allowable in musk L company future but
yes you'll be anonymous so that chat gbt
can't build out a profile on you they're
not going to store your data you don't
have to make an account with them yada
yada yada all of this crap about how
which I mean makes sense but Apple has
to be paying trp that like that data is
variable right and I know TP isible over
the we but it kind of kind of forces you
to account account account just like a
PO AI how they went through all of these
loopholes to make it safe and secure and
private doesn't matter if they're
sharing audio recordings in the
background no don't worry about that all
that matters is that they made sure that
this is the first safety focused AI but
to me it's usually the end user
experience that Apple kind of sticks the
landing on and with apple int because
lots of people have been like really fre
really freaking out about AI X NSA Chief
works for open AI open AI writes
something
bad right people just been really I'd
say over excited about AI in terms of
what it does and how it
works feels like a whole lot of software
locking and a whole lot of talk for just
some minor quality of life upgrade true
it is a lot to talk for like generative
text like
bouncy bouncy text like I'm all for
random features next right I'm a big
Android fan right I mean how many people
do you think actually use the pin that
comes out of their phone like two and
one of them is me
okay um I'm all of features like that
but actually I like to see more of this
but have you ever seen Samsung run an ad
for for that no they know that the
Samsung users are G to go on like right
but Apple users don't so Apple's gonna
have to like ad for literally every time
I Pi do another the text
do grades like am I the only one that
felt like most of the stuff they pitched
is pretty gimmicky I mean it looks cool
on paper I mean a table was nice and I
do hope this looks offline cuz I like
like most people I don't understand why
people are buying thousand laptops
thousand phones just to access the
internet and maybe like watch Disney
plus like MacBook people like oh yeah
MacBook ,000 it's a really great product
has a great it has a great camera you
know you can do video calls on here it's
basically web like any anything on $500
should be able to do videos call as well
um you know you can open lots of tabs
and Safari and um you know it's good for
typing and documents you know has lots
of storage on it $1,000 for that are you
kidding me like maybe the build quality
is better than some as Chromebook but I
mean as Chromebook or say an i5 Windows
laptop for $500 700 is a would do the
exact same thing as your MacBook Air if
all you're doing is opening say 30 tabs
in Safari or Chrome
and maybe stor some pictures no editing
of them you're just using it to like
consume content um so you know streaming
um you know open up some tabs maybe get
some light work done which like what
does light work even mean like this is
something I have like why are people
buying laptops to literally browse the
web like most of the typing is done in
Google Docs uh M Google Sheets you know
even Microsoft has online offerings of
their technology like if you're just
wondered the book that g to get you
online why are you why do you have that
like I have Windows and I don't really
use Windows programs and that that's a
shame but like I don't really have that
many programs on here maybe because I'm
out of storage space and stuff like that
but I mean we got all the we got some
forensic software blender but doesn't
really work well so you know it just
means that like the software I'm TR to
use or too high for my laptop like I
$1,000 use okay so we got $500 I don't
understand
people, for like web browsing and web
apps like they are still computers like
I still have to do research of chat TBT
and Google Gemini like what what do
people do with computers in the 70s and
80s right um how do people do like those
great changing schemes and stuff like
that what softwares that they use back
there because back in the 70s 80s and
90s most people went dialing in uh to to
the dialup connection like they had some
remote computers but you have to have a
specific modem for that you have have a
specific phone number etc etc but people
people did most of this stuff on device
so it's nice to see all the buers come
back for chance like what are you going
to do with an M1 just for M4 just for
web
browser to be able to highlight a whole
email and have it be completely
Rewritten for you but again there were
web apps and on device apps that were
already offering this it's cool that
it's native now but at least the people
I know are usually much more particular
and careful about phrasing and wording
now you got to read the whole email
twice and if you don't like it you got
to put it back and aside from that
there's also just basic things that make
Siri actually a little bit usable like
it understands the second
request okay okay okay this this vix all
right no AI updates have come to Bixby
yet I believe so may um it probably
won't be Gemini might not be chat gbt
because um Google because Apple
threatening with them so maybe it might
be you.com who
knows set an alarm oh wait no set a time
with for 10 minutes actually make that
five okay so it set a timer for 10
minutes uh so I didn't understand the
last part but it did understand the
second part but I mean it's fair because
I barely understood what that uh what
that prompt was for like I barely
understood what it's asking for that is
not human language there'll be some more
us ums likes in there best because it
remembers the context from the first one
again features that have been possible
through other voice assistance for years
and years and years and now suddenly
Apple's figured out how to do it but
they've decided that in order to access
you know texting your voice assistant or
previous context or just removing people
from the background of a photo all of
these things we want them to be done on
device even though lots of things Apple
was comfortable pulling I mean yeah lots
of not be done under device texting your
voice assistant I can do that on here I
can doent plus I can any phone has big
right
um background please
eight 7A 6A yeah they on 8 a 8 a 7A 6A
all can do that okay if a 299 phone from
Best Buy can do it your $1,000 iPhone 13
when it La should also be able to do it
pulling from the cloud before now
they've suddenly decided you know what
if we're going to do AI we need to make
it super secure and private and safe
therefore we need a large language model
that is really capable and really
functional and it only works if you have
an A7 Pro or an M chip or better I'm
sorry I just don't find let's see what
we got here A7 Pro
M1 dang kids hit hardest most think
about it all the Apple Nintendo features
that coming to this all the iPhone 15
and 13 users right there some was
probably phon at my school all got to be
hottest hit most it's crazy imagine you
you little group chat kids like to have
I was never in one not not like an
actual group chat I've heard about these
things I just never experienced them I
I'm I'm still of fun um but im a little
group chat and I'm going off with my own
imagination here as as you know s ltw is
based on real life and Imagination um so
when I'm doing chat sces like the scenes
with uh Geneva and and Clarissa those
are obviously contrived like what you
think I actually hacked their phones no
okay um those obviously made up and also
um well I guess we'll get to the part
where we bug them later that actually
did happen and we got away with it
anyway uh Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max A7 Pro
so say a17 support this y literally
iPhone 14 pro you can talking about how
the A7 is the most advanced phone trip
in the world and can do all this are you
telling me that the A7 cannot delete
something from the background you tell
me A7 cannot text Siri talk the A7 canot
do all this I mean even Samsung but AI
features to the s22 plus that would good
yeah sure is kind of slow but I mean it
still
works find many of these features that
that intensive in my op maybe the older
Intel MacBook like five years ago yeah
those probably still like who cares
about them anymore but M1 like most
people TR into M1 anyway that makes
sense but A7 no well was wrong with and
I don't see iPad on you and what I think
this iPad is not really comes down to
because again like oh there it is there
sorry okay yeah so apparently they now
have a reason to buy an M1 iPad
congratulations people you did it like
apple said they have neural engines on
chip from 2018 the neural engine is not
a
new yeah but it didn't really do
anything multi Prism support what are
you doing running an s pin here you know
what needs multi-precision support this
you know it got a it has to calculate
the XY and Z access on how this image
signal processor uh faster tessellation
and multi layer rendering that's great
it's B that's
gaming ques new concept there's all
kinds of machine learning that goes on
with smartphone photography and iPhone
photography that's been around for years
and years and years now and what I think
this all stems back to is Apple
intelligence is mainly a marketing
gimmick yeah apple itself is a marketing
gimmic iMessage is a marketing
gimmick necessarily that Apple has come
up with this breakthrough new technology
they're just continuing to add a lot of
features that would have been added
regardless of if open AI EX existed or
not it's just they found a new way to
Brand them and the more scary thing that
I'm not as big a fan of is they found a
way to software lock them by putting
them behind this Walled Garden of saying
these are like if this was an Android
thing let's say Samsung locked some of
it future did right uh you know that way
right within two months people haveen on
day in GitHub right within two months
those PES would be easy to access and
you could test them on all the devices
and see how they work right
Apple if apple and tans ends up on
GitHub github's getting sued Microsoft's
getting sued supp uploaded is getting
sued okay half the Tech Community is g
to get sued anyone who downloaded it
probably have FBI agents swatting their
house our Apple intelligence features
and only these devices support that it
really gives them more excuse than ever
to come up with software features that
are somewhat handy somewhat useful again
nothing really displayed necessarily
blew my mind of course in apple uh some
people I'm be like oh see iPhone 14
doesn't have ai so it's a good phone you
want to buy like people you're like I
want a phone that doesn't have
5G because 5G causes wildfires and covid
yeah so I want a phone that a 5G oh well
you need this like phone from theal 2019
last non 5G phone Samsung made was S10
uh not Note 10 um though some of it made
my stomach feel yeah so I I guarantee
you there will be a Market online a very
niche market but there Market Nel people
like I want an iPhone 14 pro because
look they got no AI like you know how
there's a market for phones that don't
have internet and phones that don't have
cameras and phones that like lack
features which capitalism like that's
amazing um which which is kind of
funny uh yeah there's going there's
going to be a market for phones that
don't have ai I guarantee you just like
there's a market for phones that don't
have G people good at 5G people it's
good if AI they're all going to be using
table phones and um guess more for us
feel a little weird for the most part
it's just like oh yeah these are great
you know little quality of life updates
but now you're just saying not only do
you have to check whether or not your
device has the capability to run to
check something I have an Apple device
crazy this iOS like can I run iOS 18 can
I run Mac OS Sequoia no on top of that
now there's another layer of okay can
you run the latest OS and do you have
compatibility with our internal large
language models and if you don't then
well we just came up with a bunch of
features that we can add to the latest
latest Hardware but we can leave out a
bunch of people from these new software
features which again I don't think are
that technical like it shouldn't take an
iPhone 15 Pro just to be able to type to
Siri if you want to that's crazy that's
crazy someone from a background image or
just have Siri understand a little bit
more context from earlier in the
conversation or of course just have that
really clean all the way around
animation whenever you AC I you know
some people like that old Siri Siri look
well I mean what Edge lighting too
you're selling you're selling that from
Edge Lighting in the first place but
it's a trend we've of course seen Apple
do in the past where uh
oh it's like clearly there's some
software features that they could add to
older hardware and they choose not to
because they want you to buy the newer
hardware and I don't like that Trend
I've complained about it on iPads and
Macs and stuff in the past but now
seeing them kind of double down on it
now let's talk about this one
thing one one last thing one more thing
like they say in those apple
commercials whoa that's a nice let me
get out of
here all right
um so I was listening to Dark Net
Diaries and I heard about this FBI
program
oh happy flag
day
yesterday I learned that the FBI had AI
software to analyze criminal chat
messages this is from the Nom phone
which was the criminal phone that uh
sold for criminals by criminals FBI
confiscated and then they basically use
those as man in theal devices okay so
they they use AI program to analyze
criminal chat messages and summarize
them from the an some people are just
whining about the Privacy Information of
that but I mean these people literally
bought a phone that is that's tagline is
for criminals by criminals okay they're
criminals like using the phone is
basically an indictment that you are a
criminal like it's not like just a
simple stock privacy phone like running
graph or no the people who buy those
phones are criminals to access the
website you probably have to be a
criminal
right I said uh uh this is this is if
this is true this is one of my Wilder
streams imagine FBI is a program that
can summarize messages um from thousands
of messages all coming in here is a it's
AI messages right and I said America's a
great nation God Bless America like that
that is a great software feature amazing
and and I actually would like to see
that on accient of course I don't work
for the FBI too young and I doubt to
just be screenshot circulated and
Twitter but X but yeah and of course one
last thing how do I place Google search
with gab AI I got that in the newsletter
step one don't do that and if that
enough um got</pre>
