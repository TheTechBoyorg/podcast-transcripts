<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 12525</h1>
<pre>we have so much to get to today the s25
series launched today
underwhelming the not today but this
week the s25 series launched this week
underwhelming however there might be
Hope on Horizon but companies need to
hear this message loud and clear and it
start with Samsung and it's probably
ended with Samsung as well and the s25
series
unfortunately is disgraceful I mean it's
it's terrible also we have a new
artificial intelligence sponsor hope you
guys can see this on the screen vid NOS
vids is our artificial intelligence
affiliate partner so make sure you guys
check them out and click the link in the
Channel's description and at the top of
the website this is vietn AI if you
click this link you'll get 45% off the
best AI video generator we even did some
trial runs with AA harer um speaking of
we're going to be taking a new Direction
with AA harer and not thee boy.com in
the wake of uh the
exop apocalypse anyway um this is a
disgrace to Samsung Galaxy s25 Ultra
removed Bluetooth functionality from its
s pin causing it to be a downgrade from
the Galaxy s24 Ultra that I currently
have um right here now I mean remember
around this time last year we were all
focusing on getting the s24 ultra and
how much better it's going to be over
the s22 ultra and it did improve on some
of those aspects of things but even the
s24 ultra remove features are the s23
ultra and as you guys know the S21 uh
Ultra did remove features double on the
Note 20 Ultra and the s20 ultra as well
being the well first uh Samsung
discontinued their note nine of devices
and they also removed the micr SD card
slot from devices and this is what I've
been talking about I think maybe one two
podcast episodes ago I was talking about
how companies to stop removing features
from their devices Samsung has just
removed Bluetooth from the spin that's
terrible I mean it's one of the best
features in those air addressers even
though they might have been finicky it
was something that Apple didn't have
they also had those live messages think
I think it debuted with the Galaxy Note
8 and note 9 series if I remember
correctly it's now gone Samsung used to
have action mode on some of the
older not action mode sorry sports mode
on some of the older Galaxy flagships
like the Galaxy S5 um running the tysen
skin obviously based on Android it's no
more anymore not even in the Galaxy
store they used to have a virtual camera
feature where you could take a picture
of something and then kind of scan
around it and you'd have panning uh you
could pan around the camera it's not
there anymore and is a simple software
feature that was on the Galaxy S7 Edge
speaking of the edge The Edge is back
with the Galaxy S2 Edge but no there's
no Edge screen says super super skinny
super super thin super super light
hopefully it doesn't super super Break
um and they've also remove the edge
screen from the Galaxy devices not even
including it as an option the remove
feature from the s24 ultra um from the
s23 Ultra Samsung needs to stop removing
features tech companies as a whole need
to stop removing features especially
software features now you can make an
argument for the edge not from micro SD
especially if you're going to put Ultra
in the name it's Ultra it's $1,000 it's
should be able to read micro SD card
slap
phones that are cheaper should not have
more features than phones that
cost that cost more if you go in to a s
especially the headphone check right
with the Galaxy a range of phones and
the Galaxy S old Galaxy S range of
phones right you need to keep the
features that are on the device you need
to keep the ports that are on the device
now you can make an argument that some
features like the Mini HD Mi Port that
was on like the S2 in some regions that
wasn't widespread or whatever fine you
can take that away because it's been
replaced with uh USBC that's not what
I'm saying what I'm saying is especially
software features and core features that
that you've made Adge out of and that
you've um hopped on a lot and a lot like
the headphone jack and the Galaxy Note
N9 commercials and the notch not having
a notch and having that P on camera um
in the Galaxy Note 9 and that's 10 um
commercials and you know having SD qu
which focus on having an in lot of the
chols as well bring it back bring those
features back and speaking of the notch
back I think the battles on the S9 and
the S note 9 plus note 9 um we fine and
with today's technology I think you can
get that good IA scanning face scanning
back into um the technology that's on
the devices now we have in screen
fingerprint scanners that's good but
that's not a replacement for facial
recognition technology if people if you
so choose Samsung especially needs to
bring back the features that are
software like they could do at any time
um in 2012 you used to be able to send
tap your two phones together you take
phone one you take uh phone two you tap
them you tapped them together and they'd
be able to transfer contact information
and things like that this is back in
2012 before Apple reveal name drop back
in 2023 um now you can't do that anymore
you used to be able to send fouls via
NFC like I was talking about you can't
do that anymore it was B it was B into
Android it's called Android Beam in fact
I have a phone that's like on Android 9
and it still has that feature you
updated Android 10 it's gone why why why
would they do that what what kind of
money does it cost them to keep this
software feature I mean the NFC Hardware
is still there just for contactless
payments the NFC software is free right
it's it's based off Android it does not
cost that much money leave it in leave
the features in Samsung used to be able
to have uh modules that you could
download new new different camera modes
like I was talking about the virtual
mode and the sports mode and now it's
gone and now they're moving Bluetooth
from these devices oh and there was one
more feature that that you're able to do
on uh Samsung phones let me try to
remember oh you know the Samsung Dex
they remov Linux on Dex for some reason
ridiculous why people bought those
tablets for them and now they updated to
Android 10 now it's just running basic
Android when you add a feature to a
device keep it especially if it's a
software feature so all I want to see a
return of the camera features App Store
I want to see a return of
obviously Bluetooth on Des I want to see
return of some of these Hardware
features like micro SD cards SL
headphone jack um IIs scanning I want to
see
return of some of the live messages some
of the Bixby features which we did see
we did see some new AI Bix spe powered
from Samsung unpacked so I'm excited to
get that as well but I want to see some
for some of those bxe features some of
the bxby home it's what made Samsung set
apart not just ai ai ai not just
partnering with Google for the features
that this Google pixel is still going to
get and just not kind of turning it blue
like Gemini is not a feature it's an app
okay you can download that any Android
phone
can um and J is kind of slow anyway
um but there's so many features that
we've lost like the edge
screen and so many software features
that we've lost and so many
customization features that we've lost
keep the features and if some people
like the look like some some people I
actually like the look of Samsung
Experience pack uh 9.5 this is in
between they the switch from Tyson to um
the Tyson skin not Tyson TouchWiz skin
the TouchWiz skin which was which was a
good skin people said it had too many
features I was bloed I like the features
it was good it's like the segment is
indicating let's bring back all the
touch wids features in between the
transition between touch wids and oneui
one point oh you know Samsung has
Samsung Experience those icons they're
kind of minimalistic some people didn't
like them but you know it does not cost
you money to put that icon back back in
the play store or in in the App Store G
Galaxy store it does not cost you money
to put the TouchWiz Fe features back in
the Galaxy store do it Samsung do it
separate yourself from Apple separate
yourself from Apple that's all I'm
asking good and the s25 series is now I
mean there's nothing special about it
there's nothing special about it I mean
yeah it does have some of some new
processing power capabilities and we'll
get some of the artif enti features
first you know it's running one y7 right
out of the box and we'll get what
updates in the s24 ultra but when we
when we really look down into the phone
and there there are some things that you
can look into like the the curved design
the the the edges around so no more
cutting my desk with the with s24 ultra
anymore um obviously doesn't have Micro
SD card capabilities it has 5G in it so
I mean it is upgrade but you know the
problem is with the chips what are the
new apps that you're going to use in the
chips what are what are they and of
course no one can answer those questions
no one can answer those questions and
until someone answers those questions
until someone can tell me what what
they're going to
do what are you going to get into so now
we're going to be looking at Mr who's
the boss he went hands on with the s25
ultra I'll go hands on tomorrow and get
a video out for you um and then then
speaking of Mr the boss I'm going to
talk about some common scams that people
on this side can get into and I also
have a special special announcement um
and a little bit of dialogue that we
need to get into so we're GNA try to
stay quick and on schedule and we're
going to see which of these new features
on the hands on release of the Samsung
Galaxy s25 Ultra are new which ones will
I be able to receive hopefully I'll be
able to receive some of them hopefully
there's some ex exclusive features
because you know Samsung's charging
people thousands of dollars for this
phone um if I trade it in it probably
wouldn't be thousands of dollars but
probably won't trade in whatever
um Sam samung is charging good money for
this phone we want them
to oh I don't know this is the new
Samsung Galaxy so uh also by the way
this is great editing right here
speaking of great editing hope you guys
like my new project teens ask teens of
the special project the special the tech
booy Comack project we're going to try
to start doing more man on the street
interviews like that and um K down
they're going to be more man on
interviews like that and uh hopefully we
can do more things of the
same let
me is the Galaxy s25 Ultra s25 Ultra and
honestly the moment you pick it up you
can tell that this thing is a Slicker
neater better designed phone than last
year's yeah but it's like it just took
it a saw and kind of like s saw the
edges off speaking of cell phones and
Slicker needed cell phones of course I
was right once again once again I was
right on December 12 2024 I posted um
about an impeding looming Tik Tock band
that iPhones with the Tik Tock
application pre-installed um would start
selling for 10,000 would start selling
for thousands of dollars and yesterday
Sarah Fields posted a picture of an
iPhone 12 Pro six year sorry four
yearold phone that was selling for
10,000 on Facebook Marketplace and not
to be ran an article about how um
iPhones used iPhones of Tik toac
pre-installed are going for thousands of
dollars on eBay so once again I was
right I should have bought an iPhone
should have created a Tik Tok account
but nonetheless this just goes to show
how um you know Android's just better
but but the EU should not force and iOS
to have a Level Playing Field if iOS
wants to lock down their systems iOS
wants to block applications Heck if iOS
wants to delete the app store and only
have the first party apps that they have
on the iPhone to work that's their
prerogative that's their option it's not
like there's another it's not like
there's another option we have thousand
Val Android options so the EU should
stay out of Apple's business
anyway good grief anyway
um
the iPhones as well was selling for
thousand of dollars won't work for
Android because anyone can just download
it off the internet and then run the APK
speaking of epic games you know they
baned fortnite from the uh Galaxy store
because they were mad that
Samsung uh Samsung loaded their phones
basically in Secure mode that prevents
uh third party app stores and
applications from running and let's they
disabled it's really easy to disable and
it's really sad about these activist
companies just start whining about
privacy privacy privacy blah blah blah
you know we want to have these rights
for customers Etc and they're just mad
that they couldn't get their application
in app store these ridiculous rights and
things of that nature just just end it
all okay just stop being annoying like
you're a tech company not some political
lobbyist only after spending a few hours
getting deeper that I've started to
realize this thing is next Generation in
a way that we've not really ever seen
before like the entire way that the
company is even thinking about the
smartphone is changing with the s25 so
these are the eight key things that you
need to know starting with the design
which is a pretty substantial upgrade
the s20 no it's not I mean look boom
curved edges all right that's
it all right I mean I wish the edge was
curved back into ited I wish they bring
back the curved Edge screen I've never
owned a curved
before Ultra is 15 G lighter than the
s24 ultra it's enough that's nice
doesn't really matter to me cuz I have
my 10,000 M hour battery case hopefully
the battery on the s25 ultra is better I
heard it's it's good enough for 30 hours
of video watching which is more than a
day s24 battery life here is like five
hours six hours not screen on time just
six hours of runtime which is pathetic
and terrible hopefully Samsung can get
that fixed enough to notice for sure
it's 0.4 mm thin which makes this the
thinnest Ultra phone that Samsung has
ever made it's got a stronger titanium
body thanks to a
new was the s for thinnest Ultra Pham
Samsung ever made more compacted
molecular structure and 29% tougher
gorilla glass armor two on the front
which is a pretty dicey one to test but
Samsung is saying that when they first
introduced gorilla glass armor last year
they noticed immediately that when those
new phones were coming in for repair
there was 60% less damage on average on
the screens of those thanks it still
looks terrible I mean must have been
really really bad for the phones S2 Al
and previous to this armor glass so you
know a further 29% Improvement on that
well it's not going to hurt now to be
really honest I think the colors are a
oh speaking of how do you guys like his
new studio I mean it looks nice but I
mean he spent thousands of dollars on
thaten I think it's like $200,000
doesn't look like it's $200,000 quality
I mean he could do so much more with
that screen like he he could be in any
background complete mess they're all
boring they tried to make them
interesting with the names like the hero
color is called titanium silver blue and
this one is titanium white silver let's
call a spade a spade it's gray plus they
colored the back panels but not the
sides which I think that's fine I mean
that's nice Sam you know Google used to
do two-tone designs on the Google pixel
2 Series uh just only on the backs of
course you know so can't add some
character back to the phone my phone
isn't titanium so it just makes these
all look like you know those badly
matched refurbished card do colors aside
though I was extremely happy to see that
after about 5 years of subjecting us to
a slow steady form of hand torture
Samsung has finally rounded off the
corners of their phone which nice sound
effect to as obvious as a solution as
that was does make this feel more
designed for their core demographic you
know humans but then when I properly
started using the thing I realized it's
only a half Improvement since in the
process of chopping off the corners
they've also chopped off the slightly
rounded sides of the s24 I like as
slightly round TI rest for because
especially with the 5G Ultra White Band
antennas here in your fingers you know
kind of Smash down it's good for holding
and recording video of course you know
wasn't the case so didn't really get to
do that of course Jen didn't exist for
head this one so those are now flat and
sharp to be fair to them the flatness
does give the phone a very clean
futuristic silhouette when you look from
the front but it does come at the cost
of it still not being close to as comfy
to hold as you know these more
pebble-like phones like the Google pixel
8A tell you what is very nice to see the
bezels are now even tinier 15% smaller
than the ones on the s24 ultra which is
a small Improvement but still fantastic
because it means that within this
thinner lighter less painful body we are
now also getting a slightly larger
screen it's gone from six you know I
wish we also would get a slightly larger
battery I mean we've seen some companies
do 6,000 even 7,000 Milah hour battery I
think on the Nubia red magic 7s Pro um
which has an in in display screen and
also the smaller bads as well when 18 to
6.9 nice which is good that's also nice
because it returns back to the uh s20
Ultra which had a 6.9 in display and now
with smaller bezels you know smaller
whole point
camera it's probably going to be smaller
than it and hopefully maybe we can see
the 7 in phone come 7
in and then you interact with the
software so last year with the s24 ultra
one of the most impressive things about
this phone was not actually the hardware
but more just how much Samsung had
upgraded their one UI Android skin it
felt like a complete modernization it
was prettier it was faster it was more
customizable and somehow I feel like
they've made another similarly massive
jump again this year the s25 is Will Shi
with Samsung's latest one UI 7 which
again that's not really an update it's
not really an upgrade because I have
one7 right here on my s24 ultra I had it
on it before the s25 Ultras even existed
so also I think they were running one i7
beta one like the in store store models
and I am on one7 beta 4 so I'm teching
above them and I freaking love it it
feels like this company has finally
understood that we don't want our phones
to look corporate we want them to look
bright and fun we want them to be
intuitive and most of all we want them
to look as naturally clean as possible
and they've delivered the new software
feels more visually consistent while
being functionally even more
customizable you can now do what feels
like anything you want with your widgets
your quick settings now look more
organized and again now have practically
unlimited rearrange ability and it is so
fast I never really felt like speed
issued I do miss the good lock modules
of um how you can change your app layout
you know it's it's not the best app
layout you know I like the Cur and
circle small generation but this is in a
new league Al together it screams you
get the same seven years of major
Android updates so that's all the way to
Android 22 which to be honest I don't
even want to think that far ahead and
one ui7 also plays a pretty big role in
the new AI features so I think it's
pretty fair to say that with last year's
phones s came in and they set the
Benchmark for smartphone AI the AI Suite
on this phone while of course still very
early days it stayed ahead of everything
else released in 2024 and seeing what
the S2s are able to do I would say there
is a not insignificant chance that that
Trend continues really interesting I saw
some of the presentation you know I did
a live blog of it make sure you guys to
go check that out on the tech boy.org
but I didn't really see that many
interesting AI features except for you
know the how you could combine all
images I don't think it's all great but
there is so much interesting AI stuff
here that we can actually split what
you're getting on the S2s into three
subcategories so the first is something
called cross app action which is exactly
what it sounds like it means that you
can now hold down your power button and
give your phone a command that spans two
different apps so for example when's the
next Rick asley concert add it to my
calendar and it will perform the search
online it'll I mean that's nice find the
details you're looking for it'll strip
out just the info you need and paste
that info in an intelligent way into
your Cal now the impression I get is
that this is a Google feature that will
come to other Android phones too but
yeah makes sense and also going to get S
updated to s24 prob s23 who who who even
knows the s22 series might even get it
which means there's not that much of an
upgrade you really need this feature
like a month which Samsung has done is
worked with Google to make sure that
Samsung's native applications like
Samsung Notes can also be controlled by
this now I do think this feature is
going to need work I think it's a few
years off being where it wants to be
like just for example if you look closer
here you'll realize it's actually added
a concert date to my calendar that is in
the past and even though this isn't
final software and it will get better at
launch these are exactly the kinds of
issues that you would expect to happen
when you let your apps communicate with
each other unsupervised that said once
this does get to a stage where you could
completely rely on it to
inovate invent a supervision you does
this not immediately feel like the next
obvious era of the smartphone this kind
of intelligent life companion is exactly
what these companies have been
blabbering on about for over a decade I
mean life companion was literally the
tagline of the Galaxy S4 but now look at
the features that are even missing on
today's phones from even from the S4 had
a night vision mode I played with that
um there notification LED that's gone
which um they could emulate in software
but no which I actually Ed edting places
that so I guess that's fine um they used
to have dual um front facing cameras on
the S10
just so sad now is the first time where
it might actually make sense guess
sometimes the 16th marriage is the one
wait what so the second part of this AI
equation are what I would call the
iterative upgrades so these are things
that Samsung phones could already do
that are now just better so with the S4s
there was a smart select feature that
let you tap on a part of your screen and
the phone would that they fixed smart
select I wrote an article about that I
mean it was terrible like you try to
select some text take a screenshot it
keeps tring it select it's also really
really slow I mean this phone has 12
gabes of RAM for going out loud has the
fastest you know mobile chip in the
world just be able to highlight the
thing of Interest without all the rest
of the fluff around it kind of like an
intelligent screenshot well now you have
ai select which doesn't even need you to
tap on the screen and it can also
instant convert whatever you're looking
at ready to send it to someone else like
you can tap drawing assist and I think
this is super impressive you can
reimagine that image in a different
style without even needing to mess
around with downloading it first or even
turn the video that's playing on your
screen into a gift for easier
sharability you can now generate custom
One of a Kind stickers for that's good
you know keeping up with apple and you
text people everyone's favorite
assistant Bixby now understands more
natural language I wouldn't call it a
major Leap Forward but it does build on
this idea that your phone is becoming
this assistant that you can just talk to
in a very human way and assume that
that's good I'm glad that they keep fing
BX I don't want them to get rid of
it understand what you want Circle to
search was another thing that came last
year well that can now also be used to
pick up the background music in a video
that you're watching on your phone it's
not dissimilar from what you can already
do with apps like Shazam but it's nice
to have it in one place when you're
calling some you can now record that
call you can get a full transcription of
that call in this still on my phone
again software it's really cool texting
like format and you can even search
through that entire convo to find
specific nuggets or use AI to summarize
it all I really like this one in the
browser there's a new option in which
the phone will both use AI to suiz the
page that you're on and then also read
that summary out aloud back to you again
it's not even that hard I'm pretty sure
Samsung internet had a screen reader
since like
2015 only thing is Samsung really needs
to improve their AI speech engine like
if you compare how natural chat gbt's
voice communication is compared to
Samsung's it's like a world apart and
then finally for photos the generative
editor is now a little bit faster and
quite a lot better at both removing
distractions but also just as
importantly filling in the remaining
void in a way that you can't even tell
that they were there in the first place
and then Samsung's got this feature
called Drawing assist where you make
images and this has now also been
upgraded to allow you to use any
combination of photos you've already
taken drawings with your stylus and
words to form your final output this
feature all the time hopefully maybe we
can even implement it into Ava as well
who will also be promoting Vietnam's AI
um speaking of vet's AI make sure you
guys check them out our AI partner um so
if you guys want good AI um check them
out and we're going to get paid just
going to be put into the chat below make
sure you guys go check out viet's
AI now so much happening here that no
one person is going to use all of these
AI features you might literally use one
but I'm at least happy to see that it
doesn't feel like the priority is on
just adding a ton of gimmicks for almost
all of the stuff I can see why someone
might find it useful and then the Third
third AI pillar is that the AI on the
S2s is finally personalized and this is
going to need a lot of detail testing
you know I'd like it to be a lot more
offline as well but it feels like a
pretty big step change this is the first
time that your phone is essentially able
to read anything that's happening in
your emails your reminders your browsing
history if you want it to and it's able
to use that information to more
accurately serve you so for example the
phone might have ended up seeing in one
of your emails that you have an unused
coupon that's coming up for expiry soon
and it can then send you a notification
for that or even it could go as far as
to know that you need to go to the
airport for a flight and it can tell you
that you should leave now because it
knows how far that you are from the
airport that you need to go to and that
there's been a sudden surge in traffic
the other way that this will present
itself is within the now bar which is
this new thing that you get on your lock
screen it will show you your currently
ongoing activities but also over time
summaries of things like sports games
that it knows that you'll be interested
in based on things that you have Google
searched for so whether or not the
execution is there we need to find that
do you see what I mean about the level
of thinking good here it definitely
feels Innovative as opposed to iterative
Samsung did also while announcing this
spend quite a lot of time going on about
how securely the whole thing handles
your data and it probably does but
regardless this is also definitely a
turning point in terms of how much
access you're giving to the company to
become more useful it is also having to
become more invasive and expensive
Galaxy AI is only going to be free till
the end of 2025 and so the implication
is that they will Charing a subscription
and considering how soon that's coming
pretty shocked that we still don't know
what we will be charged for and how much
it's going to cost it could be $3 a
month or it could be 20 my best guess is
that the AI tasks that are done on
device will carry on being free and then
any ones that have to access the cloud
will become paid but even if that is the
case then that still leaves most of the
best AI features locked behind a pay
wall which would also explain why
Samsung is investing so much in trying
to become a leader in the space you know
they see AI as a big part of their
future income but given that we don't
know the answers yet let's just put all
that aside for a minute what about the
hardware of the s25 ultra the stuff that
if you buy this phone you actually own
well if you had asked me what the single
best standout thing about the Samsung
Galaxy s24 Ultra was I just said hands
down the screen all Flagship phones have
had brilliant screens with crazy
brightness and high refresh rates for
ages now but the two things that have
separated Samsungs are the durability
that you get to watch TV on your phone
just improve now but also too this
anti-reflective coating that isn't
nearly as gimmicky as you might expect
it to be this coating felt like it
single-handedly cut away 50% of screen
Reflections which in turn made the
screen so much clearer than the rest and
that coating has now been upgraded again
with the s25 ultra I wouldn't say the
difference is as transformative as the
jump last year but really at this point
it's just further cementing Samsung's
display lead with also now sure
hopefully it's a bit brighter completely
new Hop 3 display technology no one's
used it before but Samsung's talking
about this like it's some kind of
Miracle compound saying that it should
dramatically increase the touch response
rate image quality and also battery
efficiency of the screen the battery
Itself by the way is still the same
5,000 Mah cell as before which is good
they're saying that thanks to all the
efficiency improvements you can expect
an extra hour of video playback per
charge compared to even last year's
phone and it makes sense that they
haven't expanded the battery given you
know hour
the thinner design the thinner bezels
and the need to also fit an S Pen inside
of here however I do also have a feeling
that this is the year where we're going
to start seeing the Baseline for phone
batteries go up significantly which
means that while Samsung was at the very
top of the battery WS leaderboard last
year I'm doubtful it's going to stay at
the top this year and on a similar note
one thing that this phone doesn't have
which honestly at this point I just find
puzzling is magnetic charging Apple has
had it since 2020 and if you are going
to Wireless charge this is just a better
way of doing it since allows you to hold
your phone up sideways and it I mean
it's fine you can get a case that does
it for you so improves the efficiency of
the wireless charging thankfully the
taas oand 360 case our sponsor actually
grants the phone that ability which
suddenly opens up a whole new landscape
of accessories I've been using this type
of taas case on my iPhone 16 Pro Max I
used it on my Samsung before that I
genuinely think that this is the best
case in the world because it's not just
that it adds magnets those magnets also
double as a kickstand as a hand grip and
basically as a way to mount your phone
onto almost anything oh yeah I just
realized Josh uses one too plus this is
the most protective that Tauros cases
have ever been there's raise protection
here for the cameras raise protection
here for the screen and all along the
inside there are now 18 air pockets for
some very extreme shock absorption link
below to find out more nice oh there is
good news on the performance front with
the s25 ultra this thing comes with 12
GB of RAM on the base model and the
Snapdragon 8 Elite 4 Galaxy you see what
this is he's showing 12 GB of RAM and
Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and you're
showing Sonic the Hedgehog which I'm
sorry you could run that in the '90s
okay this game's this game ran on a
Kindle Fire from like 2011 which is
effectively a big Power upgrade combined
with a few little extra tweaks
specifically for these s25 phones the
main thing though is just the Snapdragon
8 Elite is enough of a jump from last
year 30 to 40% depending on how you're
measuring it that it's kind of like
moving up a whole new tier like this is
the point where Android is back on track
and in a lot of ways now actually ahead
of Apple's performance been a long time
since that was the case the one thing to
watch out for is just that some early
devices that have had this Chip have had
thermal issues which is probably why at
the same time Samsung has fitted this
phone with a 40% larger Vapor chamber
and a new thermal interface material for
faster heat dissipation whether or not
that saves it we'll have to wait for the
full review but then as well as that
core performance perk Samsung has also
been working with the chip maker to add
in two extra features the pro scaler
which uses AI to basic Bally upgrade any
content that you watch on your screen
like if something's really look like
it's a bit brighter I mean look at look
at the tree it just looks a bit brighter
you
know maybe a bit enhanced but that's it
low resolution your chip will apparently
notice and figure out how to upscale it
without you even needing to think about
it it's similar Tech to what Samsung's
8K TVs use although I would be lying if
I said I could actually notice the
difference in person but then also the
camera the chip is also supposedly tuned
to specifically improve the low light
performance in Samsung's phone which big
if true but I will only believe it when
I see it speaking of which though good
to see that Samsung hasn't completely
forgotten about cameras amidst all the
AI hoo-ha so the most obvious change is
the 12 megapix Ultra wide has finally
become a 50 megapixel ult that's that's
going to be great that's going to be
great it's going to have more
features absorb my light I have to test
it out in store that's a good good
improv now they are about 3 years behind
a lot of other phones and getting there
but this is great news cuz the ultra
wide was always the ugly duckling of
Samsung's camera system and it's now
being upgraded not just improves the
ultra wide shots but there's also a
dramatic resolution bump to close-up
macro shots since it uses the same
camera and then at least based on what
Samsung is saying the even bigger camera
changes are the things that you can't
see so their underlying software the pro
visual engine has been upgraded which
they saying means significantly faster
shoot and also better quality that's
good that's good hope he doesn't lag in
important situations and smoother Zoom
Shots by inserting extra frames in
between the animation and the smoother
aspect I can attest to the better aspect
is not as clear to me like on one hand
this is a photo taken at 30 time zoom
and I can absolutely see the Improvement
in texture and detail on this year's
phone versus last year's but then cter
example I took this shot at 10 time zoom
and maybe because this is a face and
it's harder for AI to understand faces
as opposed to surfaces but here I
wouldn't say it's really better at all
there's a new AI image signal processor
specifically designed to improve selfies
there's best face which means that if
you keep the motion photo feature on
then anytime after you've taken a shot
you can go back and both instantly make
it either a boomerang or a slow motion
clip which is nice but also use on
device AI to comb through and pick the
best face it can from all the face
options not a feature that we've that's
good you know we've seen Google do that
hopefully you can do that also on the B
Camas as well never seen before but I
was surprised just how much this can
rescue a otherwise lost image Samsung's
also saying that they've specifically
worked with social medias like Snapchat
and Instagram to uplift the quality of
footage taken within those apps but I
also feel like they say the same thing
every year and I'm never really
particularly impressed this phone has
the company's first everever spatial
temporal filter which basically allows
the phone to distinguish between moving
and stationary objects when you're
shooting video so that it can treat them
differently it means that the phone can
focus on making sure that moving objects
don't look blurry while also making sure
that static objects don't look grainy it
is spot-on exactly the thing that
Samsung's camera needs to focus on we
just don't know yet if it's enough of an
improvement to actually fix it and then
to add to that the sound quality of your
videos might well be improving too
thanks to a new audio eraser feature
which I'm excited for the uh s25 Ultra
versus iPhone 16 Pro Max uh comparison
CA comparison I think Samsung might come
out and win this one not dissimilar from
what we've already seen Google pixel
phones do for a while now but basically
it means that the phone will pick up all
the different types of noise in a video
that you shoot for example wind noise or
room noise and it allows you to adjust
the levels of them and then the sprinkle
on top is a bunch of new Pro features
like 10 bit HDR video recording which
has four times the dynamic range but
then at the same time I kind of hate it
because it just makes your screen
unnecessarily bright when you watch it
and things like log recording which
gives you ultimate color flexibility for
editing afterwards so I would say not
one of the biggest on paper camera
upgrades but then if they do pull off
all the software Wizardry that they're
saying they will it could still become
one of the most meaningful ones and
that's the s25 ultra mostly great I
that's s25 Ultra for you guys now let's
get into the top scams now as you guys
remember M deoss did go over this before
but there's this phone called a patriot
phone or something like that and these
these all these alt tech companies and
you know the problem with alltech is
that sometimes the technology that's in
them is not as good as the competitive
Technologies something like you know gab
or getter or truth social compared to
Twitter or Facebook or Instagram
whatever it's just not as good so there
these phones out there that can
have uh I I think it was called like the
Patriot phone something like that right
it was based off of um a Android based
Chinese phone
that you can get like one of those not
not not like as bad as a wish.com phone
it was like a mass-produced phone that
cost like $160 in real life they were
selling it for f $500 saying it had some
type of special secure Communications
application it was just an APK that they
installed on the phone preinstall and
they were charging people about two and
a half times more than the regular price
completely unacceptable all right so
that's one scam there so if you are
seeing an ALT Tech company on alt alt
tech phone make sure you guys go check
it out make sure what
is that that is legitimate go look at
the specs right it be really easy to
tell if it's actually worth $500 or if
it's worth $160 and they're just
scamming you based on import prices from
China now another scam that's also going
around here and there's those stupid
bracelets and stickers
and like wall pieces and we've gone over
this multiple times before but okay
let's let's make this extremely simple
for you right one your cell phone
radiation is not affecting your brain or
or your ear or your eyes or whatever
okay that's that's that's number one
number two um let's say hypothetically
for the sake of argument that it is
putting a sticker on the back of it
would not work because if the stickers
do what they claim to do that it BL that
blacks out so-called bad radiation this
radiation that's less powerful than the
radiation that comes from the Sun but I
digress then your phone wouldn't work
because it wouldn't be able to get any
signals those stickers are scammed and
they have got to be the greatest scam of
all time okay so like you know those
like the stuffed animals that they were
selling and the little uh the little
ambulet and necklaces and stuff like
that sure they can sell those for $200
but you know you actually have to
manufacture those you know the made out
of met on or something like that those
stickers you can get probably like a
pack of 100 stickers from the dollar
store for a dollar eight cents here in
Taxas right so let's just say a dollar
which means each sticker right it would
be a dollar $1 divided by 00 each
sticker would be about a
penny would be about a penny so imagine
you sell a six pack of these EMF
stickers for $50 that's what they
actually sell them for um EMF blocking
stickers
EMF and and people over here on this
side ACH is selling them for 90 $90
$90 you know here's a carbon EMF
harmonizer three pack sticker from um
life Harmony enery
wow they have generic ones on Amazon for
$12 wow what a deal $40 up here anyway
and people over here in like this alt
Tech space um Can can sometimes be so
gtable and believing ridiculous
conspiracy theories I hate conspiracy
theories but um because because they
they lead to stuff like this like oh my
goodness there's radiation coming out of
and then anyway I mean let's break down
the scam for let's say let's say you had
this $90 it's 30% off right away wow you
can get a sticker from the dollar store
100 pack for
$1 right you can get these stickers for
$240 here this is do these stickers
because it comes in a three pack right
that makes each sticker worth let's go
let's do 240 240 divided by three makes
each sticker worth $80 $80 for one
sticker you can get a 100 pack of
stickers from uh the dollar store for uh
$1 which means the sticker there is
worth one one cent so divide that by
0 one these people are upselling you a
Lal sticker right with the logo into or
whatever but because because they can
Mass produce and they can produce this
for like a penny for
eight
8,000% I mean this has got to be the
greatest scam of all time you get these
people right who have this kind of tiny
tiny colal of Truth not not even that
much of a Cel TR it's debated right get
people who believe this you get them all
to come together and they they they get
deluded into believing that it's hurting
them and then you put the stick on the
back of the phone they fall for like
some type of fake study and you charge
them eight 880,000 per for a sticker I I
could go into the sticker business right
now uh you know I can buy a sticker I
can put stamp my logo on it boom maybe
maybe sell them for $5 and say it's
gonna block radiation rays and
um I mean you can prove it doesn't work
and you can easily prove those stickers
don't work but these companies are still
in business I mean they paid for Google
app
$40 here 50 $59 for one
sticker here's one
here one sticker for
$59 like do do people actually think
that this thing works I'm I'm sorry but
my computer here has an Intel Evo i7
sticker that's right there do you do you
guys actually think that this
works like
no all right let's say
hypothetically look how skinny that
thing is you think that skinny thing can
I don't even know how especially for the
laptop it would block radiation like
what you don't think radiation could
come from oh I don't know the screen the
keyboard oh but this sticker yeah it's
protecting me that that
tiny finger thumbnail siiz
sticker here it is on the back of a
phone
look how is this not even shut down and
let's look at the quote key benefits
Safeguard your help from EMF radiation
emitted by V wires device I don't know
how uh you know this one sticker can
just like this kid this kid is using a
tablet with the case on it that case is
doing a lot more to block quote unquote
radiation than your
sticker it has adhesive backing better
than a blocker it is not alter a blocked
R signal so your device continues to
operate normally I can tell you why it
operates normally because because you
put a sticker on your device putting a
sticker on something most likely means
to still going to work and you get these
fake people here
refuse and and we even went over this I
think some guy named Russell or whatever
was trying to sell some amulet right the
amulet website they said they had some
studies those studies were based on
Shopify and those are the only data that
they were basing it off
of and it it it it's honestly sad and
ridiculous and pathetic so uh guys don't
buy those stickers another common it's
not really a scam but thing that I
probably wouldn't get into
is uh crypto I'm I'm not gonna be
launching a coin anytime soon
like there's this fine line between scam
and not scam and all that like what what
you basing this off of also Tuttle twins
would you shut up when a country goes to
war something something something
something like well you guys are
obsessed with Bitcoin for some reason
tble twins like you you literally
created a coin of some dancing Bitcoin
and had whole song about how good it
is okay
sure anyway um speaking of uh alt Tech
and social media and things of that
nature of most Reddit communities
because they're stupid have banned
xlinks
which like that's all that's on Reddit
like you go when you go to front Frid
red is like people just reposting xink
what's going to be there anymore
literally nothing and reddit's going to
die a sad slow painful death and that's
gonna be unfortunate because R you know
it's sucessful of internet but it did
contain good information anyway as the
tech boy always likes to you know as we
always say don't let the good
controversy go go to way his controversy
drives click our new social site not the
boy.com as you guys know which was
intended to compete with not the.com um
is now switching away from the Christian
edtech social media um social media uh
landscape here hope you guys can see
this on the screen but not the boy right
now it's free we are going to be
unveiling our new Reddit obviously it
allows ex link
because my goodness uh obviously it it
um allows links um so we're going to
have our own little groups and subredit
here they're going to be called groups
we might even changes to be read but of
course we have our ssw group this for
the book and the website which we'll get
to that later then we have funny because
that was apparently the number one
Reddit community and then we're also
gonna have sports sports hereo so um we
can talk about sports got the AFC
Championship gam coming up the Rockets
play tonight in Cleveland hopefully the
Rockets win so and also hopefully the
Chiefs speak the bills like you know
Texans lost to the Chiefs unfortunately
so hopefully the Texans didn't lose in
Vin and the Chiefs can three Super Bowl
anyway discuss it all on notthe boy.com
it's free um you can access that at
social. thech boy.org also if you want
to access any of the techboy ofs media
properties it's media. the techboy uh no
sorry site. thech boy.org site. the
techboy org guys make sure you check
that out so this is our Reddit
alternative we're unveiling it here call
not the boy we're getting more people on
here we've seen extreme amounts of
growth come to here and to the site as
well so we're going to be getting into
more of these things as well um we have
more projects um coming out as well so
you know teens ask teens um hopefully we
can continue that project um or redit
alternative not the boy of course we're
going to be continuing that as well it
only cost me $50 off a discount when
more people come in it's going to cost
more money but hopefully you know we can
get some more ad reue some add traffic
to drive traffic to the site all
right um speaking of X you know X has
this really really weird thing of like
you know it it's not YouTube Right
YouTube is the video posting site but
for some
reason it like you have all these people
especially verified accounts and um
accounts that kind of push uh uh almost
said the name accidentally kind of push
gambling applications like uh I guess I
can say it's not like anyone's listening
to a stake whatever and they'll show
some like viral video and for some
reason especially this is the problem
with like lot lots of websites like
twitching uh which honestly that is the
greatest business model all time
especially twitching think about
twitching twit gets like millions and
millions of views every day they hire
thousands I don't know thousands but
like lot lots and lots of writers who
can come in of course they can REM work
remotely they find posts on X that they
didn't
write they they find them they embed
them then they go Ed other people's
replies on them and then they'll go um
you know have like maybe two three
sentences of commentary and they put
some ads up on the site and they
actually make money greatest business
idea of all time well Al also as you
know not B does that sometimes Red State
who also works with Twitchy with Twitchy
also does that sometimes also some other
websites like I think uh bleach report
Etc does that for sports you know the
NFL likes to take clips and post them
over there so for some reason this
became the platform for short from
horizontal video not not too much
vertical that would be Tik Tok or IP or
IP and
um I really find it to be really
interesting for like all these stupid I
don't even know what they come from
stupid vial videos um like from internet
Hall of Fame that that'd be good that's
a good account here um they just find
these videos and sometimes they just
embedded Tik toks or Instagrams I'm like
what first of all a who was filming this
B where are these videos even coming
from and see why how do they even make
it here and they're actually making
money out this and when you even go and
see on these threads which um it's not
normal engagement it's not like oh wow
that's an interesting video wow that's
neat and some of the videos are super
stupid we're going to show you one of
them here um you can see some of these
videos here
um oh yeah there's Beast games um you
know clips that they don't even own like
Beast games they don't own Beast games
Beast games s tent I'm so glad that 972
that annoying woman got out like stop
whining about reism and stop saying that
God is on your
side no shut up okay you're
annoying like go go sit go go sit down
go home please stop you yapping she she
annoy for all seven seasons episodes
anyway you find all these clips like who
who is taping
this first of all hey who
even like what who who was taping
This and like where they even finding
why are they even finding these clips
and he's actually making money off of
this and when you go into the priz it's
just other people posting random
videos like it's and it's always
sometime some of the same content like
you know like I I criticize Snapchat as
a vertical video application by saying
it was just fooled of that fat woman
running around the mall and a whole
bunch
of trash video platforms and whole bunch
of you know scams like oh hey guys you
want to go see pictures if your crushes
and it's like some random lady that they
took from Instagram who's over dancing
you know I don't I don't understand how
it's a trend but it is you know some
random lady overall Instagram dancing
then they get some fake female voice and
overlay some text of course we've talked
about the scam multiple times I mean of
course you know it's probably not
scamming anyone because a it's terrible
when it leads to a broken website so I
don't even know how it could scam you B
um like literally no one watches those
because they're so bad quality like the
only good thing on there is you know
those texting
videos and
see well you know like I said no no
one's watching them no one's going to
click on them and it's probably not even
the SC I think the wor scam on the
internet those stupid stickers because
they're extorting you for 800,000 based
on totally madeup science and they they
totally verified up there on Google and
Google ads you know I should take them
down we should take down those sticker
companies like and even if they happen
worked like those are so
overpriced those are so
overpriced and um yeah so the but let me
let's look at these videos like here
here's one this is some guy on the
escalator carrying a PS5 in the mall
first of all for all these people who
record videos in malls and
like where like how do you have time to
do I don't want to get whatever
like
what so this guy's carrying a um PS5 and
the other guy was carrying
a coffee
maker and um that that's the clip and
it's posted around here m like what how
first of all how did this become the
spot for video and
B why is it this kind of video like I I
get Sports I I don't really get sports
but like it's always these like clips
excerts from from Tik toks Instagrams
and things of that nature here's another
one stupid one uh oh yeah it's from
crazy moments here we
go crazy moments was replying to a video
like they were replying to a video with
the video of course this one of the
dumbest videos I've
seen uh it's someone talking so we'll
keep it first of all I don't even know
why it's in black and white like did
they record stuff of dasham but
whatever here we go uh and since it's
talking and not here we go yeah can I
see your phone I'm about to go to your
what Instagram and Snapchat and stuff
like
that are you insane are you seven
would not no no look hey can I like we
talked about this problem before I
believe like this one lady was going
around campaigning and she was like can
I see your Instagram and she's actually
signing them up for campaign
emails
boom
but if you want the password like I
didn't come up with the good password
for
nothing I didn't just come up to like
hand it out you know I didn't sit there
thinking about it you know generating it
in that app I told you guys about go go
check password generator uh I might put
the link down below I didn't come with a
good password for nothing like you're G
have to work I'm just hand no see this
this is why have secure
folder insane insane in freaking s oh
that's fine I don't care you can go
through everything you want you got my
password you got which that's even worse
like
imagine like I'm glad this is in high
school I hope this is in high school
which I mean like I said High School
dating is like the meme coin of the
internet of the of the real life like
you know Meme coins you know the fake
coins they're aren't based on anything
like I don't I don't even understand
what Bitcoin is based off of but
whatever um
anyway the fake coins that are based off
of everything based off of
hype like I I saying team dating is the
meme coin
of of real life it's so meme coins these
fake coins whatever you know based off
of some popular celebrity or something
you go up they pump it up they're
popular so people are interested in them
just because they're
popular and
then you know it's all hype just like
Teenage dating this is even what Chad
gbt told me like a teenage dating is
just based off of hype because there
there's no end goal there's no end goal
of meme coins it's kind of you want to
make money you gota jump in jump out not
Financial advice but you got to jump in
jump out before it you know inevitably
crashes
because it's it's not based off anything
like it's wasting a fiat currency then
you you know for I guess dating and like
it's based off of hype oh look I'm doing
I'm doing it I'm doing I'm doing so you
gotta invest you gotta invest you gotta
invest and then it cres and Bs and then
you move on to the next person kind like
that kid Sean and boy me 12 who uh for
some reason he's been on like 50 days
which is like insane like if I had a
dollar I could like buy the entire TV
series right so you think about me
points based on hype dating based on
hype based on nothing and nothing cres B
uh imagine if this happens like he has
to a password like they's say to break
up oh well now they can I mean he can
computer hack her but I mean it's not
even hacking because she voluntarily
gave him her password which is just
ridiculous like imagine giving your
password to some random guy you're not
even married to this guy and first of
all who was filming this again who was
filming this and uploaded it to the
internet and if she what is she getting
out of this what is he getting out of
this got everything that you need I
don't need my phone I got whatever I
need in front of me and which is you
so okay I'm not going to be pinching it
here but what's in front of her is the
car and if this is in the United States
probably not doing because I thinks
she's on the passenger side you don't
care if I check your phone I don't care
you can do whatever you want with it oh
famous last words what if he oh I don't
know then this is this hypothetical here
then this could be a skit because you
know it's it is on tape I don't know why
it's said black and white
but I don't know maybe could I don't
know commit a crime blow up someone's
vest you know by sending a
text put stuff on the phone that's not
supposed to be there then implicate you
and you're gonna have no one to blame
but yourself because you gave him your
passwords
what so what happens if somebody takes
you you can block them I don't
care does this woman not believe in
blinking by the way anyway I don't know
how whatever you can hear this woman y
on and on and on and on about stuff like
that anyway the document unfortunately
we weren't able to get it out yesterday
uh for for the anniversary of ssw the
Spy Chase but as you guys want uh some
some Rising summer is rising we're
releasing a new episode article yeah

um oh one more thing before we leave I
was watching this movie and this kid was
getting out of her Mercedes I don't know
why she had a Mercedes but whatever and
all the kids like kind of looked at her
you know like like wow and they kind of
all like waved and no she got out and
waved like she was like president or
something they all kind of looked at her
and she was like walking by all the kids
like impressed with feel for some reason
I don't know why from like 2004
so yeah know that's just interesting
things that did not happen uh I guess it
happened in my head but didn't happen in
my life but it did happen in that movie
from before I was born
so that's interesting all right God
bless Tech talk to L and hopefully
