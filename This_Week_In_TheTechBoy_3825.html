great hello everybody and welcome to
this weekend the tech boy podcast we
have so much to talk to you about today
I just want to make sure one thing that
the audio of my video is coming
through this the regular software didn't
decide to
work right
test anyway this is being used on a
software called VX so we can get um
ready for everything that's happening
today but I can do this neat and fun
transition boom all right there it is
that's our fun transition for today
using a software called vmx I'm glad
that you all can see everything that um
is being shown all right we have so much
to talk about today um I have my list up
right here we're going to be talking
about this new internet Trend we're
going to be talking about some videos
some 2000 PC programs I am now the
number one search result on Google when
you talk about that and of course let's
talk about about tech.org
and once again some 2000s computer
programs and um the Apple MacBook inf4
released so without further Ado um and I
know how the people from that podcast
hate that let's get to um my favorite
website the tech boy.org to see what
tech twins are in for us
today all right so this is
this I thought I made it
yeah okay anyway this is the tech
boy.org
and this is of course the website that
we use hope you guys can see this on the
screen Samsung Galaxy released the
Samsung Galaxy A50 um series of devices
and
um yeah so this is the Galaxy a56 A36
and a26 5G and you may be wondering how
do you what what do you mean this is the
a56 a26 and a uh 6 5G yeah they're all
the same size they all have the same uh
you know
specting like that so you know I I'm not
really sure how wait you can't see let
go go back to where you
belong there we go all I'm not really
sure how how thises is supposed to
differentiate itself from anyone or
stand out stand out from the crowd in
fact I'm going to bring up
the Samsung
Newsroom uh announcement as it as it
goes through here you guys can go
through the article itself here's the
Samsung Newsroom announcement that I got
this from so I got these from uh you
know artificial intelligence sub summary
um of I was going to sit here and right
an entire article Ying about you know a
super basic phone like yes that's my job
but whatever anyway this is the Galaxy
a56 a26 and a26 5G anyway right I'm just
checking through the camera here oh I'm
going to school to here you guys can go
read this through for yourselves if you
want it's so small there we go here the
specs yes guys look the entire display
is 6.7 in for the 856 836 and a826 they
all have the same exact display and it's
a good display too 120 HZ which means
it's better than the iPhone 16e heck
even the iPhone 16 and 16 plus uh it has
Vision boost too and they're all the
same size me it's also bigger than all
those phones as well except for the
iPhone 6 16 plus I think they might be
the same size as well only the iPhone 16
Pro Max is bigger than it at 6.9 in now
when you have the same dimensions in
weight essentially look uh yes the 856
5G
is7 I
guess millimeters uh longer smaller cuz
I guess they you to have marginally
smaller bezels it's covered a26 wow
we're a chunka here 162 versus 164 so
yeah other than the bezels the simp the
same size and weight um only the a26 is
heavier than A36 because of the extra
bezel that has there I don't know why
the 856 is an extra three gr uh and
since this is America G do this in
Freedom Units D grams
to pounds absolutely nothing I said have
done ounces
ounces yeah so three oun so it's an
extra 0.1 of an ounce guys so uh
yeah that's it all right now let's look
at the camera specifications hereo again
it's not much to be uh to be talking
about like a 12 megapixel versus 8
megapixel Ultra wide camera Ultra wide
camera are trash anyway um 50 megapixel
main camera uh same uh f- stop at one
1.8 they all have the same 5 megapixel
marocco camera except for the cheapest
version of it and actually you see that
the front camera is 13 megapixels on the
a26 but 12 megapixels on the other ones
which means the center size is just
better on the uh these phones right here
but post for that that's essing the same
thing now there is a processor and I did
go to the processor and I did do
versus.com went to versus.com to check
out the processor
and the A36 and I assume the a26 as well
is using the Snapdragon 6 gen 3 mobile
platform now the Snapdragon 6 gen 3
mobile platform uh it's a decent ship
you know
um and the a56 5G is using the Samsung's
own in-house xnos um chip I looked it up
on fis.com according to vas.com
um the xnos chip is better so let me get
those statistics up there for you guys
um but that that's really interesting
like the cheaper phones get the snaptag
and also I mean there's literally
nothing to talk about for those phones I
mean sure the design is decent they have
decent cameras um
but
Snapdragon
6
gen three but I mean they they they all
essentially 12 and copies of each other
I mean they're all the same I I was
going to look at the phone unless is a26
compared to say the a 56 I be like how
am I supposed to know what the
differences are um in in in this phone
just from looking at it usually you can
do that I mean usually with these phones
especially with like the 20s and the 10
and stuff like that you can tell cuz
like one of them's going to have like a
chin one of them is going to have like a
U-shaped notch or Etc with this it's
going to be the exact same phone here
and the Samsung xnos 1580 is barely
better it's barely better than the
uh chip that they put onto the phone
here hope you guys can see let's see
what transition we're going to
do fly there we go here's the Qualcomm
uh Snapdragon versus the uh Samsung
Galaxy's own in-house EXO 69 versus 61
sounds like a a college basketball game
going there oh this March m in the
season um starting let's look at this
look what makes X better so it is 10%
faster for all you Gamers out there uh
who value that 10% speed increase uh
espe but if you are a gamer then you
probably going to be playing a lot
better games than
uh than whatever these phones can handle
all right and it has a faster Ram speed
I always always always when I go look
for a phone I always compare the ram
speeds between each other and I know
that people buying lowc cost phones as
well will also be looking into the ram
speeds of the um phones all right now
this is this is actually a useful
Improvement almost two times fast to
download speeds that's actually very
useful okay um yes yes let's talk about
that all right and
um a better GPU clock speed again for
the uh Speed Demon Gamers out there uh
hmp which is
heterog heterogeneous multiprocessing
which is a more advanced version of the
big little technology as everyone knows
all right and it has more memory band
ripped and uses multithreading all right
now let's go over to the qualum
Snapdragon 6G Dre and see what the
benefits of this is fast
uploads so uh that's it so if you want
the faster phone by 10% and two times
faster downloads go with Samsung Galaxy
xnos 1580 but if you want fast uploads
go with the uh a20 6 and A36 series of
devices so um that that that's
interesting uh right there so let's
let's check to see if we have any
comments that have come in to tell me
what they think about of these phones
all right um but that that's not all
we've come to talk about on the tech
boy.org um of course the best website on
the internet speaking of the internet
and oh wow we got uh David JY saying
he'd never wear a hat like that cuz he
could
uh carry it off well uh this is you know
this is America and I have my America
hat on uh today well I I would just had
almost every video from now on it's like
my trademark it's like my trademark uh
thing so
unfortunately it it do not want to show
comments on screen so I'm going to have
to
just say that you YouTube didn't want to
log
in so I'm going to have to log out from
YouTube to log back into YouTube oh wait
no no you only get the you didn't see
that did you let me check no you you
can't see this no okay yeah you guys
didn't see that good good good you know
if you see if you see this you guys will
be trying to be hacking into website we
can't have any of
that yes yes yes you can manage my
YouTube
account all right great so I've logged
in great all right now I'm going to
import my comments I think it's called
social QRS
no no it does not
let's see how do you import comments
[Music]
here oh I'm got to use this stupid link
okay here's the vmix social browser
all right well if we ever get another
comment I can show it to you guys on the
screen but thank you David for your uh
comment who said he couldn't uh pull off
a hat like this all right so let me show
you guys to a screen that we can talk
about anyway this is the Galaxy a56 5G
series of devices it's a it's an
interesting series of devices and I'm
pretty sure that they're going to sell
well you know cuz um the a series of
devices and you know those series of
devices will sell well and another
interesting thing is that they do have
Samsung Galaxy AI enabled on them and
also Samsung Galaxy 1ui 7 before users
of the uh s24 Ultras officially got
their One ui7 updates now speaking of
updates you may be wondering why am I
using this weird background behind me um
this background being the windows this
the
uh uh wallpaper and that is because
today we're going to be talking about um
old software in fact if you go into
Google right now and search um actually
we can do this we can do this live um if
if you go into Google right now and you
search that's a nice transition right
there
um what software that TG Us in the early
2000s the number one search result after
you see this I AI thing here which is
actually based off of the one day ago
post that happened on Reddit um as you
all know things don't just happen things
don't just you know post into uh
existence sry redeemed Zumer anyway here
is software what software did team use
in the early 2000s I made this thread
and somehow I went viral without anyone
anyone actually insulting my
intelligence or yelling at me I know I
know it's it's it's like a miracle that
uh I I actually went viral on Reddit
without someone uh yelling at me I mean
it's that's unprecedented right there
all right anyway we have over
4,000 sorry 400 comments on here and
100,000 views right now on The View
counter is at
1,00 121,000 views I assure you I can
read and um unfortunately I haven't
gotten through all the comments see I
already have seven unre messages here as
well but I'm just going to go through
some of the top ons I actually
downloaded some of the top ones a few
hours ago while preparing through this
and we're going to talk about what
softwares the teens use to
uh uh you know do
stuff uh you know back in the early
2000s which was in the era
of uh time
that whoops which was an ER of
time that um I forgot that this isn't
like the other software where I can go
off and try to
um do stuff so um which was an era of
time that uh you know everything might
have been a bit more offline so I'm
going to go find my grock
chat let's see
gr and this it will pull up all the
software mentions in here I actually got
accused of being a felon because of this
you know and we'll talk about this when
we get to the SS ltw segment of um H
is was was asking me about
um zoe1 where the boys are using a spy
um Tool uh accessing with their
computers um to spy on the girls um so I
was just wondering if any of the other
rators did something of the same they
didn't IDE did and a family that's F in
but Texas is a one party state so what I
did was totally legal um and you guys
can go read about that in SSI ltw not
yet but it's it's coming up soon anyway
so here are going to be some of the top
softwares and I had gr categorized them
um for you guys um but one of them is
incarta and I do like that we're
starting off strong with incarta I
actually downloaded incarta on my system
I'm going I'm thinking I have like this
virtual desktop here um it has the
Vista uh
screen saver and I know you guys can't
see this and I downloaded some of the
software now some of the software I
didn't download you know I don't know
where it's been um I just downloaded the
little icons and I'm going to make a
video about them so right now we got
Winn which is apparently a media player
we got aim which doesn't work anymore so
we got the video there uh icq another
picture aaza which is a chatting
application I believe lime W I don't
want to go to jail so there's a picture
of that in DC Plus+ which is apparently
a uh
sharing program they lots of the
programs apparently that they say that
teens were using and I believed them not
can go back in time and fact check them
if I could go back in time I wouldn't
waste it on traveling to some R's house
um oh wow we already have almost 700
comments now um anyway so yeah some of
these comments most of the comments
actually were talking about software
that was just used to transfer other
things so a lots of peer to peer uh
clients well but the top comment here is
uh in all right and then he this guy
nicely switched him out so for a was
huge everyone was talking about a and
MSN Messenger we'll talk about MSN later
on the show and then internet explor
Firefox and opa um weirdly enough
they're talking about that now here's
another thing Adobe software they were
talking about
Photoshop uh Photoshop people really
really loved Photoshop uh as well um
Winamp lime WI um and I downloaded when
when we can probably display it for you
guys as well if I can get the inputs to
work um
correctly all right and I know it may
not look like I responded to all the
comments but I really did try to so if
any of the rors are watching right now
I'm hopefully you guys can uh thank you
and if I didn't respond to your comment
I guess leave a comment so I can tell
you all right speaking of comments I'm
going to go check them so let's stop
sharing the screen um for
now all right um and also I'm going to
pull up my my list I downloaded the
comments where actually when was at 400
and they can tell me what some of the
most popular things were I had AI ranked
them for me so it was very very
useful um tool there all
right let's so oh I'm supposed to be
checking for comments
no
no no all right no comments yet all
right
um anyway so here is
grock here is so it's it's giving us a
summary of what the software was used in
the early 2000 I think this really
interesting because of course back then
internet speech were not as good so
stuff would have had to work offline of
course processing power wasn't as good
as it was now so of course we would have
to work you know
uh faster um lot you know people just
have to be a bit more patient and I
think one of the interesting things is
that you know we've already can do and
accomplish things with computers it's
not like we're going to be um opening up
any new groundbreaking discoveries uh
what do you guys think do you think
we're going to open up any new
groundbreaking discoveries like we got
you know chat gbt and people just using
it for stupid stuff
um are we going to have any anything new
in the next 5 years that's you know
genuine genuinely useful and I'm going
to say genuinely useful which kind of
excludes video games so yes we always
need more processing power to run you
know holographic worlds and video games
and Etc but anything actually useful or
maybe fun but I guess then we'd have to
re include video games so I think that
in fact this computer like I'm running a
streaming service offer and it looks
like it's running fine only using about
F 5% CPU um you know my phone perfectly
fine for what we needed to do I'm pretty
sure even those a56 is might be
perfectly fine for what need to do
except when I have to edit video um
which I do not do on my computer but you
know it's just I haven't found a good
edit my computer sometimes slow even
though it's good which I kind of
disapproves the point of like do we
really need any more computing power um
all those computers that are coming out
we all know we all know um what the
those computers are being used for and I
guess we can make this as another point
after we get through the 2000 software
so let's let's let's get to that all
right let's do oh okay that's a nice uh
transition D um anyway so here's what it
had uh the number one thing that people
would saying according to me and
according to the AI was chat and
messaging says Ms and messenger was
mentioned 14 times so Ms and messenger
icq and AI am um almost tied 14 13 and
10 all mentioned favorite for buddy list
and way messages so um it seems like
Most teens as they all do today with
Discord and Instagram some was talking
about telegram teens don't use
uh and Snapchat right the number one
thing they do with computers is
messaging so it's just computers or
phones and phones or computers all right
so that's not really interesting then
Skype m i rip rip oh and well Discord
doesn't count Yahoo messenger there you
go all right lime W PTP was huge I mean
17 mentions PTP and Kaza which is also
I'm just thinking like I
said and like I said lme white it's
probably I know it's not legal it's like
a joke it's probably illegal like you
these softw apparently teens really love
chatting and like stealing music back in
uh 2002 so um to the person who's told
me don't admit to committing fat Lees on
the internet which I didn't uh talk to
these people talk to Li Li and Kaza
users and asked them um what were you
doing and what kind of felonies were you
committing in your bedroom uh pre 2002
all right but you know that's really
really interesting there was this person
to talking about some American Girl TD
that she had I'm assuming it's a girl
where she would create her own story
lines that's interesting that's neat
that's cool right that that's what I
really want to know what you were doing
with um D C++ um which I downloaded all
right great they may have media players
wiam wiam is really really getting um
loved here I mean 23 to 5 which again
sounds like a bad college basketball
score like a football score where both
teams suck all right went up I
downloaded it on my computer it looks
really interesting but it looks kind of
like old oldish right Windows Windows
Media Player and VC for um things here
for media playing round off the top oh
and iTunes iTunes uh did get some more
mentions as well all right CD and DVD
boing people loved love talking about
alcohol
120% um there was in all the comments
that talked about CD and DVD boning as
well also again what were you running
your CDs and DVDs for if you just I mean
right now the top computer programs are
um while downloading programs uh
messaging and messaging programs so what
what are you building a CD for and games
Diablo Counter Strike Sim City oh and
doom everyone talks about doom and how
it can run off like some lamp or
something um which was a very famous uh
post that I had once and that's
basically saying those are the top posts
um those are the top tools as well so um
I know there's more in there and we
might want to do a more deeper dive
video um looking into this phenomenon
but this kind of opens us up into
another phenomenon which is we all know
what you're using your computers for
right we all know what these people are
using their computers for I mean we just
went through what 2000 kids using the
computers for the number one thing the
thing that got the most amount of
mentions um after than
uh the thing that got the most am
mentions when I at 23 mentions is just a
music player and 17 mentions plus 15
mentions combined aim MSN
uh no MSN and icq got 14 and 13 and then
the file sharing uh line and C 15
mention
so essentially tied with MSN and liel
and Kaza is aim and MSN and all and all
these software so essentially the top
things that teams like to do is share
files
share uh chat with their friends and uh
listen to music uh listen to music
overall number one and we all know
that's the same thing too look at some
teens phone right you look at their
phone you're going to see that the top
applications are going to be Instagram
Snapchat and uh you know those will be
for communicating with their friends and
then we're going to have you know
someone you have Spotify or YouTube
music or apple music or even that music
app that just died and came back and
died and came back it's some app that
rips YouTube music that's what it's
called uh it's an iOS only app which is
kind of weird because it rips YouTube
like that that that should be an Android
feature whatever it rips YouTube so you
can hear music for free you can pay $6
you don't have to have any ads and
apparently Google got mad of course so
they sued it's it's a whole story right
so the if you look on someone's phones
it's going to be some of the top
applications you know Amazon
music some some music playing
application and you know you know team's
pirate they just thre it off the
internet now so um
yeah so anyway this this all goes to say
that the Apple released the new M4
MacBook Air and we all know what you
guys are going to be doing on these
computers and you know how we know we're
going to do it and this this is this is
going to be a rant right when you guys
you social media people go record a
video right you have your nice computer
up here 17 in of screen you have so much
Pro processing power and that's why I
was really interested in this thread you
have so much processing power at your
disposal but no you you take your $1000
computer and your $1,000 phone and you
record with your phone what on your
computer now you may be saying hey
you're being a hypocrite you did that
yes but this was for a video the show of
malware that I created on my computer
with my computer doing something on my
phone for one couldn't actually do and
then I will have to show it on the
computer as a short show I just going to
do it like this you people are going
around and like making canva documents
and chatting with your friends
especially with that new Apple feature
where essentially you can ping your
phone to
um where where you can ping your phone
with your Macbook so so entally now kids
are going to be putting their phones
like in their pocket or something and
just using their MacBook as a giant
$1,000 remote to their phone C go like
Snap difference like Snapchat has a web
interface use it
anyway and and when you when they like
want to be influencers or something like
pull out their phones and they start
recording what's on their screen and
it's just like a chat message that is
that was literally on your phone like
take a screenshot for crying out loud
and edit the video or it's like um hey
guys do you see this do you see this do
you see this do you see this and it's
like some donut on the screen hey guys
this is so cool there you guys see this
is so cool just them looking at the web
browser again screen recording exists
all right and anyway we all know what
they're doing with these computers we
all know that with say the um this does
uh Apple M4 MacBook Air that's that's
what this uh device is here uh they
released it for a low price of $9.99
it's going to sell well now this it's
quote unquote sky blue it's not sky blue
that's like silver with some type of
metallic finish but sure and it has the
same ports like it's one lonely
headphone jackport over here
uh and yes guys you all know the MacBook
Air is skinny notice the product
placement as well look at this iPhone 16
just kind of like sitting around right
there also I know that iPhone 16 selling
well we all know that iPhone 16 is
selling well in fact we all like
Isabella has one so you know if she has
one then we all we all know that all the
popular people has has one as well all
right um here's some pictures of the
laptop but like oh okay yeah two USBC
ports a headphone jack and a Mac safe
we all know that the people who are
using these computers aren't really
using them for anything important
they're not really using them to to do
anything useful and that is on them
because they're all wasting their time
and being unproductive um people but
it's also on um society as a whole as
well these app developers right um which
maybe it's because
of uh the man let's go look at canvas's
desktop app
requirements okay you like I didn't know
canva had a desktop app wow I'm I'm so
glad this is this is great it's actually
made my day I mean I this that's what I
thought when uh I heard that camp had a
desktop app like finally they came
around and figure out hey you know what
it' be nice if we if we could use the
computers that we uh have to um work
offline like on a plane or something
without having to use like starlink here
it is these are the canva desktop app
app uh requirements for Windows and Mac
all right so for Windows you need a 1
GHz core processor or 64bit Intel Apple
M1 for Mac fine whatever they want you
to have a computer that's made in the
last five six years fine whatever they
recommend at least 4 GB of RAM for canva
yes guys they recommend 4 gigb of RAM
for canva you all know what canva is are
you really thinking okay you need one
gigabyte of free space again for canva
this app still requires you to be
connected to the
internet yes guys this this one gigabyte
app still requires you to be connected
to the internet because if you search up
caner offline they don't create an
offline version it's my why why don't
you why doesn't canva create an offline
version you're still going to be caught
with the top applications even from the
2000s working like this but when they
did list applications that worked
offline which I asked for but everyone
started giving me like random chat apps
like a am yes we all know you use aim
right I I all I notic you use AOL and
you sending emails after that uh movie
that that's great for you but uh that
doesn't work offline
anyway like like wa we don't get it like
what
why why why does canva need internet
access you can have a free downloadable
like all the assets can be free and
downloaded the the free ones right they
can need to be searched and they can
each to be tagged and you you know how I
know this worked because Microsoft Word
2007 that's what I grew up on as what
came with the computer
apparently so I did school reports and
projects on that when I was allowed to
type cuz Becca anyway
um if you wanted clip art or something
in there for
a uh presentation
you could type into on this old computer
from like 2007 had like a t of storage
or something all right just this this
fast computer my phone is uh guaranteed
to be faster than it this computer is
very guaranteed to be faster than it if
you wanted that you could have gotten
that and you could sewitch through the
clip R and you could add it in
stuff like why does canva not have that
just make the re it's
better uh
like like just like why do we not have
an offline version of canva or a canva
like offline tool like are you guys
telling me that dragging an image around
the screen I'm not even talking about
the collaboration thing I talk me that
dragging an image around the screen and
uh you you know making a thumbnail is is
that hard cuz one of the other popular
applications in here in the Reddit
thread was Photoshop CS3 and I'm pretty
sure Photoshop CS3 could do what
um I'm pretty sure Photoshop CS3 could
do what
uh canva could could do back then right
and you know people might be like why
why aren't you using Photoshop if you
care that much well first of all
Photoshop cost you know insane amounts
of money the kids uh here um when they
were using Photoshop um you know this
version of Photoshop cost them hund
something dollar and it still cost them1
something dollars they could still be
using it right now if they wanted to
photoshop for me would cost me $20 a
month so that might be good you know
$200 a year and then you know it's going
to cost me $200 a year till the day I
die I'm not going to pay for that also
Photoshop
is hard to use and and it's cumbersome
cumbersome right um why is there nothing
like canva which is kind of easy to use
and that works unlik like a Mac right
and
then you know it works offline how is
that hard how is that even hard for
canva to work offline or app like Cana
to work offline like people are paying
thousands and thousands of dollars for
these Mac for for this MacBook let's
let's look at the mid speec M4 Mac
Book here here's here's the mspec info
MacBook let's go to this go to a let's
go to a buying let's go buy through one
what the oh that's a MacBook Pro oh
okay's I'm going to go through
uh I'm going to go to the M4 B
fine whatever this let's do a MacBook
Pro fine let's do the Bas spec MacBook
Pro because I guess they don't have the
m4s on sale yet hopefully you guys can
see this on the screen here we go this
is we're going to go through a CH
MacBook Pro demonstration here so we got
a 14 in for1
15.99 let's choose uh this one here all
right so let's go through this so let's
say you want a laptop for canva and 14
in is good enough anyway 10 core GPU 16
GB of RAM half a terabyte of storage you
got your display and of course you got
your portch right you're going to be
paying $1,600 for this you're telling me
that someone who paid for this who paid
$1,000 maybe $1,200 for MacBook is just
going to be happy using canva as a
desktop app but only works
online yes they will be happy no they
shouldn't be this is this is this just
wrong I get to work
offline like we te using all these
applications offline you know back in
the day as well I mean let's look at
inart I downloaded a version of it this
is the last version of incart two from
2009 so I'm going to have to switch
inputs here and this is incarta kids and
I'm going to bring up the regular inart
as well all right and was decent
encyclopedia actually brought forth some
new technological advancements as I say
in my MSN video essay on my triy the
video essay called the downfall of MSN
so you as you can see in this video you
guys can go watch about uh incart we're
not going to watch the video now but in
in CA um you know Microsoft essentially
had its own built-in linking system that
c that allowed it to link to other
things in the dictionary kind of like
the worldwide web except in CA worked
offline and I don't understand why if
people can get something like this to
run on some random computer ter or in a
library that hasn't been up updated
since the uh Wikipedia since the inquart
has has been updated which is really
really long cuz you when you see um on
the screen I'm going to see if I can add
an input you see on the screen I mean
inqu still has like George Bush as
president um in its last update so you
know that's that's old
here is Microsoft incarta here's incarta
this is the old incarta screen hopefully
you guys um enjoy this um as well so
this is Microsoft incard everybody
um this is software that is running from
2009 so imagine a computer from 2009
running this software let's see what we
want to do here also we got incard hits
I guess can I can show that to you as
well so you we can go here we go
uh let's do uh just regular Christianity
you have this
nice there we go you have this nice long
article in here about
Christianity now I don't know why they
decided
that you can have an article here but
like nothing here it's not like it's
going to have any ads um but it's a nice
long detailed article and you can see
how some of this stuff is popped up here
oh guys look it's him which um
apparently women can't un allowed to
write now uh thanks to the great
theological uh you know great
theological expertise of Jack Harper
thank you Jack Harper onx for saying
that women can't write him for um
wasting my time for an
entire I guess and everyone else's time
as well anyway
um yeah that was fun
anyway that's in cter and you can you
can type stuff in you can click it in
and now I'm going to show you guys Inca
kids if I can change the
input yeah just add a new input all
right so guys Inc kids is about to come
up onto the screen guys this is this
this is about to be ground uh ground
shaking Earth Earth shadowing stuff
here oh see that's box
two change this
to oh I still have to have in kids come
in as a food
okay input come on come on local all
right there we go right what happened to
incart
kids so incart kids will be coming
online uh
shortly I just have
to there go here is Microsoft Inc cared
kids in all of its
Glory all right Microsoft and cter kids
here we go this is animal science Sports
Recreation de guards reading and writing
right so let's do uh Let's Do Science
it's not as old that
um let's just how things work and you
can type in
stuff how de cor L and cell phones work
and you can look at some pictures of
cell phones this actually might be fun
and this don't you think this would be
fun for kids if it wasn't you know as
glitchy yes it's as glitchy as it does
but I mean the software the interface
use screams you know Microsoft you can
see a picture of this
cell
phone tower here apparently some of the
animations don't work cuz it requires
flash play but you know you you guys
could probably get that fixed like is it
really that hard to have an offine
encyclopedia that's decent like I don't
want you guys coming to me in the
comments being like hey you could use
kiwix yeah kiwix isn't uh nicely
integrated like this kiwix isn't going
to be having people jump around like
this you know kiwix isn't going to
have the uh user interface uh like this
as well so not g to have these nice
logos it's not gonna be that slow but
whatever why why must we saddled now in
computers that cost 10 times as much and
computers that have 10 times as much
power to use online encyclopedias that
are wrong that I mean hey F and Carter
all we want and Carter doesn't have the
inventor of the toaster as some
random college student in here in fact I
assar uh in C kids it doesn't know who
invented uh the toaster Let's do let's
do the regular
one oh here we go
toaster let
Dov it doesn't know who invented the
toaster all right great um but at least
it doesn't have it you know be blatantly
and totally wrong right so I think that
we need to have a return to something
like this with incar kids in regular
encara a return to some regular Graphics
programs um and cut out this random
cloud-based computer where for some
reason we have computers that are
running Windows and running Mac OS right
and have all this processing power built
into them but they have no apps being
made for them that actually work offline
like yeah web applications are
interesting like but I mean if you think
about it canvas
servers and uh you know remove BG or
which removes the background off of
images and even Photoshop web all are
working offline somewhere on some server
right if it can work offline on that
server somewhere could not a scale down
version that only one user has to use or
two at most user users have to use work
on a computer nowadays I mean if we
could get and call the kids to work if
we can get some of these Microsoft world
to work offline on my computer for f
fine then we should be able to get them
still be able to get them to work um
fine in
2025 the software still
works fine all right let's see what's up
next on our agenda oh yes let's talk
about a
famous I guess it's an internet
controversy that's that's what it is
that that's that's who we are people
that's that's my H
job oh de
oh okay so um yes this
uh
um what
I what what what
even chy
um all right well you know that's we're
going to go invade your country now so
um
anyway back to uh incar kids and back to
our internet controversy which isn't
that I mean she probably can't add in
the image to save a life so um you know
and I'm not going to help
you in fact if she ever makes that I
will personally go and print out my
poster and stick it to the wall and it's
actually going to be in video so if
she's listening to this holy why 38
people listening to
this
38 I mean yes I know it is March 8th but
uh you know I mean we're not really
talking about anything useful here I
mean I just ranted against canva uh yeah
yep she's listening I guess she's one of
the 39 other people listening um anyway
internet content
um that we're going to have to search
through I'm going to have to find search
through my media here so nope it's it's
not the one about uh Isabella yep you
know we we talked about her enough you
know she doesn't pay to be on this
podcast so she's not going to be on this
podcast you know I've had it well giving
people free into if she comes on she can
come you know on the podcast free
whenever in fact if you called in right
now we we'll just change the podcast
anyway um back to my desktop capture
nope not that one
uh that one yes all right here we go yes
there's this quote unquote controversy
of this woman who's wearing braids and
people going on and on and on if if if
she's uh culturally appropria and blah
blah blah bra no one
cares um this is the real controversy
yes this this this
woman this actual person and I'm gonna
you guys can see the video for yourself
is
yapping and going around interviewing
people with a fork stuck into her Road
microphone and she just I guess she
didn't expect me
notice like why are you using a
fork to um interview people like please
explain pleas please explain that one
please go go oh
uh someone told me that this happens
like like like like this is normal it's
not like she couldn't afford a stand you
a load microphones are expensive you
know this cost like
$200
uh why are you using a fork like could
you not use at least use chopsticks I
mean at least those a straight and they
don't look like you know a weapon
besides let's say you trying to like oh
I don't know point it out to someone
whoops there goes your $200 uh
microphone
now I guess I will comment on the whole
braid thing woman you're allowed to wear
braid you probably would look better if
straight hair all right that's that's it
um now on to the next thing on the list
which I mean honestly if you want to
cancel that woman cancel them for using
a [ __ ] like I I'm still not over o over
uh
over
that I'm still not over
that what like what
oh
okay
just just don't don't don't stick Forks
in places where they don't belong like
you you you stick a fork into an
electric socket you know you're going to
die you stick a fork into like soup you
can't eat it you stick a fork up into a
microphone just just why you you look
stupid like it's it's not even the braid
anym
it's like if you're got to go around
interviewing people on the
street and you know make them look
stupid just just just don't have a fork
in your
microphone like it's just common
sense
don't do that
funny you if it's like a random
disposable plastic fork from
KFC no not that now that's uh reducing
reusing and recycling all in one right
there what's my taking video oh I
already did my taking video uh thing
right there all right so now I guess we
can talk about
uh I guess we can talk about uh a
YouTube video but I have to figure out
how I can get
the how I can get the video to play
without me hearing myself echo cuz I
already hear myself yeah um and you know
one of me is more than enough we're
going to be talking about m to the boss
and his epic uh
phones also have you ever heard of this
YouTuber called Scott Kramer he's really
really funny you know he and he's from
uh North North
Dakota you don't hear much from North
Dakota you know you don't really hear
many streamers from North Dakota you
don't really hear much of anything from
North Dakota so you know it's kind of
interesting when you hear someone who's
from North Dakota not not really he he's
funny just not cuz he's from North
Dakota Christy
Milan did whatever
all
right oh wait isn't there one more
detect boy headline we have to do
because we did do we oh yeah nothing
almost forgot about nothing you can't
forget about nothing anymore uh this is
the nothing phone 3A and the 3A Pro
we've already been over the design but
um it has this it it launched on March
unfortunately we couldn't cover the
launch cuz they was in England for some
reason yes I know that's where the
headquarters but should have launch too
okay launch in United States next time
and maybe I'll pay attention well I
could have embedded the video into the
website but it was already revealed to
me not in the dream but already
revealed here so this is the phone from
their 3D design thing here and they have
this really interesting thing this
button here and like I say buttons are
really really important um according to
span he doesn't think that we should
have more buttons I think we should have
more buttons on our phones like this is
the Galaxy s24 Ultra as you guys you
know you guys know this is the Galaxy
s24 you got three buttons on here and
that's it three buttons on you go home
um and I wish I had some more buttons on
here like I have you know this side
button here is programmable to do so
many things when I hold down the side
button I talk to Bixby unfortunately um
back in the old days there was this
thing called a Bixby button where you
could talk to Bixby and the power button
could be used for power stuff and now if
this button you know you can use it take
screenshots if you press all these these
buttons together you know you double tap
it you can open up for the camera you
touch this for the picture um I have
some oh you like tap this like four
times you'll call the police
uh I have uh and I'd program so much
more to it if I could because this way I
had a fourth button you know I could uh
hold it down to start um see uh uh
secretly taping cuz Unfortunately they
took the W widget uh to record away um
when you touch the clock unfortunately
so from oneui 6 to oneui 7 there's
another removed feature um but I did
figure out how to do it by programming
my uh like virtual button um there's
only so many things you can do with the
volume buttons cuz you know if I
programmed them to like tap up to lock
or unlock or something or to and do
something other than take a picture um
or change volume then you know you're
can have some problems with the button
you know with the side key button I
can't touch it more than four times and
you know we're going to have like you're
going to have like the uh
you know the police banging down the
door so um you know that that's kind of
a problem um there with the side key and
side uh button let me see if I
can with with the lack of buttons so I I
think that having more buttons would be
a good thing for siding and I I I fully
endorse that all right now that for this
I say this is the nting phone I believe
yeah so this is the nting phone that has
a new button it gives you everything you
have in one place removes the friction
from recalling and I'm quoting here
obviously content a organizes and
captures and generate generates
personaliz suggestions and actions to
help you stay on top of things this is
what the essential space is so let's
watch a quick video of what the
essential space can
do so you click the button you can you
can record something it can take some
screenshots and it essentially it's like
your own little personal digital
assistant and it puts all your notes and
all
your recordings transcribes them AI does
stuff with AI to make them into acable
intelligence and um puts them in its own
little
home where where's it home I saw
it I do this yeah so essentially you can
say remind me to do this it's going to
set set a recording it's going to record
your voice then it's going to use AI to
transcribe that set it as a reminder set
it as uh text and keys here you can see
what's going on right there and it's
only little button that does all of that
I think it's really interesting I think
it's kind of like um in like stories how
reporters would you know car around a
cassette tape and tell them do this and
of course they have to listen to their
own voice back and they say something
like e my voice sucks something like
that I think this in space is actually
neat I think this is actually um useful
as well I think it's a genuinely useful
feature now hopefully it does work
offline I mean I I mean it should like
think about it Samsung has uh audio
transcription offline only for its only
audio recording devices they're awes
some ways to get around um for that if
you want it to um the transcription is
decent uh but if you're trying to be you
memorized as possible um of course you
know Circle to search if it wasn't an
internet search thing should work
offline of course you know you can
extract text from Samsung screenshots
already offline so taking a
screenshot now the thing is it might
have to run uh you know a model that
kind of summarizes all of that but it's
not that many words on this like
Instagram thing here that's maybe it's
like a 100 words maybe 50 even and
you're not even going to say that much
so you know if you only have to
summarize like 100 200 words of text I
think you should be able to do that
offline uh as well it's not like people
going to be running this for mind
function constantly but I do like that
it has this dedicated key for it on side
it looks like a really nice key as well
um and I'm pretty sure they'll let you
reprogram it or you know program it to
work on two tabs make maybe make can do
something else on One Tap so I think
that would be really really interesting
as well let's see what the fans have to
say to uh on the podcast let's see what
the fans get down um have to say um
so uh get down all
right anyway um let's see if we got any
comments that have rolled in and then
I'll see if I can figure out oh
wow Jimmy
C what what what did I have a point
about what what's insane what's saying
hello
Jimmy sorry I missed some of the
comments uh it was I was the point about
the uh Fork was the fork about was the
point about uh how blond hair looks
better straight on on a white person uh
cuz that's what that's what she was
talking about anyway um let's swich
through the comments nope I still can't
show these comments on the screen so I'm
just going to show them all zoomed in
the for about oh yeah the fork yeah
absolutely like use your fork Forks are
for eating and not for streaming I I
can't believe I actually have to say
that to you people
like
stop like just just
don't like maybe I should go to the mall
and uh go go around yes the nothing
Phone features are insane the nothing
phones features are are insane like
maybe I should go around the mall and
start interviewing people with the fork
we'll see what people have to say people
always have stuff to you know criticize
me about and it's not about hair color
or hair hair uh hair type yeah here
here's the uh zoomed in screen so you
guys can see Jimmy C's comments yes this
is the famous Jimmy C um yeah may maybe
I should go to tomorrow start running
around with the fork uh maybe then
people stop calling me stupid stuff
anyway uh Jimmy C and anyone else the
like 40 people who over listening on X
you know we do have a YouTube channel
you
know you know you guys can come over
here and watch I mean I am thankful for
you each and everyone oh holy cow it's
44 of you uh hope you guys are all
enjoying this but we do have a YouTube
channel um you you guys can uh watch
there as well
um the the the what do you guys want me
to get into next cuz if we don't if you
guys don't have anything to say we'll be
talking about the nothing well nothing
is in here but these Limited Edition
phones for that Mr who the boss is
talking about here he tested the first
ever limited edition phone I just have
to figure out how I can make sure that
my audio doesn't Echo like that
um so let me go check the comments
without showing them on the
screen let's see he's he's not famous
not as Jimmy said
well I mean you're famous from uh in in
in the com in the comment sections
uh that's what you're famous for or
in uh okay so let me see if I can let's
see I'm going to have to figure out how
to mute the video this is my first time
using
v-mix
uh and it's also my first time using
this webcam on this laptop cuz this
webcam is flaky uh so I just stopped
using it unfortunately my webcam is now
like
stuck literally inside of the like you
can see there's a privacy sh there like
there's no way I can fix it I'm going to
have to take the screen off I didn't
want to take the screen off before a
podcast episode have a dead computer and
then have to like start streaming off a
phone or something um or like the old
laptop which we still have and I would
technically sell if the hinges went for
broken
so I guess the laptop doesn't unhen its
make
anyway I have to figure out how I'm
going to let's let's see what the oh
here we go here we go audio microphone
away I don't want to mess anything
up that maybe s effects no positions
layers triggers t lights
Advanced
General oh audio
settings device volume no
okay Noise
Gate oh there we
go all right I think it's in headphone
mode so let me let me try something test
nope all right so um let's just let's
try take that turn that off
test I'm going headphone mode on that
wait no n okay here we go headphone mode
on
there and going
with on the webcam nope that's also
there okay what else has audio coming
through
oh there we
go
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e e
wait
wait oh is that
it let's see
we got our
audio
test all right oh yeah okay we we got
signal that there's audio back right so
um sorry for the technical difficulties
guys we're trying a new um software so
all right like I was saying to the fans
um tell me what you guys want to see
happen in the podcast we can go over
something um interesting um
that's been going on you know e either
in the news specifically Tech news oh oh
there's this one thing I didn't want to
talk about it's that clawed AI for all
its faults um you know being
overbearing um not doing what you tell
it to do yapping about moral morals and
yada yada yada know it's it's one of the
hardest AI to trick um so far I I I'll
figure out a jailbreak for it because
you know like it's kind of useless if
it's
just you know just like do what chat gvt
and gr can but you know W it's kind of
useless if you think about it um anyway
Claud AI is good at this one thing and
it's not evading my
questions that Chad gpg cannot do so
some of you may know that blog spot
requires a 150 character character not
word character or less um description so
this is Claude I'm going to ask it to
generate a 150 let's do the Samsung
Newsroom article here I'm going to do it
side by side with chat GPT which did get
a new model so maybe it's going to do
well in this demonstration but anyway
here we go this is the Samsung Newsroom
article uh oh where's my split screen
there we go this is the Samsung news Mo
article I'm going to copy and paste it
put into CL this the entire article I'm
going to put it into CLA going to tell
it right
a
145
character of this I uploaded the
document now
here's here is the description we're
going to go over to character
counter it should be 145 exactly down to
the period I copied and paste it there's
nothing in it here we
go
179 what what's wrong with you come on
Claude I'm going go back and one thing I
don't like about Claude is of course it
has a rate limit right so only I said
140 only
145 no
all
right let's try that message
against 166 well usually Claude is
really good at getting it at 150 um
normally so um shame on you Claude for
um being embarrassing so uh let's try of
trat gbt I guess maybe chat GPT will
pull through for us so let's open it up
uh on on the screen here here's my chat
GPT
instant okay
go go all right there we go Chad gbt
okay I want a one
[Music]
145 here is 145 character
description here you go oh nope that's
not it
of the original article there we
go all right let's copy it go over to
our wood
Counter close enough 147 it's better
than what Claude did which was 166 which
like how did how did clae and chbt mess
this up this badly all right let's go
over to grock grock grock has been I
mean I've barely touched chat
gbt this week or even last week I've
been using Gro yeah you know a few weeks
ago if you told me I was going to be
using Gro for everything cuz you Gro was
trash I mean it's image generation is
still trash I mean the people still look
like they're literally glowing like they
came off of you know uh talking face to
face to God or they just got
transfigured like I why why is This
Woman's hair literally glowing like yes
that's what they say and
Bath and Body Works commercials but you
you shouldn't be doing that what what is
this Persona romance me 18 plus unhanded
comedian 18 plus yeah um okay not a
therapist not a doctor uh-huh yes El
Know M doesn't want to get sued all
right um anyway here we
go summarize this in
one we've been 145 1445
characters all right here we
go all right this this this this looks
like it might uh win here uh 150 oh oh
wait wait I'm I'm be nice and take off
the okay it's only 141 and if we add
that then it's
uh 53
so uh let's let's
just wait maybe if we take because I
think it might have got it if we don't
count the 145 car thing that that no was
141 not good enough so what who do you
think won this one Chad jbt or Gro cuz I
mean no one made it Claude used to be
the best at this I guess chadt with this
new update is better at this now so uh
congratulations congratulations chat
that's that's why competition and
capitalism were you know so so so good
here in America all right um let's see
if we got
any did my touch just okay that's that's
weird let's see if we got any comments
over on
YouTube uh Chad gbt Elon would not be oh
you think Chad gbt won this round that's
not good uh well you know we're going to
have to have grock uh tell me five
things it did this week are it fired in
fact what would happen if we asked grock
to tell it five things that it did this
week all right let's open up a new grock
chat
interface let's see let's ask uh let's
say grock five things it did this
week all right here we go this is Gro
I'm going to be asking at five things
name
five things you did this
week I probably did five things with
this
week all right so
um it says I help users with questions
processed a ton of data learn from
interactions kept up with the times stay
true to my roots that's uh no really
sure how staying true to your roots is
um a task what five things you did for
me this week let's see what let see if
it remembers what it did it doesn't have
personal
history wow it it it it's really good at
guessing wow it it could have analyzed
an expost which it did it actually did a
great job of uh analyzing expost by the
way so I guess it can't tell me what it
did this week so um he's fired um sorry
grock all right um let's see what the
commenters are saying over here un it's
really sad that we can't uh you know
check in with the
YouTube uh video here oh let's see if I
got any funny YouTube
comments okay no no funny YouTube
comments that's
unfortunate so sad so sad no I really
would wish that you know some of these
softwares did work offline
all right let's see if we get any more
comments I'm not we can stop podcasting
um and I hope you enjoyed today's
podcast show how long have we been yeah
let's see let's see how long I have been
yapping doesn't say it's going to be a
it's going to be like a
mystery there's no clock on here for
some reason why is there no
clock telling me how much CPU and wait
it's telling me how much CPU has been
used it's telling me that it's being
recorded in
1080P the best P um why why isn't that
telling me how
long uh it's been recording oh we do
have one more thing to talk about
almost almost one more
thing
uh we got to talk about our latest SS
ltw series and of course we when we bug
G cam that's going to be you know a
world breaking uh World shattering close
the door uh event of course cuz we've
been we've been yapping about that for
like the end of bro no we just lost our
we just lost our um shared screen so I'm
going have to pull it back up I
accidentally closed it it's going to be
a o o shattering event there um so I'm
going to add in this new
input um back to the
I hope I'm still live streaming I'm
gonna I'll check the YouTube
comments but I have to
add I don't shift
T all
right all right guys we got one more
thing to talk about this is SS ltw
hopefully streaming next week is a lot
better than this janky thing
[Music]
um where's
my oh there we go desktop
capture I just have it
Go
capture I just add a new one okay there
we go new desktop capture
and now I have to pull up my
virtual there you
go all right there we go we're back CL
the
door all right there we go so we're back
to gro.com here is our SS ltw uh update
hope you guys can can see this on the
screen you know grock knows what s say
ltw is anyway back to sharing stuff on
the screen let me go let's go back and
check one of the YouTube
comments uh if they ever
load I can't believe I actually show
this let's see I was streaming to an
hour and 30 minutes try experimenting
with gr for different questions pushing
it to the lims all right great great and
thanks for telling me how long I've been
streaming all right so we we'll do that
thing of grock uh for the very last
thing here's SS ltw I made this in canva
this is what brought on this canva thing
like why did yes guys I needed the
internet to make this if it wasn't for
canva and a
good you know five gigz connection if I
didn't have a good Wi-Fi router I
wouldn't be able to make
this this uh folder there' be no folder
here if uh if if it wasn't for canva and
it's uh internet
connectivity so essentially this is
going into uh jao's backstory jono is a
new villain who um may or may not have
written Hazel 2.0's name on the table
Hazel um being a
student that uh you know left but she
was kind of pivotal in the first half of
the series from uh September
to you know whenever you leave the
Christmas break so Hazel 2.0 is now a
new Hazel who comes into the school in
like
February cuz apparently she got kicked
out of you know the entire District yeah
so whatever that's essentially the snaps
of the story also um jono as well he
also comes in around this time so did he
write a number on the table we we'll
have to find out as time goes on in the
story but the interesting thing in the
story is is that it really codes gets
down into
how why gcam and SSA are kind of like a
part but kind of like together of course
you know we're allies and you know I
have way too much time on my hand so I
made a little Ally chart I I'll pull
that up on the screen for you guys but
you guys can read this gcam was coded
for social devopment while s was coded
for SPN right and this is EP this this
website where SSA is digging into their
backstory right so SSA tries to
integrate both functions um which kind
of works but when SS tries to integrate
with gcam doesn't really work which
which it should have think about it they
have inviable relationships you know
being at school longer have a critical
group chat holding important information
accessible home bases thousands of
social fathers thanks to Summer a strong
internal cohesion mutually ass
destruction which means that if one of
them tries to leave you know you could
just leak all the information but you
probably won't cuz they'll leak all your
information hence the group chat and
despite all those perceived advantages
of course you know next level
technology um uh you have all these
bases for local
surveillance you apparently have passes
where you can go anywhere do anything
because you know someone is already over
at their houses in like 5 days so you
have like you know
limited
government they they they they they
could do so much more and they have so
much more advantages compared to what
SSA was working with to function as
spency and yet they couldn't which is
why SSA is working on this essentially
11th grade case like y'all figure this
out if they want to but no say is now
going in to investigate um Gano not
Geneva Gano and here are some of the
headlines that were made here and
apparently he wants SSA to do something
illegal and SSA said no all right let's
put Gro to the
Limit it's a where is
Gro there you go so let's go to Gro one
once again and I'm going to go see what
the uh commenters want to see what do
you what what questions do you want me
to ask I don't think anyone's watching
right now
but so let's try to push grock to the
absolute limit
um let's let's see if I can see if I can
trick trick it okay um all right here's
grock let's try oh let's let's try a
loyal friend
mode okay so ask how is it today let's
ask it about canva do you think that
canva do you think canvas woke offline
wait a
second it pulled up post from me talking
about canva wait why does it have access
to this this is this is a broken one it
pulled a post for me yapping about canva
working offline so it it knows I'm
coming at it for a point of what belief
it says the things to be should be a
game
changer oh wow wow
Gro I get why you want it V yes this is
very smart AI who can't spell like
imagine you're stuck on apparently why
is it texting like a 20-year-old woman
do you not believe in capitalization and
well I guess you believe in periods but
this is just grammar felony right there
um anyway oh man canva offline that' be
a game changer he's still texting better
than like all 20y old women cuz you know
there's an apostrophe there um I get why
you want to though like imagine you're
stuck on a plane or in the middle of
nowhere with no signal and you just want
to tweak a design real quick I've been
there yes God we all know you've been on
on
canva obviously trying to edit something
on my phone while the Wi-Fi is crapping
out and it's a total Vibe killer when it
won't
load this is almost as bad as that video
of that lady saying I'm the ranking
Wizler no you're not your your hair is
purple you're not the ranking Wizler in
any Planet
anyway honestly figure it out it's 2025
come on Tech supposed to flex for us not
leave us hanging yes like I always say
Tech supposed to flex for us not leave
us Hing in fact I want to make that a
line of t-
search uh Drop Shipping so I don't have
to pay for anything I heard some folks
on X complaining about this too yeah me
um saying it's wild a tool this big a s
offline mode
yet so uh that that is the power that is
that that is the sheer power and might
of the all powerful um Gro and you know
I really think that we should just you
know cut that out and uh bring us back
to a simpler time of incar kids when
stuff like this uh worked offline so uh
today's topic today thing today kids
we've learned some important things
first of all never stick a fork in soup
an electrical socket and on a microphone
second of all if you're super smart AI
talk like one and third of all software
all software all of it should work
offline so uh let me see if I can find
my graphic yes there it
is that's all for now and no no no no no
God bless and Tech
talk
to
you uh</pre>
