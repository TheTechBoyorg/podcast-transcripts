um I'm almost done sharing this and
we'll get right into but we posted this
week the tech boy
um okay here we go
now
okay all right so what we posted to this
week in the tech boy podcast
um
I'm in that podcast website so
let's get right in to
it
don't you know you can find this on
techboy.com for those of you who
recognize me from where I've been this
week um feel free to leave a comment
chat whatever
um I want to get to know you
um in fact I'm trying to find someone so
you've recognize me you can put it in
the chat there and here we are Tech boy
podcast our number one post was the
image versus M7 once again pixels coming
in again we only posted one thing this
week because I was away
um I posted this from my phone you saw
the chat GPT enhancements I think that's
how to access special characters on yes
Samsung Galaxy uh device so you can
check that out check that out but we
also it seems like a lot would happen
while I was gone
um
meta launched Twitter
not Twitter threads meta threads
Instagram threads that's what it's
called right Instagram threads exams on
delayed their VR headset
um
mixed reality headset because they're
impressed by what Apple did
um
so yeah let's get into that matter
threads has launched and I'm not on it
there's over 10 million downloads in the
Play Store and unfortunately it's app
only you can't access the web version
like you can web Instagram
um and it also required not requires but
request my permissions and let's just go
to these lists now of course all of
these are
um
let's go mandatory but let's let's just
go through what they what they need here
okay so I'm gonna share my my screen
with you guys and let's move on
right so from how to geek Instagram
stretch is a decentralized uh oops
is it is going to become decentralized
you need an Instagram to pick out to use
it and of course you need Android or iOS
device and here it is the data that they
need and we're going to go through yes
or no for if they need it Health and
Fitness
I don't think so purchases depends um we
learned that Facebook is launching an
application store inside like it's going
to be its own application store like on
Android or whatever so if they're able
to do that provides it might make sense
if you want to sell to pay that
Financial info it kind of links in
purchases location depends if you want a
geotag photos or your location or
whatever contact info
makes sense contacts again makes sense
we want to find use the content I don't
know if that means it doesn't mean like
content you posting to app because
whatever anyone can see it search
history depends if it's social students
like the app hey that's fine so just do
it on your phone big note browsing
history the same thing as last time
identifiers what kind of identifies like
Bluetooth ID mattresses data okay
whatever sensitive info
what does that even mean all of this is
sensitive
Diagnostics what what
[Music]
photos videos mix-ins audio again makes
sense calendar I I don't know why
um but
oh here it is Instagram threads now I I
may want to do this
see how fast I could get there right on
an ALT account what do you guys think
what do you guys think uh no one in the
chat yet but whatever okay
um
yes dredge is censoring people really
fast
and um there's an image of all the
things that needs from well it doesn't
need for me
um and if you want to leave threads
before you have to delete your Instagram
account now this Tuesday boss had an
interesting video about this and I want
to react to it because
you know I like him I like his content I
think he's very uh upbeat but uh he's
dead wrong he is deadlock okay let me
show it to you guys this too
close
now he's not like so bad like some other
Tech creators out there who who make uh
increasingly criticized fans because
like we didn't talk about last week some
of these people don't know what their
thing that they're talking about but
he's also in England so he's not
American so I mean we'll give him
somebody right Lee way but um
let me show you this video and you can
etori presents how to invest in stocks
in 30 seconds just open the app click 10
million users in the first seven hours
meta the company behind Facebook and
Instagram has just declared war on
Twitter with their new app threads and
this is the most fascinating exciting
terrifying thing happening in social
media right now so first of all do I
even think threads has got a chance of
becoming mainstream do I think directors
are changed becoming mainstream
sure I mean if your application has 10
million downloads in the Play Store the
Google Play Store hello
and you don't even have access to like
30 something countries how many
countries have been you
uh
how many
28
let me check
these are countries that are
predominantly Android using 27 27
countries in the EU so I guess that's
not counting correct because it flexed
it in anyway
um 27 countries in the U predominantly
Android users over them to EU I know
this because uh European team came to my
school like two years ago and they use
Android I think it's predominantly
Android
just not in America and Japan
China I think yes like some of those
countries so yes that is a big deal well
let's put it this way right now my 60k
follower account on threads which also
60k that's
pretty decent for I don't know day one
day two but I wasn't on my what
percentage
all right no church yet okay okay he's
getting more engagement than my 1.7
million follower account on Twitter I
mean look at this this is not normal for
a 60k follower account on any platform
but yeah the excitement levels for this
new app they're not just high they are
unlike anything I've ever I mean makes
sense it's supposed to have been a long
time that we've had an actual
social media
like what Lewis social medias have
launched in the past five years okay
there's like beware which is um
stupid
it's not stupid
oh look I
get no chat functions you take a picture
twice a day
no okay there's um
past five years uh
uh okay not to be social but like
uh
no offense to people or what not to be
but I'd say only a couple thousand
people use it
I I don't know I don't have usage
statistics but um
yeah it's a very very specific Niche
um there's a
I mean I mean Odyssey
which I don't that's about social media
go read my article YouTube is not social
media for that for the same reason I
don't
but
no so this is basically the most
mainstream newest social media I mean
Mastodon got some string but it's not
new uh newest social media application
on the planet that's not Niche I mean it
just needs that it's kind of centering
people watch yourself on ntp but in the
broad scheme of things I've seen before
but why because it's in the right place
at the right time all I've seen on
Twitter these past few months is oh I
hate this app now oh Elon Musk has
ruined this apple why is Twitter the
place where everything has to be and
that's one side perspective but okay
there are reasons for that I mean
Twitter has dialed up the ads you'll see
one like every five posts
sure because Twitter was profitable but
yeah
you've lost so many bot accounts and
just oh this lady
I don't know who he's calling Dubai is
he calling
Greg Bowden host of American bottle
whatever
the body count or obviously calling that
person about it because she
we can we can go back and read what she
said over on NTB uh what was that a week
ago
um give me some time for this to load oh
yes yes it was affirmative
action
let's see message to the tags
affirmative action
okay
I think it was Delight dude let's see if
I can switch by date no let's keep going
um well we'll get back to this lady
um I'll keep searching my watch video
inappropriate accounts parading around
without getting flagged I mean Twitter
charges people to be verified now oh wow
imagine that charging people to be
verified not like meta would ever do
something like that oh wait they did you
can go check it out on uh my website
thetaway.org and then search meta
okay
okay
moving on wait it's a new track oh hi
super highlative hello oh really of
course you missed me Tuesday
um
uh I'm gone I
I'm back in Houston I'm in the studio
um
okay hello hello everybody but talk
we'll be liking this video oh oh and I
almost forgot am I buy me a coffee link
if you guys want to contribute
uh I will post it down in the chat
I'm here coffee.com
and we're also gonna have to get into
this uh new Google search AI
it's new Google so it's AI is kind of
useful kind of intrusive
and the links down in the chat we have
two people here so if you have any
questions of course you can ask and I
will start playing the video as I keep
searching for it so you literally end up
in situations where you've got a fake
Elon Musk account which is paid to be
verified true but you don't put that
parody thing in there you will get to
give down at which point what does it
mean to be verified they've just limited
the number of tweets that you can view
in a day again unless you pay to
increase that limit to me it has felt
yeah that was kind of a mess but it's
it's like no longer a homely platform
like I just don't feel like I belong
there and so threads is basically
designed to be the opposite of that and
to capitalize on this downward spiral
sentiment that lots of people have
towards Twitter meta has made sure that
they've launched with zero ads that
they're not even thinking about
monetization until the app reaches a
billion youth
whew
you know all the people here let me talk
to them it's not gonna be part of they
don't have ads but people are just going
to make it on Facebook app and we're
just gonna let you use this for free
this is what Zuckerberg is saying which
is kind of crazy because if it does get
to a billion users that's already two
times what Twitter is they've made sure
that everyone needs to have an Instagram
account before they can register which
has done a lot to reduce the level of
Bot activity and I mean they're spoiling
us I mean you can see as many posts as
you want per day plus because it's
linked to your Instagram account you
don't pay for verification it carries
over from your Instagram to your threads
account for free instantly and the best
part of it is that so do your followers
that's that's a useful feature
um I'm wondering if since this is the
closest you open source with Tumblr
Etc if your father was over at Mastodon
spaces to it you know how threads has
managed to get this unexpected Buzz
about it it's because it's managed to do
the one thing that's really really hard
for a new platform to do and that's to
make it feel like everyone is all rare
so anytime one of your Instagram
followers signs up for Threads they're
following you already by default which
is giving creators this massive surge in
excitement and therefore an instant
incentive to start posting unique
content for those people all of this is
making threads feel like this New Haven
map like a fresh start the Twitter the
web everything is right in the world and
I can't believe I'm saying this but a
world in which Mark Zuckerberg is the
new People's Choice hero
is that for what it's interesting of
course it's just really good timing
combined with some very big brain
marketing and then the other side to
this coin is that they've also figured
out how to give people on the outside a
major fear of missing out you actually
get numbered based on how quickly you
registered account literally like
getting ranked in a race so I'm around
number 12 million now
and now to something new and exciting in
the AI space grammarly go it's a new
product that offers
yeah
probably won't make it to my resume but
the point is whatever you get given
that's your number permanently so there
was a rush to be in the first million
then there's a rush to be in the first
10 million now I guess there's a rush to
be in the first hundred million and then
when you sign up it lets you
preemptively add people for when they
join as if to say they are going to join
of course it's just you being ahead of
the game by being there before them but
also you know how I was saying that your
Instagram followers automatically get
added to your threads account yeah well
that only actually happens if you've
already registered so your incentive is
basically to hurry up
is there a time limit or something
I don't understand but okay to register
your account as fast as you possibly can
to make sure that you're getting as many
of those automatic follows as possible
like for me I was kicking myself when I
woke up this morning to the chaos that
was happening and realized if I just set
up my threads account eight hours before
before I'd gone to sleep I would have
woken up to 50 000 more followers
already there wow no don't be wrong
threads is not God's gift to mankind
it's missing features it's missing a lot
oh oh I get it now if you registered to
for dreads before someone else
registered so they'll automatically
follow you I think key features that you
really need for an app like this like
trending topics for example the thing
that actually makes Twitter different to
other platforms is that it's news first
you go on there as well as to argue with
people over the internet to learn about
what's happening with the world and what
people think about it it's got to be
grounded in real world events as opposed
to Instagram which is more what are my
friends up to or at least that's what it
used to be right now okay I found the
lady I found the lady here it is we're
going to show the term
Erica Marsh seems the lady that was in
that picture who was being called fake
me quote
uh you can read it for yourself
oops
there we go
oh wow
it's just
yeah
uh moving on to the video
it's more of a tick tock V 0.5 and there
is also a data problem you might have
noticed you definitely would have
noticed if you live here this app is not
available in the European Union because
he's in England
because the EU has very strict data
sharing policies that don't
wait okay if you're on iOS okay you're
screwed so but on Android okay
I know what
what how they how did it stop it
this does not yet comply with and it's
just going to be really hard in general
for people to have to start again you
know some people spend 10 plus years on
Twitter just grinding away to build up
that follower number to the point where
even if all the users that do still
matter to you and do still care about
what you're currently doing do move over
to threads and your engagement stays
just as high you are going to feel some
kind of loss from just not having that
big follow account that you've spent so
much time to accumulate yeah I guess key
message here is that if anyone can do it
it probably is meta you could say that
Twitter has met her they match
and they've been very open about the
fact that this is still a V1 they
probably wanted to launch the app in a
state where it was simple yes but stable
to then one by one add in the extras and
add in those final countries that
haven't quite made it in yet besides I
gotta give it to them the app itself is
kind of nice it's exactly what you would
expect it to be it's like Twitter like
let's be very clear there is zero doubt
that the designers studied Twitter and
consciously made this like it actually
was suing them for a copyright
infringement because
they use Twitter employees that had
access to confidential data and are
taking it or allegedly taken but with
some design elements of Instagram it's
named well I mean a thread is already
what people call a string of messages so
it's fitting and it also doesn't sound
like a joke like Mastodon
I mean all I can think of is just
dinosaurs yeah it's just easier to type
and
Mastodon is extremely buggy
um super highlighted
um do you have any questions
starting an online store is easier than
you think let me show you how to quickly
open one with shop
s
and it's simple you've got your news
feeds which is a combination of both
people you follow and those you don't
you can search for new people to follow
here you can write a threads this is all
your notifications which are very neatly
categorized although not fully working
in my experience like I have definitely
been mentioned but not according to this
tab and then there's you on the far
right this is your profile now as you
can probably tell it's not very
customizable it's not very fun to look
at right now and I wish you could double
tap post to like them and that the
interaction buttons are on the other
side of the screen I don't really use
that wasn't just doing things
um personally so I I don't really know
have a context what you're talking about
but yet it looks like that you like
but I mean maybe Jack is Left-Handed I
don't know
um
but if I'm gonna use something I just
hope it has a desktop proof there's
plenty of ways I would change this but
it's got the fundamentals right it's
easy on the eyes it seems to run well be
smooth and pretty bug free it's
inoffensive which is actually more than
you can say for Twitter right now
well he's keeping it like that for no
censorship for Central so
in fact
let me try something right now
okay while I'm working on this I'm going
to set up an account see how fast I can
get banned
and that's the benefit of starting out
and not trying to do everything at once
so honestly could threads kill Twitter
very possibly yes it sounds like a
Monumental feat I mean Twitter's
approaching 500 million users but
remember Instagram has two points and
even though threads is very blatantly a
direct copy that doesn't mean that it
doesn't have a higher ceiling I mean
Facebook killed Myspace Instagram killed
Snapchat just basically after copying
them and doing it better it seems like
Facebook's maybe the only
oh wow there's only a thing called beds
that has one million downloads that's
not an affiliated with threads by
Instagram interesting all right we got
it oh 10 million down to 12. okay
install I'm gonna have to set up a fake
Instagram account
okay we'll see how fast this it takes
maybe I'll do it live on stream let's
see
um if anyone of you have suggestions for
something that's about maybe like a
Bible verse or something okay
oh back to the video sorry it's not a
new thing for this matter company to do
a similar thing to what's already being
done and to just brute force them out
the picture if you're finding this video
useful by the way then a sub to the
channel would be incredible incredible
just like Fred's is trying to overtake
Twitter and subscribers we're trying to
overtake Apple so
speaking of subscribers do you think
Fred will introduce a subscriber
functionality to their software like uh
Twitter every subscriber helps but okay
here's what concerns me about the whole
thing look at Instagram Instagram today
is not at all what it originally set out
to be yeah that's where they have apps
like Vivo v-e-r-o I think let's see
application you can bypass that versus
things that you download apps on PC
uh oh back to the video
there you go started out was this
genuinely unique way to keep in touch
with your friends via photos but in the
process of continually following where
the money is it's now just yet another
glorified vertical video app most of
what I see on my feed is no longer my
friends or anyone I actually care about
it's just an algorithm who cares about
melting ice then it's designed to serve
you purposeless videos in such a way
that you can't look away and eventually
lose track of time and then you go to
Facebook meta's other main social media
app and it's far far worse but yeah I'm
just confused like why does Facebook
have wheels and Instagram it doesn't
make sense oh and I got the thread tab
open by the way I I I I I I just don't
understand
but you know I'm not really into that
let's see
all right all right oh I mean you can't
scroll past two posts without seeing an
ad then you get a suggested for you post
which is actually nothing related to you
there's a permanent sponsor tab on the
side which is filled with targeted ads I
mean it makes sense they have
okay
half a billion
half a billion right
okay what's my name be test detest boy
oh
okay
hopefully these numbers are already
interested okay let's keep my ads tons
of inappropriate content and a really
bad system for actually reporting it
but nothing ever seems to get acted on
it's alarming because this is
essentially what matters vision of a
successful product is and let me get me
started on the way they handle data I
mean meta's entire business model is
making money from profiling their users
tracking their activity to then sell
their eyeballs to advertisers I think
it's pretty fair to say no company on
the planet has a worse track record of
using people's data in dodgy ways and
yet they're asking for all of it here
when that's yeah we went to that and the
captain was necessary
you sign up to threads look at all the
stuff you have to agree to there's a
reason why threads is not up and running
in the EU yet this app even wants access
to your sensitive Health Data which
makes the government's there are rightly
asking why do you need this exactly and
if you sign up to threads there's no way
of not agreeing to every bit of this
data sharing and there's also a really
weird Clause that says you can't close
your thread account after opening it
unless you also close your Instagram
account that's just weird
to be sucked into that
into their Instagram about it which I
mean who's going to do that it's hard to
even comprehend like if this app does
beat Twitter how powerful meta becomes
as a company I mean for example I leave
Three Links in the description to all my
key social media apps for every video
and this would mean that all three of
those links would lead to platforms
owned by meta that's a monopoly that's
the most powerful Monopoly that exists
on the planet and is that not too much
power for a company who's shown that
they're willing to go to Great Lengths
to extract money from their users so
what I'm saying is that I do think the
threads app as it is right now is doing
a lot of things better than the
competition in a way that's made me make
more posts on this in a day than I've
done in a month of using Twitter but
also yeah he is kind of sports on
Twitter
so that there's very little to say that
it's going to stay that way I mean even
just reading between the lines of what
the CEO himself is saying let's get the
users first then start implementing the
money making yeah and like you know how
people hated the idea of the metaverse
and how this meta company would just own
people if threads actually kills Twitter
and meta ends up as this captain of
social media's it's it's very much step
one of that but at the same time I do
believe that people deserve Second
Chances so while past actions are
generally a pretty good indicator of
intent I'm willing to be proven
otherwise it is possible that meta sees
this not as a way to repeat the same
mistakes but a way to correct for them
and in the end is the users that make
these platforms what they are so if we
decide that we want to use this as a
positive force then what does he mean by
positive force that's uh Let's test this
out okay
all right
still going to do some passwords to
oh keep going that will automatically
make it a better place to be and to help
me do that this is my Fred's account
Freddy and waiting
should probably cut the video before
that yeah T-Mobile has the new Samsung
Galaxy
and we are back no one's here yet that's
the CRC vlogging info
never whatever okay here we go
I don't want to put for other bio
because it doesn't really matter
continue
all right uh no
no notifications
the ACT does look weird ish okay
um
all right I'm making my post
all right great
let's see how long is this
all right
um but let's get back to Samsung not
Samsung oh I guess we can talk about
Samsung right now Samsung
fixed reality headset 2020.
all right I'm going to share the screen
with you guys
uh is anyone watching one question okay
okay hello to the one person that's
watching thank you and you are welcome
here
and
um
let's keep going
right according to nine five to Google
the mixed reality headset is delayed
because I guess they looked at apples
and it's like wow this is very
impressive
uh Samsung XO has to delayed up to six
months as a result of Apple's Vision Pro
system now this isn't the system right
here that's uh gear VR S10
with the S10 on it
and I'm probably going to end in a few
minutes so let's keep going so
if oh it's supposed to be running
Android
so I don't know what do you think about
this let's check the chat oh hi Jay
power and hello Ariel
smith223 and welcome to the channel
so what do you think about Samsung's mix
we have the headsets being delayed
I'll wait for the chat to load
um anyway next reality headset being
delayed it's supposed to be running
based on Android and it's supposed to be
coming in six months and just says July
speaking of July on July 11th which is
three days from now the nothing Bound 2
is supposed to release
and speaking of nothing just something
like personal someone asked me and if
you're watching uh close your ears
someone asked me
um they said something for me if I set
the iPhone's better so now I'm going to
say that nothing's better than iPhone
hopefully they don't uh get the joke I
mean it's kind of true and that's also
pivots are often to Promos in this place
nothing wrong so I have problem nothing
nine English displays but iPhones
flagship 14.
that's has a 60hz display which is kind
of sad
uh you didn't know they had one l-o-l uh
they don't have one yet they said it's
supposed to come out in six months
and
Ariel Smith 223 says IDK which is short
for I do not know
all right
so it says that someone discovery of
Samsung's plans said translated from
Korean I understand the decision was
made didn't consider the specifications
of apples mixed reality Mr headset
physical Pro and competitive we decided
to reconsider
and it looks like Samsung gives Boe
panels which is a competitive they make
cheaper displays rather than LG Samsung
so Samsung said probably
you know wait or it was protected
um the Apple Vision Pro the Apple Vision
Pro is like a headset that lets you
see different things in different spaces
that allows you to it puts apps that Ari
you got Safari you have any messages you
have everything you need I have a video
about it like two weeks ago
um I reacted to someone calling it nerd
goggles which I think they're not they
have three 3D camera on it so you can
take pictures
Etc you can do all sorts of things like
that um so you can check out that
podcast episode I think it's two to
three weeks ago
um it's a picture of me uh
uh the guy was reacting to and then uh
virtual reality headset on the thumbnail
oh and speaking of AR Pig I
um here it is right here
we got AR
uh sorry a I
um baked right into Google and I can
converse with Google right now when it
comes up into such searches so if I
wanted to find out what this headset
does
um
release uh it's loading loading loading
is that supposed to release in 2024
about in 2023 I could chat with it it
can help me with my search results even
if I search a Bible verse and it's it's
pretty good so we're going to do a Start
experiment right here we're going to
reset the check and we're going to ask
it about me as you recall an area so it
says cool I'll check it out please do
you have some release chat maybe they'll
tease it at unpacked in August be able
to release it in February with the s24
series
but we're going to test this out
um
we're going to test this out
right now oh and for all the new users
here we have a brand new coffee you're
not obligated to do anything just if you
want to support the channel so
all right there it is
um and of course you can always support
it by liking and subscribing so we're
going to ask it what the tech point is
because it's fairly knowledgeable
um for those of you may know that in
March I got bored to describe my part my
thing in a very positive manner saying
it was a good Christian Tech uh Channel
sir good
um
so what is
all right taking it right from the
source
um two of the sources of filmographers
on YouTube channel and website and one
of the sources from our crunchbase page
uh I've got Tech boys and family
friendly Christian technology rock that
focus is on educating consumers and
Technology Goods about current
futuristic whatever including sexuality
technical interviews great and did you
find School gram you find a search
result saying that it's based in Houston
okay so I'm gonna ask
is it
it's in Houston Texas
[Music]
it seems like it's reiterating just my
description of the page but it is citing
some resources we've got the coin speech
page YouTube and Twitter and then of
course I can upvote and down vote the
results say Paris is nice yes
um
let's see
you know I I've spoken about this
publicly so it should know what kind of
phone I have right right kind of
and if you know what kind of phone I
have put regarding the chat in the chat
and before the AI releases let's see oh
it's it's oops I I mistyped oops
what kind of
I think
here is some details all right see the
tech voice based in Houston product
testing purpose of article about the day
in life
um that's another kind of phone I have
well I have an s22 plus let's see if you
guys got it yes Elia Smith says I'm
assuming do you have a Samsung yes I do
have a Samsung I have an s22 plus before
that I had an a715g which I sold on eBay
and this is also a Samsung laptop
okay
um
let's see what other questions we can
ask um
reading
how many clicks does it get a year we
get 20 to 35
000 20 000 35 000 clicks there's no
information about it of course but just
that
um okay let's ask it a uh
that uh do you have any questions you'd
like to ask the AI about me do I have
any tablets well
this is a tablet it's the Samsung Galaxy
book Flex Alpha oops so it flips around
and becomes a tablet oh and speaking of
tablets I am selling my guarantee book
uh
10.6 inch without the keyboard because
that's
wasn't spoken according 100 on eBay but
right now I can send you the links if
you might if you're interested in buying
that
so yes I do have a tablet and I'm trying
to sell it
it was the first device well one of the
devices I wrote did somebody written or
detective so
a piece of History right there
okay
um
it should be able to count them at a
person I have right uh no okay
well okay oh let's ask it one last
question and then we'll ask uh
we'll go to contribution questions
um
what is
and basic notice from the five fun facts
about me video I recorded in 2022 and
it
oh all right
we got some new information here
um but still wrong because Tech was a
customer tech website true I invented
that order about two months ago so glad
it's scraping that and detector starting
run from kid from Texas again two and
it's about just Tech Block based in
Houston I I think it is but
we say largest Christian Tech blog one
by team Houston for legal reasons
because
you know
only question
ah oh yep and the sources are from our
website and my keys for kids radio
interview and speaking of keys for kids
radio
I got my Audio Drama featured on audio
theater Central
that's right audio theater Central
featured little or me
uh on their podcast AI audio drama so
we're going to right there
we're going to listen to a search
snippet of what JD testing one two three
testing that was just me so for those of
you don't who don't know I created uh AI
Auto drama into at GP team
in Ben made this chat by using some free
voices online
AI voices online
you're talking I do that a lot where's
my speech how long are you gonna pour us
with this that's what I want to talk
about
so here's what I'm thinking
AI has been blowing up in the news and
you'll see you're seeing we understand
your desire but we just happened to
reach out right at the right time and so
I thought well let's talk about this
and I got their permission to play this
for you so it's only a few minutes I
think it's about four minutes long so
this is entirely written by Ai and
voiced by AI as well yeah
there's no music to it because I
couldn't download the thing you have to
pay like 29 a month uh ATC did provide
me a download link so I will try to add
music and sound effects to this to
create a more full production so this is
basically a beta version just voice only
so buckle up and let's take a listen to
this short Audio Drama and then let's
let's dissect this and we're not gonna
listen to the whole thing you can listen
to it on the podcast here
at the 36 43 minute Mark we're just
gonna hear the beginning and end
Mom Dad guess what I've been saving up
my money for months and I finally have
enough to buy the new game box 5000 game
summary he goes out buys it even though
his parents tell him not to
um it's kind of like taken permanent
personality script from the 1990s and he
scores down he returns its console
um
an act hard and saves up his money but
buys a game today my parents was raw and
I want to show them that I understand
that now Michael carefully packs up the
game console preparing to give it away
we reflect on this story let us remember
the words of Ephesians 6. I asked one
two three for children obey your parents
in the Lord for this is right honor your
father and mother which is the first
commandment with the promise so that it
may go well with you and that you may
enjoy long life on the Earth
okay so it obviously has no music no
sound effects I tried making some AI
music that didn't work well so
just the voices
but it's enough there to see where the
AI was going obviously it has a ton a
ton of issues now here is the prompt
that was given to chat GPT to write this
he said write me a 15-minute Christian
Audio Drama script that will give me a
story about a kid who works hard and
saves up his money but buys a game
console when his parents say no
so fairly specific
and they did say that there were three
or four other revision prompts to help
yeah I need to find it a little bit more
but obviously it still is uh very
lacking first of all the prompt was
write a 15-minute script
yeah that one voice was only
four and a quarter minutes
even if you add music and sound effects
it's probably only going to be about
five minutes so it was short by 10
minutes of what was requested
also where did this Mrs Johnson
character come from she just pops up so
if you listen to the item drama you'll
hear that see come she's the lady at the
what's it called the charity place so
that's where she comes from see suddenly
he's talking to her
and of course there are logical problems
like why take back the console that they
had gifted him but let him keep the one
that he bought
um the reason I had to do that was
because
it it's its own form of punishment like
he got the console for free from his
punishment from his parents but he takes
it away
and but they take it away from me which
means he wasted his money essentially
it was strange strange there
um you can keep it but you can't use our
electricity yeah that is kind of funny
funny but but there's some logic to this
and my school kids can bring like
broader console to school before you can
bring your console to uh
to home before besides the game box 5000
is it inherently specified what kind of
console to this so if it's a Nintendo
switch style console you can easily plug
it up at a friend's house buy your own
battery pack
generate your own electricity with a
windup think
um so it's kind of like forcing him to
like have a hard time using the console
as another for punishment it could also
be like a handheld battery powered one
we know it's never specified but
no electricity what is he supposed to do
if they're letting him keep it uh drag
an extension cord over two and of course
he can look at it as a monument to to to
to to what he did wrong but like his
parents this is an effective form of
punishment if you think about it his
parents would turn their console that
they bought for him right and they say
they can't use his electric electricity
which means he's not going to be able to
play it at the house when he wants to
he's gonna have to be able to play it I
got some friends house or put your
batteries in or the neighbor's house or
at school and he also wasted his I don't
know one two three four five hundred
dollars on on this console that he can
build you so it's an effective form of
punishment that reminds him of
what happened the neighbor's house and
used their electricity that's that whole
thing was just strange to me and it made
me laugh out loud and it wasn't supposed
to be funny
um I mean so
to be favored I was part of the prompt
um because that was my original ideas
for the Audio Drama
um
I just had this idea one day I was like
oh maybe I can get like on you if I like
make my own Audio Drama like you want to
Branch out
we did
lots and lots of issues here with this
script
it is interesting though that the prompt
specifically requested a Christian Audio
Drama yeah
and the narrator there at the end Works
in an actual scripture verse yeah I
asked
yes that was great and I'm
like if you listen to the audio kitchen
episodes there's more narration from
that lady so that's what I was trying to
go from I don't know what the lady's
name is it's another given but uh pretty
soon they know
and so the moral was there in the story
although again logical issues all the
way through I mean it was a logical
issue towards the internet to kind of
switch around but
Johnson
the fixed because
I gave it some more context but again if
it's more professionally produced I
guess I could add some sound effects of
him walking to Mrs Johnson's uh charity
or
maybe flesh off the punishment by saying
like you're spending your own money you
have to use your own electricity
because you disobeyed us
then we have this unnecessary narrator
who tells little things that are going
on throughout the story which could have
easily been shown
through
dialogue
true so obviously
using AI to just outright develop a
script for an audio drama is not a great
idea that's it and you can listen to
this whole thing we're gonna
keep dragging down delete the comments
uh
the comment should be on here somewhere
oh you have to touch that
didn't yeah scroll down
and I'm actually linked to
right there the tech boys blog I didn't
you can find my script script on the
software used with AI
and Grayson Rome says that I agree to
see the air out of drama story they sent
to me made into an apartment game big
after Christmas around the kids to keep
the money right we can use the
electricity I also need the AI moisture
table yes they are I use free voices I'm
not spending money on this project
um the son of the Boy Scouts I'm a girl
to me
true it was a boy it was a boy oh and
speaking of that um we'll see what
happens to my threads account and uh all
things different obviously podcast
sounds cool uh yeah okay so I'll try to
apply this comment like efficiently
and let me see if there's any other
comments talking about my
AI audio drama
there's some jokes like a i o yeah no AI
voices okay so
that's that
first ever Tech we're not going to be
featured on audio theater Central I'm
sure so that's that let's check Behavior
threats
let's see
it's still up okay I'm gonna repost
uh
okay
um let's keep moving on
uh
and again hello the Robert
and we're gonna close that tab
all right we're back we have probably
about 10 minutes left the podcast even
when you have anything that you'd like
to talk about
please put it in
oh oh of course I forgot about the other
tech one media properties
um don't forget we have the CC and audio
the audio the uh
what's it called
The Odyssey points
but of course it's more about Odyssey
it also is about
other things like
come on so the life at the pond is
releasing a streaming service life at
the front is releasing a streaming
service uh I'm going to try to commit to
an uh postal
math
to this website
um let me talk about Lacey being wrong
what happened in God's name in vain
that's the debate we can have
um on Kids Corner life at the barn again
launches of streaming service five times
a month to hear some unreleased episodes
it's over patreon
um he's trying to raise money to get new
a new 20 episode Pond season started so
if you want to support that of course
and do that by subscribing
and of course
xrtc have you
oh let's see have I ever tried
replicating a singer's voice
using RVC no I have not
um what single would you like me to
replicate
any what's that guy's name that
Christian singer Tommy
Tom
I'm right into music as you can tell uh
to me
I I forgot this guy's name I'm so sorry
um but
um you can drop this and go down to the
comp or chat and hey maybe I can be your
next live stream episode in fact after I
show off uh latest post which apparently
Ben and Jerry's wanted to um
Return Man to
indigenous people from something with
reason or whatever
um
yeah so remember to check this out we
have some tech textile posts this one
was generated by you.com not the post
but the headline
I created that one uh
and then of course just I went right
there
um
and of course
there's this one which I actually
created using the inspect tool which I
can make the same thing sort of pull
down
inspect
and we're gonna hit that
boom
big screenshot boom it's big okay so you
guys can check that out of course we'll
try to commit to I don't know post a
week
no okay so I'm going to check out
obviously but forget singers or BC
AI okay
according to Google's AI obviously it's
AI
is for a standard model three two
something okay let's see it's on GitHub
is this the right software uh what's
your name Ariel Smith
223 I've made a few voices interesting
but I believe it oh Chris Tomlin that's
the guy was talking about and that's
awesome I assume Ariel Smith is super
flying to the comet and Aaron Smith how
did you find us and um are you
subscribed you can put that in that's
why I keep looking at RBC
so I I don't know what zero zero one two
four seven five oh four means
but
okay
let's check out the demo video
it's in Chinese but okay
I wouldn't know if that's a good clone
or not I don't sing Chinese
uh Aerosmith says they use collab
okay I've tried to use a book collab
before it failed but I was able to help
someone out on the video it's one of my
most popular videos actually
um it's just a two minute video of me
showing how to change tensorflow versus
one detention by making a small thing on
the club and Aerosmith says he found it
um on uh Discord server
the software on my website
uh but back to
this you have to use Python 3.8 until
you use conspiracies but although I
didn't start if I had a terminal web UI
it's a tutorial or an obviously in
Chinese oh wow how helpful
um anyway so do you guys want me to try
this
I'll wait for Aerosmith two two three
two answer the question if he wants me
to try it then maybe we can try next
episode
all right probably last about five more
minutes
um
let's see oh oh let's get over to Matt
the Bing I'm gonna keep this screen up
for right now and keep moving on
[Music]
and I'll just go check to see
if
it's actually quite simple
oh the software is quite simple okay
the hardest part is getting samples from
singers
um can I just screen record the uh
Let's Go the music videos would that
work
I can help you out in the Discord if you
want
um sure
in fact
we could
if I could I could bring you on the show
depending on what you're on the schedule
if you wanted
oh no oh no I forgot I'm supposed to be
interviewing uh what's his name today he
didn't email me back though so maybe I
can do it next week but
sure okay
um
he says it's quite easy that's
interesting let's see uh
meta and we're going to close out
uh
okay it says Facebook is coming with a
yeah all right here we go Facebook is
coming out with the Twitter competitive
it's called threads
Twitter is going to be copycatting
things
um so is that
and then the last and then Essentials
people of unapproved thoughts so we'll
see how fast my sister I'm doing that
account because like it's kind of
useless to me and let's see we have to
do about three more minutes of the
podcast of Ariel Smith oh really uh
Roberts if any of you have any questions
oh say power if any more questions Eric
Smith says he'll message me on Discord
thank you Aaron Smith
um
any questions to see if I have any
comments or concerns oh you guys are
still seeing the site
okay
here we go
all right next time
no comments no concerns right now so we
have basically like two minutes left of
the podcast
see if you can get this right to an hour
let me pull this up oh don't forget to
buy me okay oh I'm a breast I'm a
reading about this you have to find
archipelines for the singers if you want
I saw an article that says the software
that takes the music app I'd actually
did that to God is in control by Kids
Corner
oh I calm this is voice so I I found
software free software online that lets
you upload the song from you can extract
the music so I could that sing along
in Texas thinking app or I can take all
the music
[Music]
yeah so yeah very easy to do that I've
done that before and
um One Last Time buy me a coffee with
the techboy.org remember to watch our
new thing break up the footage or
destroy the footage and PC mag and that
other Tech website we talked about last
week to have
weird phrases like non-min which is
weird and of course to check out our
website at techware.org we'll get back
to uh
two to three posts a day of course we're
busy we had no phone until Friday
for Monday so if there's that and of
course you can follow me at techboy org
and remember to like And subscribe to
talk to you later
um we're just going to keep this up for
a minute later I'm going to fast sweep
transition out so if you don't have any
more questions or comments or concerns
um I'm gonna push this button at the one
minute no at the at the 57 second Mark
which is gonna swoosh and that's of
course when it comes into the comment of
the Urgent question and you really need
help or something like that everybody
push that by another 57 seconds mark
because then I had to push the invite
guys oh gotta comment gotta comment uh
okay I think I'm gonna head off for now
I had fun I'll message you later have
good night my friend good night and God
bless AO Smith and thank you for
watching for this long thank you for
being paid loyal listener all right and
we almost are done
I feel good
