<h1>TheTechBoy Podcast Episode 14</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the this week in
the tech boy podcast all right I'm gonna
make it nice and short
um let's get into it
all right
um first of all on the 7th of November
which was five days ago um we did the
review of
khcb.org KGB is a great Christian radio
station
um they uh they play great but
um sorry audio dramas they play uh music
put just good programs
um
but they recently did a website redesign
and I reviewed it
um it's pretty good they're pretty just
a few little um
slight problems but overall it's good
um please go beat with you now on to the
Vault smart blog review
um I said they're doing good but a bit
inconsistent the um app didn't really
give me as many features as I was
expecting well I mean I have some
expecting that many features but it um
didn't really work as well as I expected
but I mean for twenty dollars a two pack
uh
um
plug you can just turn on off vacation
mode
um it depends on the features that are
important to you if all you want to do
is time to turn stuff off remotely and
make stuff turn on and off
um
like pretending that you're at home into
vacation mode I just hit you goodbye but
if you want something more reliable then
do that then get drunk at that okay
these are our most property posts

on doing good Quality Reporting I need
more people to come to the website

um I'm gonna let you see the stats
um but I like to have more diversity
across the pages
