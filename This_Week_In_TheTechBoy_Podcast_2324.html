<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 2324</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
this week in the Tech booy podcast um
plenty happened in technology this week
the I I mean iPod Apple Vision Pro came
out
um oh there's a new advent Odyssey
episode that I still have not listen to
so we'll get to that after the
podcast um I got new batteries for my
walkie-talkies so
that you know made it better I guess and
then of course the
iPhone Apple something was doing
something soon let me see what it was
doing then 1+ 12 is coming
up so let's talk about the on+ 12 in
more
depth
but before we get to the 1pl 12 let's go
to the tech boy.org
which will be having its four year
that's right foury year anniversary this
year in 2024 found it in
2020 um
so the website come on come on it's
loading
all right here we are so our most
popular articles are the you know normal
popular articles M8 versus
M7 Instagram thing you know the usual
plus but we did review the pesu M no not
the PES Pesco G5 and the pesu
radio this a pretty good radio right
here $112 it's a travel radio yeah so
let's talk about this radio here okay so
this radio it's $12 it's a travel radio
you have an arm strap on it okay you
type in here you have the volume here
let me just give you a
simple uh demonstration so I'm going to
have to mute this for copyright reasons
until we get to like
non okay here's just
the
that's just the MP3 player then you
switch over to the FM
radio it supports this recent creation
that Genesis teaches and that the
prophets and the New Testament Apostles
also taught and believed well we've got
this amazing evidence and it's going on
right inside each of our bodies pretty
good audio quality on F am
and uh MP3 playing there and I wasn't
able to pick up anything on shortwave
but I'm pretty sure it does well too
speaking of shortwave but a different
type of shortwave shortwave email client
we reviewed years ago is getting a it's
getting better it's getting
AI um because you know everything is
including AI
nowadays I so I guess we can talk about
that it's called the smartest email app
on planet Earth here it is
so you got the shortwave AI assistant
you can summarize stuff based upon your
emails here and it is apparently in
plenty of companies including X Roblox
Spotify and indeed okay you got AI
executive assistance analyze email
history and Etc I'm pretty sure have to
pay for all of this because it only was
able to index like 90 worth of email for
free so it's probably not going to be
that useful with only 90 days worth of
email you get high quality translations
which that's pretty useful um you can
schedule
meetings and then of course the normal
uh inbox tabbing system that we talked
about
okay here we go who's the OnePlus 12
riew nkpd is apparently not reviewing it
I could care less I mean if OnePlus you
know wants to send that phone my way you
know that would be fine okay here we
go so let's see here curv screen which
I'm happy about okay black back glass
and large size I mean that's it's pretty
good I mean the only Con on this list is
the back glass of slippery how can you
already have an award for this I me they
use build install it
February a time of tape okay let let's
see
here all right this design is pretty
good though some people would rather
have it in the center because then it
wouldn't
wobble so I don't know how you would
feel about
that okay in the screen it's one of the
best screens on the planet 4,500 Nets
okay so I mean I don't know a scenario
in which you access that but maybe you
say 3,00 2,700 Niche right definitely on
a hot summer day in Houston Texas you
know it would it get hot and you need to
see so that's that okay and of course
has the highest quality display with the
1440 by 300 3,168 pixel resolution so
it's just it's a sh step shy of the uh
Sony phones which have 4K displays I
mean 510 pixels per inch better than s24
Ultra better than s24 plus okay 120 H
refresh rate I mean that's almost as
good as you can get I mean they could
about 165 HS on it but that would
honestly be Overkill and then HDR plus
and vision right I it's basically a
great display I mean the only better
things so they could Adventure is make
it 4K and have it 165 refresh rate but
it's not a gaming phone or Creator phone
so I mean that is the best thing that
they could do to it I mean it's better
than Samsung's it's better than
apple and then if it has an auto refresh
rate which means it's going to figure
out what the best refresh rate is based
on what you're doing so let's say you're
are swiping on Tik Tok for whatever
reason right and it's probably going to
be 120 but let's say that you looking at
a picture on Instagram it's probably
going to be at 30 or 60 HZ okay you can
also set Refresh on app by app basis
which kind of makes sense like you might
want to have your phone app set to 10
HS and then say your browsing
application so you can browse to
tech.org or you can even use officeal
app APK
uh at 120
HZ now the performance seems like it be
optimal but I mean I have a super super
demanding schedule every Friday I make
News videos for my school right so that
that involves plugging in using an
external microphone uh as actually
camera I'm filming this on U the mic
it's better than my phone
mic connecting external microphone to my
phone in filming and phone mode which
gets it hot but then I have to edit into
Luma fusion and short cut mobile right
um which also gets my phone even harder
and drains my battery even more so that
seems like it' be a great test I mean
and somehow for some reason we film at
60 frames per second I'm going to turn
that off I me S on the projector at 720p
okay so I can just change it to 30
frames per second safe storage
um might want to keep it though because
it would compensate for the lag when it
get streamed to the
projectors um yeah so
at 720p not 720p so we're filming in
basically 1080p right 60 frames per
second let me see what are my PR mode
settings in Pro mode right so it's
honestly using lot of battery and I
import these high resolution clips into
my phone's video editor application
let's see oh wow we are filming in 4k
60 let me show this to you
guys so these are the settings that we
use we
use we filming 4K 60 that is insane that
is why my phone is running out of
storage okay um anyway we filming 4K 60
so that's just kind of I do here and
then I have to edit this stuff on Luma
fusion and when I import all these 4K
clips into a timeline I mean I'm
talking like clip after clip or maybe
two clips one on top of each other plus
the graphics to go into the screen and
then export and I go put
the little news ticker at the bottom you
can see how we do that in article onch
boy.org that's where the thing came from
um
yeah so that is a stress test on the
phone I mean it
is it is a stress test it gets hot it
starts lagging and cutting some stuff
becomes unresponsive so I want to see if
the OnePlus 11 I mean yeah 12 and the
s24 ultra could handle my workload
because my s24 s22 plus can barely keep
up I'm going to see if it can if the
battery light can keep up like if it's
not going to shoot it down from 50 m 50
uh% to 20% over the course of filming
and editing or if it won't lag out of
luma fusion and shot cut and motion
ninja and all these video editing
applications I just want to
see so this is Contender for the video
editing champion of the
year is the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip 512
GB of storage so I me I mean we could
film in 4k all day so it wouldn't really
matter okay 16 GB of RAM which would be
which was important for how many
applications you have open and then of
course you can use 12 gigs of extra Ram
because storage but I mean that's kind
of
useless and then you got Android 14 and
oxygen OS that apparently reminds this
rid of Google pixel phones okay now the
other gripe I have of my Samsung phone
right now is I'm going to load a
stopwatch
here it takes so long to switch from
video um from photo to video application
right here okay so I'm going to start
the stopwatch hopefully you can see it
I'm going to click the button that says
video at the same time that I click
Start one minute so one second 1.9
seconds basically two seconds right I
mean plenty can happen in 1.2 seconds
1.9 seconds right is also the same
problem I have with this watch here
which unfortunately I had to keep
because apparently it's standard amongst
all watches of this
genre like who
thought and Samsung thanks to them they
got this fixed on s24 Ultra I don't know
if it's like this on OnePlus 12 but I've
used some OnePlus phones before and it's
never done that so congratulations to
OnePlus for having this camera like
issue but who thought okay so we got
this spy watch here right instead of
having on and you just snap a
picture no let me stay here while
someone is robbing the bank hold this
button
here three seconds oh okay okay now let
me aim this here click the button boom
oh wait no that's audio Boop okay that's
photo like why why would you do that you
just have it click launch from the home
screen I mean at least on Samsung you
can just from any screen go push the
button twice and it's going to load the
photo app and then click video it's
going to take a long time it took me
like 10 seconds yesterday because I all
these apps open in the background and
you just click that volume button boom
you had your picture taken I mean it's
it's it's insane it's annoying so
hopefully the OnePlus 12 has that uh
fixed okay so hopefully you can see this
on the screen we got the OnePlus 12 back
up here with the snapon agent 3 okay can
split screen which I'm happy about I
mean it looks the same as Samsung split
screen technology if you zoom in here
you can see the three dots so that's
good okay so let's this person use it to
check his email social media messages on
teams which I mean that's basically
Android I mean sorry Samsung EG A1
capability right there so I mean
whatever watching Disney plus and taking
photos and videos now okay that's fine
but the way I take photos and videos
different what he's probably talking
about he's probably SP right we're
talking basically like high
quality I mean this could potentially be
a YouTube channel of amateur news if it
was like you know not School news
because I mean way that we run it I mean
close to 5 minute videos where of course
more like
17 15 minutes clips that they get to get
deleted because mess ups and stuff so I
mean that is J CH two storage a
bunch it also has I'm also glad that it
doesn't lag or stutter between
applications that is so annoying when I
try to switch between applications which
also has fixed on 24 Ultra apparently so
that's good and then in screen
fingerprint scanner is good apparently
okay so that's good and then you have
graphically intensive gaming that works
well
so that's great I don't
game and it gets four years a software
update so that's you know that's pretty
good I mean that's industry standard now
I mean two years ago hey great for you
but Samsung gives seven Apple gives six
five I don't know if they give they
don't have a set number and then Google
also giv seven so whatever all well I
mean I wouldn't use my phone for seven
years the same one I
mean I got this when it was new well six
months old but when it was still a cur
series of Samsung phones so that mean
I'd have to wait till the s29 to get a
new phone which wouldn't
happen
now when you get to the camera you got a
50 megapixel main 60 megapixel Periscope
teleph camera three times optical zoom
which they should really call that a
periscope a periscope camera is meant
for you know
10 you know five 15 times three times T
photo lens I mean that's basically just
s20 s20 level technology from four years
ago that's not a periscope techn uh
camera all right then we got a 48
megapixel Ultra wide camera which is
pretty good most people don't really
care about the ultra camera so I'm glad
to see a higher megapixel rating here
I'm not sure about what the center size
is because that's important to get for
light because if an ultra right camera
if it has like you know small amounts of
light coming into it and you have to
spread it out among 0.56 times that's
not really good and a 32 megapixel
selfie camera it's whatever okay I mean
I can't think of the last time I've
actually used my selfie
camera uh maybe a few months ago for my
YouTube shorts
okay so of course during the day the
photos are true real life and realistic
which I mean you got say that in your
phone for the past five years it's fast
at capturing images which I'm so glad
about we're coming let's start let's do
the stopwatch again so I'm going to show
here all right let's reset the stopwatch
okay okay my photo screens
up
oh sorry sorry let's try that
again
057 what see is it
Bluey no okay but let's say I take a
picture and I went back there I mean
that's so okay I'm looking at my camera
I move it
and it looks like it's gotten better but
the one thing that hasn't gotten better
is this lag this lag is annoying like I
have my phone I'm clicking to to look at
the image I've already taken oh wow okay
look I think it's a little bit BL look
for SEC example okay let's reset the
stopwatch
okay okay I want to go back to the
camera app and to see the
camera about um one sec 1.3 seconds to
go from your
image and then go back I mean Samsung's
lag is just annoying I mean look look
look at
this
okay there's there's my image there go
back that took so
long and it always happens at the worst
time someone's beating up someone right
there oh I'm got to get my camera up oh
no it's taking a long time oh my
goodness like it always happens during
important moments for some reason it's
just it's just like that okay so I'm
glad that OnePlus 12 can do that better
okay like this is a objectively hard
image to get because the bubbles will be
moving they will be popping right looks
very Bluey but I mean okay here we
go I don't know what this is I mean that
H this might be compression but these
images don't look that good look look
what is that it's probably
compression okay it also has houseold
enhancements which means you got to get
like some weird fter or whatever that's
great Ed attack and hit a Miss portrait
photos I could kill L about Edge
detection and for photos because like
for halil but I mean I guess you could
see the P for this like that leaf is is
out of focus there and as it's supposed
to
be I'm not sure if it's part of this
Leaf here or Leaf underneath
it is supposed to a
portrait I don't know if that's a
portrait but
okay does take good photos of Lowa
images so that's good and at 64
megapixel telephoto that's good I can
understand why they use a three time
shooter because then they can like cop
in and claim has Optical six time Z but
still I'd rather have a five and a three
but I mean it is cheaper than the s23
ultra so for so it needs to compromise a
little bit and then Master mode which I
guess is what it's called Pro mode here
in the battery life here 4,000 million
hour was larger in the s24 ultra though
it doesn't have an S spin to compensate
for it though I think studies showed
that like taking the headphone jack out
of
the S like from the note 9 to the note
10 added an nextra 100 m hours battery
so I'm not sure if having a stylus
really takes up that much battery
besides the s24 to last a really long
time about two days this one last two
days I really like to see battery test
between the OnePlus uh 12 and the s24
that would be really interesting I mean
the OnePlus 12 might last a we bit
longer but the s24 ultra might last a
little bit shorter only because it's a
bit more powerful because it has some of
those AI features in the cloud which of
course lots of data usage and then of
course it's always I guess searching for
an
spin like when you hover over the screen
and stuff like that and of course
battery uh depends on what settings you
put here like do you put it at Max
brightness you put it at the s204 ultas
max brightness which would be like a few
nits below like two doz nits below the
OnePlus 12 smack brightness
Etc
and then of course the charging speed
completely good but I like to see how it
holds up after like say three four years
we trying to like sell the phone on eBay
or pass it down to a child or something
like that like when it's done with it
software support but you still want to
you know hold on to it um it's cap at 80
Watts here in the United States I'm not
sure if that's a law I don't think it's
a law but it might just Beed electric
speed here but I'm like when you go from
say 45 to 80 it's a bigger job saying
going watch to 100 watch because if you
go to 100 watch that just means you're
going to hit that cap where it has to
limit the charging down to like 50 or 45
or 20 or whatever to keep the battery
safe faster so
it's counter two I
guess but I mean 80 Watts gets you to 12
minutes so I mean that's good though I
should put a prequisite is with the
prebuilt charger so it's not like you
can just connect to any device
yeah yeah um so 12 minutes get you 50%
charge that's basically like changing
the battery of a phone essentially and
then 30 minutes gets to 100% so I
mean it's pretty good if you think about
it I mean
that's
like a sixth of a class period in my
school
so it also has 10 watt with first
wireless charging and what so that's
good for earbuds and other
phones so this looks like a really good
phone I mean if Samsung break this phone
I would be all over it
um but I already like I mean I want to
buy this phone right now I just don't
have the 700 and something dollars I
mean it would be a great upgrade for me
s22 plus um it has all the great specs I
just miss out on Dix and prob
potentially Dex but it may support
Androids built-in desktop mode which is
like work in
progress
and says it has competition from the
pixel 8 which like it's two different
types of phones pixel 8 is more like e
AI software and uh the pixel 8 and the
OnePlus 12 is like Pro strength which
right now I think BR strength is going
to win because like I mean some of those
AI things are good but I mean they're
going to eventually come to the cloud
some point I mean what the Google pixel
can do with AI in terms of gener
generating images and wallpapers I'm
pretty sure they have separate apps for
that I mean I'm pretty sure there's an
image editing application we can move
someone up two inches or I'm pretty sure
that you
can uh generate your own wallpapers with
AI I mean there is literally a robot
that is powered by chat GPT and your
smartphone okay I'm pretty sure that you
can generate your own wallpapers AI
besides I mean you could just go into
any like random AI tool like Microsoft
Paint which now has AI in it which it's
interesting actually I can pull that up
right now Microsoft Paint can generate
generate images stupid
laptop oh my
gosh all right here we go paint is
coming up on the screen and I can just
say generate a phone wallpaper that okay
here we go split
screen
okay I'm going to share it on the screen
right now so stop
present all right here we go here's
Microsoft Paint Microsoft Paint you can
just say generate an image
of
and you get credit this right now I have
45
credit and you can choose your style
which I forgot to choose a style but
whatever I mean you can just generate
your own wallpaper like this anyway
and while it's loading I mean it's
connected
in there you can edit them yourself in
paint and I'm pretty sure that there are
phone applications that can do this boom
right there okay let's just make
this there you go voila it's a phone
wallpaper actually like this one right
here boom there you have it people your
very own phone wallpaper and then you
can do your regular paint edits in it
like
fill you can delete
it and then draw a rectangle around it
and then turn it
white that
wa there you go
white now has a white line to
it so yeah I
mean there's plenty you can do with your
Microsoft Paint
to offut the loss of your wallpaper
maker from Samsung or
Google and then of course s24 which I
mean is not as spe as the OnePlus 11 I
has a smaller screen less Ram Less
storage probably better cameras I'm not
sure I mean the megapixels but of course
you got to think about
the what's it called Center
sizes and software
support let's see how much are they
selling I mean they are overpriced on
eBay I
think like cuz they're coming direct
from China so I saw one for $2,400 I
said m not
happening okay let's see then we got to
do our YouTube
segment
okay YouTube
reaction
time all my feed is talking about the
Apple verion Pro we'll get to that
later let's do Tech Odyssey one of my
favorite tech YouTubers review of the
s24
ultra
I've had this baby for a week now been
using it SIM card in it testing it out
and I need to put a SIM card in it I
have some thoughts is it any good yeah
it's a good phone so if that's what you
wanted to know you can sign off and go
grab some donuts and enjoy your evening
but from a a couple different levels
this phone has been interesting because
basically it's like last year's phone
the s23 ultra which I have right
here but they put a new chip in it and
they changed a couple things up so it's
got the Snapdragon 8 Generation 3
instead of the snap dragon 8 generation
2 which was a beloved processor this
last year it was probably the best chip
that we may have ever seen up to this
point it's yeah was a pretty good
processor H and
one over heating issu so annoying it was
just so good so they basically took that
chip and then they beefed it up in the
AI department but then they gave us AI
features with the phone which I don't
really think take advantage of that too
much but anyway so yeah I wish one of
them were less cloudbased and more on
device based it really push those scores
to their limit got Circle to search and
we've got the I mean Circle to search
it's just like taking the screen side
search again I
mean Generation stuff where we can do
different things there they they had to
come up with their own name instead
of Magic Eraser or magic editor and well
most of that stuff is done on the cloud
it's funny because there were a lot of
criticisms that the pixel 8 Pro and
pixel8 got because oh it does this on
the cloud and then Samsung does the same
thing and there's not a peep like not
one single peep like I nobody is
nobody's bashing them for it nobody's
talking about it well I mean I can't hit
in the cloud so Tech Odyssey if you're
watching this here's your peep I just am
sensitive this because I'm a big
advocate for the pixel series phones but
anyway so the AI Department I I think
the pixel8 pro is still King in the AI
department but it's nice to see some of
those features trickle over to the s24
Ultra battery life has been okay I think
it's still better on the s23 ultra by
just a little bit but the always on
display is it burns up quite a bit of
battery on here just in my last charging
interesting I barely use it like the
only thing you could say is always on on
my phone is the battery percentage and
the like when it's charging recyle
like always on display which is this
that's the always on display I mean you
could always turn off and go back to the
normal one H basically they copied Apple
but it's not as good as the one apple
has at least by most people's metrics I
think it's fine I I kind of like not
looking at a black background with a
couple of icons on it so we're kind of
at that point now where a lot of these
features that used to kill the battery
life and would just like turn it off
turn it on make a battery optimization
video things like that we have such good
enough processors and good enough
battery and good enough battery
management that it's not really a killer
anymore yeah it took 9% of my battery
but the phone still lasts all day so
that's the big litness test for me I
don't care if a phone can last two days
I don't care if it can last three days I
care if I can have all the features
turned on I can do what I want and it
lasts me all day and I feel pretty
comfortable with that so that was
something I was curious about like did
did the Snapdragon 8 gener I wonder if
we can run Nimbo PC
emulator Generation 3 and some of these
features kind of drain the battery a
little bit more and they do but that's
okay because I think the battery still
lasts all day I just got to the one we
Mark so I'll give you a full accounting
on the battery life when I do my full
review in a week I two weeks is about a
good time frame for this two weeks using
every I think I spent two to three weeks
with my Cosmo
Communicator day daily driving it
testing it out I I feel like that's a
pretty good way that you can say okay
this is this is what I think of the
phone and that's how I typically do
business but using this one I feel
pretty good about the battery I wish
they bump it up though we saw that we
got about a 500 milliamp bump on the
OnePlus 12 and about 4,000 actually be
nice if we kind of got that with Samsung
I mean why do we have to keep sticking
with 5,000 m we had a 5,000 milliamp
battery for years in these phones so
pretty good it does last I guess
samate it would be nice if they would
bump it up a little bit they change the
camera it doesn't have the 10 times
telephoto anymore a lot of people really
like the 10 times telephoto that we had
on the S2 they'll probably bring it back
to s25 you know just add a six camera 22
Ultra it's a five times now which I
actually think is better and I don't
really think that you get much drop off
if at all in the super zoom Department
the 100 times Zoom I did a YouTube short
video today which you can check out I'll
put a link in the description you can
check that out and see it still works
pretty good I think it does everything
it needs to do at that 100 times Zoom
range but with this you can get better
portrait shots you can get better
intermediary shots most people are more
apt to take a picture of their dog there
significant other a cool car they see
some food on their table then they are
using a 100 times Zoom I mean
well I guess I'm not most people you
know I always take pictures of drones
flying in the
sky yeah know it's a cool novel te but
in reality I'd rather be able to take
three times it's pretty cool you can
like a five times portrait shot I think
that's pretty cool because sometimes you
don't just want to do hey portrait shot
one times and that's what you get so I I
do think it's thoughtful I like well I
mean you can do three times portrait
shot at least on my phone I think the
Arsenal is better there and that mirrors
more what you see with a lot of other
phones like the iPhone 15 Pro Max five
times telephoto you look at the pixel 8
Pro five times telephoto you look at the
continuous Zoom that you get with the
Optical on the Sony xer 1 Mark 5 and
it's like what 3.8 to 5.2 if I remember
off the top of my head very close to
that so there's been kind of a shift and
okay close close photos we got them far
photos we got them let's kind of lock in
this intermediary space what about
seven plus you can still do you know the
8K video and all that stuff I don't know
that I've ever shot well I take that
back I did do an 8K video I believe it
was with the note 20 Ultra and the S21
Ultra I think those are the first times
I ever did it and I don't really do 8K
what are you going to watch it on right
well you might think that but when it
comes to the 8K what you can do is you
can crop that down and it gives you like
a really high quality good pixel density
on a 4K video so there's just some
thoughtful things you can do there
that's nice I still think that the
Samsung phone has the best built-in
microphones I shot the same YouTube
short video I was talking about and I
recorded it with the native microphone
outside there was some like wind and
noise and things going on the Samsung
microphones always impressed
me Jorge has always put the ones he
loves first but when it comes to caring
for his teeth he
what the iPhone one not so much the
pixel one that's all right Samsung I
think they have the best mic I guess I
guess we're saying Samsung's the best
phone for
creators comes to shooting video on
their phones and you can shoot a video
with this phone you can shoot a portrait
Style video for your Tik toks and your
YouTubes and your Instagram re and all
that stuff don't need an external
microphone and it comes out really good
so I like that stuff again you got the
AI features that's cool I don't I don't
think it's that big of a selling point I
I think the flat screen was a big
selling point I think the seven years of
security patches and updates that's a
selling point I
think yeah the Spen is a good selling
point I I think saying you've got
titanium in the frame that can be a
selling point AI I I did like a poll
kind of I asked people about their
thoughts and their feelings because
Samsung thought there was a big increase
in sales because people wanted the AI
features and I'm like I don't think
that's it Chief and most people were
like I wanted the flat screen and I have
a lot of mix feelings about that I love
the curved Edge display on the s23 ultra
and going to the flat Ed like the flat
screen it's okay it's not going to cause
me not to buy the phone like I'm not
saying anything bad about it I just I
just wish to use that 2.5d glass that
they used on the s20 that would have
been nice for the curved Edge display
and it's funny because it still has
rounded edges so it has the rounded
edges here but it has a flat display I
kind of like how it just flowed into the
curve of the phone but anyway doesn't do
that anymore but yeah just using it on a
day-to-day basis I I been using the S
Pen I've been using it more because I
rest in peace lost my S Pen for my zold
5 I think it might have just popped off
the back of my case somewhere I I don't
know it's just gone uh and I was using
my fold five to make all of my
thumbnails coms and now I've been using
the Z sorry the S2 2 ultra4 ultra is B
complete of aone so that's a address
Jana uh uh cheaper than
Apple yeah usually a bit brand name yeah
that is what makes it expensive oh
speaking of
um so yeah if you have any Tech
questions feel free to ask them here
hello phon as you can get if you're not
hung up on it not having a charger it
doesn't have expandable storage and it
does my goodness it's been three years
since we launched that petition and
like 15 three something people signed it
I mean come on the people want to
hear doesn't have a headphone jack that
stuff I really like Sony for I love my
Sony X One Mark 5 I those phones are too
narrow two years of software support too
expensive and not really sold in
carriers over the
US
yeah I
mean well yeah but people have
been you know well not that many people
signed it uh we did have a kind of qua
successful petition called cancel to
Verge you can sign it if you
want
here it
is we've been boycotting them ever
since sometimes and I put an SD card in
it and I can record straight to that or
I can copy it over I can plug in my nice
microphone I've got a really nice boom
microphone that I plugged into it the
videos I've recorded uh I just wish you
could record and put in an external SSD
that would be nice because that would
make it so much easier when I record Rec
my
News
videos like I know this is an SSD but
like I have this flash drive on a
keychain basically and it records 120 it
has 128 gigabyt of storage if I could
film those News videos on today it would
be so much better because then I
wouldn't be clogging up my phone storage
with a bunch of bloopo in
4k with my Sony xer 1 Mark 5 most folks
like man it looks way better and it
sounds better than my iPhone and I agree
with that as well I might try and shoot
a video with this one and see how it
pans out so if you're interested to have
me record one of my normal videos and
see how it looks with this phone let me
know in the comment section I'm fairly
certain some of y'all want to see that
uh so yeah let me know but I'll I'll
just plan on making that anyway but yeah
video capability is good picture
capability is good the shutter speed has
increased and that's something that's
nice because it's been a big criticism
and complaint over the last well
basically forever Samsung always has a
problem with this I was taking some
photos of my dog and like you can see
the shutter speed is
pretty oh yeah those donations don't
even go to the company they go to
change. work I wouldn't donate if yeah
the donations are stupid I mean like if
you actually want to to donate we have
our own
link good and this is with the maximum
AI enhancement turned on on the camera
they came out with a few with oneui 6
where you could speaking of oneui 6 or
whatever Bixby is looking so much better
and I think I'm not sure but the voice
got better and fast so I guess we can
talk about
thatjust how much processing you want it
done and that was kind of I think people
felt was delaying the shutter and well
in many ways obviously so because if you
turn it down Samsung like look you can
get faster photos but it's GNA have less
processing it's going to be more of a I
I don't want to say the word raw because
it's not a raw exported photo or video
it is just raw eyes and not being
process not being held up with the with
the postprocessing and the computational
photography so really more relying on
the sensor than anything but you could
take faster shots so I guess you could I
guess that might be better if you don't
want your trees look like super green
because that's the way Samsung's
postprocessing
Works which has been a criticism because
people that have pets people that have
small children that they want to take
photos of sometimes it get blurred out
images like because they turn move right
as you're trying to take a photo so the
pixels and the iPhones have been better
historically well there's been a
definite update there's been a good
upgrade on here where I've been able to
hopefully they can push that update to
the 23 22 other new as well the
difference other people I've got
feedback from it said there's a
difference here look it's add for the
phone maybe the pixel and the iPhone are
still a little bit faster but I think
they've done some good things there uh
the color itself uh I like it what is
that blue titanium I said before it
looks like a paint sample I made a
comment before that made some people
upset because I said that it was
uninspiring I was talking about the way
that the phone looks let me take the
case off of my S2 oh it's in a case okay
if you didn't know what the colors were
and you just had to go into it blind
you're like all right which one is which
they look basically identical are you
kidding me okay to it blind like all
right which one and if you notice here
the flash icon here is bigger than the
flash right here okay the zoom light
thing it doesn't even look as depressed
there and you have the titanium railings
here which is going to be the same on
all 24 Ultras because it's made out of
titanium and this is the same color as
the phone which is pink so I mean there
are there are key differences that you
can see here also this is way more
curved I mean look how much more curved
that is than this is
what do you
think is which they look basically
identical from the back they have fully
100% adopted Apple strategy of make the
same looking phone in it and just resell
it the next year there's really all
we're getting is improvements to cameras
and AI at this point AI is basically the
big selling point this year Google kind
of started with the pixel 8 now
Samsung's jumping on board I think it'll
get better over time but my concern is
how many of them will be phone specific
and how many of them will be like
product line specific for instance you
take a look at the pixel 8 Pro it's
clearly getting more AI features than
the pixel 8 and then the pixel 7 Pro and
6 Pro aren't really getting those
features either even though their tensor
chip was supposed to be better for AI
and machine learning they're very much
limiting a lot of that to that line what
happens when we get the pixel 9 Pro is
it going to cut off the pixel 8 Pro and
not give all those features are you
going to have to keep buying the new one
every year so that's with Samsung with
their AI will they have a continuity
with the phone that follows it where as
the years go by it will continue to get
those updates and that's one of the
powers of having AI That's done on the
phone and on the cloud because as long
as you have those updated I'm so ready
for on device AI
we yeah we tested out on device Ai and
it was so slow but I am ready for the
potential like let's say I had a better
phone with more RAM and AI is it could
have been it could have been great I'm
ready for chat TBT online Cloud servers
in the background that gives you the the
legs and the longevity for that to be
able to continue to use those that's
what hurts older phones and also you
know like Google I wouldn't trust Google
to uh keep their AI servers up for more
than 10 years there's an entire website
talked
about uh talking about what's it called
the the the Google's giving up projects
like Google ad Google Hangouts Google
Talk
Google I don't know what else theyve
given of uh oh Google Nexus Google
um I'm pretty sure they gave up on one
smart speaker Google tablet and then
brought back the tablet and then gave up
on tablets and then brought back the
tablet so yeah okay so we'll just put a
pause on that with you here we got gab
AI here gab AI from that social media
website that's unentered or whatever um
you don't need to sign up for it it's
kind of interesting it's supposed to be
uncentered or whatever but it is it is
it it has no cont continuity
okay watch
this I don't know
uh
so then you ask the question
to
area Okay so it gives you these
questions here and I are so boring
okay it actually it fixed the continuity
problem but I was doing I trust Google
this isn't chat GPT it's more
like chat GPT and Google are not run by
the same people they're run by two
completely different people actually
it's bought by Microsoft and this is Gab
GPT which is the uncensored
Freedom uh AI it's just not as good as
Google and chat GPT because obviously
they don't have that much data on which
to
compile um but
then uh like I asked it since ch gbt and
Google B are so annoying okay they are
so annoying about censoring every single
thing we do on the AI thing like I ask
it like how to trace a cell phone oh
well I can't tell you because privacy
legal reasons oh okay I say how can I
trace a Rockie talkie well you know you
might want to contact the
FCC oh my gosh like please just tell me
how to trace my own
walkie-talkies but this uncentered AI
which like it's bad at understanding the
context of questions like if I ask it
how to trace a
phone it actually tells me how to do
it maybe it actually tells me how to do
it
but
but
it it um gives This legal message at the
BT whatever it actually gives me a way
to do it but okay it says use GPS
tracking which I mean duh if I knew
where a phone was and had a link to
it why would I even sitting here and
asking you use IMEI number which I'm not
even sure if that works okay third party
tracking apps which we went over these
in like
what few months ago about how I never
even heard have watched how dumb those
apps were and like how they basically
outw but whatever and then find my
iPhone but what and then use do mobile
curies okay let say how
to how to trace phone via
number wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa man we got lots of comments here
well I personally think most things are
monopolized and if all news all fund
them all work together well technically
chpt and Google or uh what they called
competitiv like one is has one has shars
and Microsoft and then Google of course
has shars
alphabet CHP chat GPT does not give me
an answer if I ask that question
according to my uh legal reasons I can't
tell you power because it's an invasion
of privacy and a breach of consent I'm
like oh my gosh okay but then if I tell
it um how to do it with phone number
reverse phone lookup surfaces okay I can
guarantee you that if you go on white
pages.com and type in my phone number
right uh I mean sure it's cool that it's
unscented and stuff but I mean its
answers are garbage okay um we got my
first phone lookup service that cannot
trace a phone number okay I guarantee it
social media also will not trace a phone
number contacting the mobile carrier
which may or may not work but of course
you
know if you're trying to look for your
phone or whatever um and you need a
password password or whatever okay third
party tracking which you cannot install
on a flip phone and then through legal
means of course then the government can
do it but like how can they do it like
ismi catches and stuff which I'm sorry
but I don't have $15,000 and I search
one to find my own phone
okay
um let's see how
to okay I wna I want to see what the
answer about
this okay okay okay okay okay we got
this we got this hey this this might
actually be good this might actually be
good okay okay so I got my SDR right
here okay I actually have one okay you
need an SDR that can receive and process
radio signals so I got LL SDR priz
software sdl software okay okay I got
the software I got the software all
right what else what else tune to the
appropriate frequency so most Rocky
talkies that are IL legal and you don't
need licenses to operate operate on like
460
megaherz uh you're welcome 460 megaherz
to 460 something megaherz it's actually
in my faing owner manual right here
so we got 22
F uh channels here oh wait that's in
French let me get back here all right so
yeah it's all channels channel one is
462.11cfp be the channels okay so it
looks like at least for the fs codes
here uh channels go from like 42.5 to
4628
okay so that's what you tun your sdr2
okay Monitor and analyze the signals
okay I've been able to do that using the
software to decode it try angulate the
signal with multiple SDR
devices what is this disclaimer I mean
that's disclaimer has been on the same
thing of besides what kind of privacy
are you expecting on a walkietalkie okay
you just broadcasting signals to like
within 30 miles or 25 miles those stupid
Cobra walkie-talkie said that they're
doing that but I mean it was barely
broadcasting to the nearest train
station at my house uh by my house so um
yeah no but I mean I never thought about
getting multiple sdrs to try inate the
signal and then figure out the signal
strength of course you need a map in
like I don't know
40 like
different different sdrs so yeah all
right
J generate uh give us a question you can
ask gab which I'm so glad that it
doesn't make you log in all right let's
see let's see how well it is at
writing stuff like maybe it's not good
at high technical questions here but
let's say
um uh I don't
know I have an
idea okay I was thinking about doing
this with chat gbt but maybe we can no
no no no no no no no oh I was think
about doing this with chat gbt but maybe
we can do this with gab AI because maybe
it's more Christian maybe it's program
on the Bible or something I'm not sure
all right let's go to God
question and we're gonna we're GNA ask
it questions about Christianity and then
um thanks maybe you can keep the audio
on we're gonna ask a question about
Christianity and then we're going to
cross of GQ okay um
all right let's pick a random question
here what does it mean that we are all
in one in Christ Galatians 3:28 okay so
I'm GNA copy that question into chat uh
not chat gab and do okay let me check
the chat oh nothing there okay all right
here we go so our answer from GQ
says oh please
get
Christians to be United in passion plan
and purposes of the Father and Son are
united in the same CH are all treasure
buring Earth
vessels uh every person comes to Jesus
Christ the same way by grace through
faith and repentance from
sin um we are all in one body of Christ
first to call for Unity and Harmony
among brothers and sisters in the body
of Christ um so supposed to walk in a
man like Jesus we embrace our
differences celebrate them as long Above
All We CL ourselves with love B
ourselves in Perfect Harmony and then it
is a spirit un not based on
denominations or
organizations all right great gab
says okay so gives me the first quote
from the
first
okay
um maybe maybe I'm not I'm not I'm like
it's not as in depth as this I mean CH
can go really in depth gab is looks like
it's going into like 500 400 Cal uh not
calories uh
characters okay our next question is
what is the common English
Bible it is a new Bible translation from
2008 to
2011
which is in common
English and it gives me sample byes okay
great let's test
it
oh okay so it's true I mean it's it's a
fact it's not like
a religious question that multiple
denominations are going to have
different
online okay it's another question I I
don't the
what oh it's a
location that's going
to okay let's see here see if we have
any
new new stuff okay so let's put this in
all right so gab pass that one I guess
and back to chat uh okay so it starts in
the Pentecost it'ss first letter lat
expansion the capan fs okay now here we
are in
gab looks pretty good I mean I wouldn't
recommend this for anyone SE can SP to
it said about to go to GQ because you
know this is basically synthesizing
random stuff from the internet okay
let's see let's let's test out some
other facts about stuff here
non-biblical facts let's see how big is
the s24
ultra I don't know if this is connected
to Internet though yet to be
released okay so it's been trained on
last year's data okay how
big is the
s23
ultra bro
millimeters okay 6.7
it's okay okay okay okay let's see um
how big okay let's see if we can do math
what one
plus
five
okay wait who
is the tech
boy
uh I can confirm that my name is not Jak
who
is so that that could be someone else
uh my name is still not
Jake
um I don't even know where they're
getting that
from okay I don't even know where
they're getting Jake
from okay okay okay how big is
the no no no no no how
about here we go WR an essay about the
s20
ultra okay that's true true true true oh
wait no no no no no
no it did not use go victus did it I
don't think so let me
check I don't even think there was a
round back then in the preo
days nope use 6 according to the Corning
website that
eles
865 think so think so did it come I
think
so I mean it is kind of small but not
small but the the software but I mean
gab isn't as bad as I thought it would
be just kind
of just kind
of
you know
like different I think that's where
we're going to start right there today
God bless Tech talk to you
later</pre>
