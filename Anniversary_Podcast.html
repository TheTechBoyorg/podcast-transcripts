um that little video thing that I showed

going to
um
where's my background music yes we're
gonna play my background music full
volume walk up to this week in the
checkpoint podcast
hello and welcome to the tech boy this
week in Tech podcast anyway
[Music]
so those of you who may know that
Twitter has now become
uh x.com is still going to be an access
from twitter.com dark mode it's gonna
only be in dark mode from now on which
okay
and they also took some poor guys X
article which is kind of sad so let's
handle X was taken by Elon Musk to
become the official Twitter
dinky okay
um speaking of Twitter not to be has uh
MTV uh Twitter article I'm gonna show it
to you
um hopefully you guys can see on the
screen when I show it
the internet is kind of weird let's see
Twitter Twitter
that's the one thing that could be
better just search
um X there we go Elon Musk we branded
Twitter as X this uh
this was last week independently and
then people started saying that tweeting
became seeding that is not true
that someone they must use the HTML code
to pretend it was true but it's not
okay here you go
and that's the new logo basically looks
like an X
and they held he held a contest on the
22nd so that was last week's podcast
episode people submitted x uh logos and
if the x is close to anything it should
be all right there go
let's see what Shuffle cruise
and he chose his favorite and they
became
put on Twitter HQ no there are some
legal problems and he did take someone's
X handle which X at X which is around
since 20
uh I'm glad you can't see this 2017 and
what on Earth are you doing AVG go away
um 2017. now let's see if we have any
comments any comments here no I remember
we're trying to get to 100 people in the
light at the same time if we do that I
might do a giveaway
um
all right
okay I forgot you guys can see that all
right
um so yes Twitter we branded itself to X
and now to the more important Tech I
mean t branded website that's right the
tech boy.org and I'd like to thank you
again for reading this website and for
our third anniversary
um every website and we did pretty well
this week so we had a jive one
sponsorship review
um it's talking about the Spanish
language learning web access website
that teaches you Spanish
I'm using NPR stories
um they have like like their own stories
written by some award when the NPR
people
um this is sponsored but I think you
might get some use out of it if you're
interested eight dollars Samsung
released their new phone I'm Gonna Give
opinions on that and of course you can
shave articles on not to be by
bookmarking denim I actually going to
show you how to do that
um
um so back to here let's talk about
Samsung Samsung
um
I don't know what they're up to so when
you write six is about to come out
that's great that's great but
Samsung come on you are better than this
your z-fold four is basically the same
thing as you see forward fact that the
hinge is just different there's nothing
different just like oh there's a new
chick but like it's a hero you upgrade
um at least the tab S9 does have a micro
SD card so from slot support I was
nervous that I wouldn't have it and then
existed flip five
um I'm sorry to Z4 the hinge is just
different does he flip got a bigger
cover display
no Dexter let's look at these specs I
don't think they added decks which is
kind of upset because the Motorola Razor
added decks so we're not Dex decks but
you know what I mean
uh they added what you call it ready for
yeah so if Motorola can add ready for us
and Samsung said easy paper decks now
these Wireless decks all right let's see
what features we have here on the
Samsung Galaxy at uh z45 flip five I'm
sorry and then we're going to talk about
how I got to call the terrorist or
something like that for having this
podcast you know we're moving up in the
world I'm gonna be meeting Addie Stuckey
soon
um
all right galaxy flip five has a 3.4
inch flex window it can run any app you
want but only if you enable the what's
it called uh good lock module on the
device so that's the screen
um I actually said that it has the the
notch again the Samsung brought back the
notch of the Z to Z fold
the default
the original Z4 let's see if I can find
that image for you
oh here it is
um let me show it to you so see this
match here you have to notch up there
and then that's curved down I don't know
why I didn't do that I guess you don't
have to touch the camera module and then
this is the original Galaxy Z fold you
got the notch up here and then it's down
here with the camera so just an
interesting thing that I noticed with
the phone to see if anyone's in the
comments no one yet okay
um
hopefully you guys can come in and watch
let's see what this thing looks like in
a 360 degree thing if the internet holds
up come on
no
okay
um
no no no no no no okay
all right there you go anyway getting
these colors here that kind of looks
like a washing machine
um all right so yes this is the Galaxy Z
Z flip five you can take selfies with
the front camera you have a bigger
screen you can access all your
applications
um and the z45 is basically the same old
same old it's just
a better hint so if you're looking to
upgrade oh hi Steve it says TK Bay made
a short saying that the flip five uh has
video output through USB C4 so Dex can
potentially come to the flip 5 in the
future upgrade
[Music]
that's great that's great that's great
finally but it does mean they can
use Samsung's not Samsung's uh Androids
built in uh
just texting me at this time tonight oh
sleep mode that's what I'm gonna say
um Samsung's uh not Samsung the you know
the default mode oh well there's Wi-Fi
here
um the default mode of
think
the default Android desktop mode that's
what to say okay um let's see what Mr
who's the Boss
you guys want to see Mr who's the boss
oh and of course if you want to donate
to that anniversary fund we always have
things on Ebay listing and we also have
a buy me a coffee buy me a coffee.com
techboard.org so Mr Boss probably
released the video oh yeah about the Z5
um let's look into it
hey I met that guy
we wore the same coat to a party and I
was like twins and then I told him about
this 24 7 waffle place the ashes is
great he's going coach 24 7. here we go
this is the just announced Samsung
Galaxy Z flip 5. does he flip oh
interesting note here um Aaron he's from
uh
England he called it the Z flip five
even though he called the ZTE phones he
calls them the ZTE so interesting note
there and when you first look at it it
doesn't make any sense compared to
Samsung's very highest amphotens which
can be had uh do you find it interesting
that the Z flip 5 has a 6.7 inch screen
that means it's
technically bigger than the uh s22 Plus
like the same price now every camera is
smaller and less capable you can expect
your battery to take longer to charge
and deplete about 20 faster there's less
room for calling so the chip won't
perform as well and yeah this is more
compact it folds right well not really I
mean it is shorter but it is also
thicker so the actual volume being taken
up is about the same and yet even with
all of this
why am I drawn to the Z flip 5 oh wow
that's nice that's real nice that's
actually a they're using this for a
taskbar you got the messages we have the
settings that's interesting so it looks
like they have a really nice custom
version here you got the widget it looks
really really good here what do you
think about that home screen design uh
Steve
so much why is it that my curiosity was
so sparked when I saw that first one oh
that I very nearly switched over to it
when I tested the Z flip 4 last year and
that now we have the five I've decided
that I'm actually going to try and use
this thing on a day-to-day basis how
long do you think he'll make it because
like the gaming performance probably
isn't going that good um what is that
used to like he has a hard time with
balloons on the iPhone 13 the heatings
the hearings not gonna be that good the
cameras there's no telephoto
um but it might help it might help him
digital detox and I guess this is a
competition for the premium digital
detox Market got the nothing phone there
with the lights on the back and then we
have the folding phone here
well with what's new the storage
crystals
um
I'm well thank you and he says
yeah it is
um which screen do you like better the Z
flip screen or the um
Razer screen the Razer screen goes
throughout like the camera is on it so
it's kind of like the camera is a hole
punch camera because the screen goes to
it and the Z flip has that little map
sticky
and welcome to my Channel today is the
anniversary live stream for those of you
who just came in although the price has
also gone up too so one thousand
is it 99 no I think there's still 999
USD that's not really a perk the build
though is a win it's thinner for
starters about two millimeters thinner
when folded up but the best part of this
is how they've achieved it's a new hinge
one that for the very first time on his
Samsung flip can praise the Lord close
without a gap well there is a tiny
little hole here but it's basically
gapless and this is a big deal because
it's not just that it's mostly made
these phones two separate parts like
mini tablets and then just like kind of
magnetically attached to them wouldn't
that be interesting
it looks better and it's a less weird
shape and it takes up less space but it
also creates less room for rogue
particles and pocket dust to just find
their way inside hopefully these are
more doable which trust me use any
folding phone for a period of time is a
problem and it's probably also one of
the main causes of you just ending up
with a scuffed inner screen no matter
how careful you think you're being
speaking of which this inner screen is
now 25. look at that uh
more resistant to scratches and the
outer body is protected by armor
aluminum and Gorilla Glass victus too
nice I'm told Has the strength of
ceramic which is pretty cool considering
that ceramic has long been reserved for
the highest end luxury photo the
aliastin plus uh 5G Edition
because of its scratches that was my
first cell phone presentation I ever did
in school the uh s 2019
early 2019 so I was coming out of
seventh grade uh Steve says Z flip
there's no function for the better for
us enough scripted the chemistry yeah
also you can't really do much with I
mean you can add every active mode on
the kitchen yeah you can um Samsung they
just have to own widgets but they do let
you do use a good lock module to access
anything I don't like and this has kind
of been an ongoing pet peeve of mine is
that when you open the phone it doesn't
snap into that fully open position it's
addicted then the pixel 4 will do that
too like you kind of have to squeeze it
up to 180 degrees and it felt like
you're breaking it it's still just like
a tiny bit flaccid which also means a
tiny bit bent they really should make it
so that opening it feels just as tack
tile and satisfying as closing it
because that is fun but then the screen
is I would say not just a big jump but
the biggest jumps is the very first flip
specifically this look at that tiny
little it's like a fingertip it's cover
screen I mean just compared to Samsung's
last phone it is 270 eight percent
bigger it now looks like a folder and it
can do a lot more used to be able to
have a peek at your notifications check
your calendar and make a quick voice
recording but we're talking like 10 20
of the overall functionality of the
phone now
I'd call it 50. there's 13 different
widgets available at launch and they say
there's more on their way and
essentially each one is its own home
screen you swipe between them and if you
want to move quickly you pinch out and
you pick the one you want plus how would
you be interested in seeing that for a
actual like home screen layout
um for like a full-size Android phone
like if they use that I guess custom mod
and put it onto a phone that actually be
a nice interesting thing for a
smartwatch which we can talk about um if
you want do you want to talk about the
smart watches soon these flip six plus
you can swipe to the left to check your
notifications and down to fiddle with
quick settings it's all very smooth and
slick so you can screen record your
that's interesting what is effectively a
secondary custom operating system on the
same phone and the other thing that I'm
noticing about the way this whole thing
is Being Framed is that it's all about
the personality Samsung's not really
yeah it's like I said
um when my hotsee articles start making
pocket meals doesn't matter packages it
is a fashion phone
like for 999 dollars you can either get
an s23 plus that has better cameras it's
more durable
um
yeah basically that what better cameras
and more durable for the same price and
probably better battery life or you can
get oh wow it's a phone that folds and
you can take your little Instagram
selfies and wheels it's a creative phone
but it doesn't have like I don't know
like do you guys record Instagram wheels
and tick tocks and stuff like that so I
guess you have one one of those people
and take lots of selfies and want to in
fact Samsung's doesn't have the iPhone
basically it's supposed to be like a
cool phone that's supposed to attract
attention or something like that without
you know having that bitten apple really
trying to pitch this front screen as a
way to quickly check things it's more as
a tool for self-expression and that it
achieves I actually cannot build well I
like that customization believe how much
you can customize it everything from the
battery percentage indicator to how to
display notifications to the exact shade
of color that you want and in what way
it fades to another color you could
absolutely lose yourself in it and I
plan to do exactly that a side note you
can also see how much Samsung is pushing
this whole fashion angle here but the
sheer number of cases being offered
including these rather oh let's see what
Steve says uh any solid slab would be
better future more durable under the
same Facebook true all right so I'm
saying it's it's like a fashion phone
um
do you think Samsung will ever switch to
foldables only
so like the S I don't know 27 series
Once the text down good enough to be
like okay slap phones are done you get
foldable phones with decent cameras now
and kind of Overexposed
or underexposed you can see Smart Ones
that when applied will sync the
wallpaper on your phone and even your
Galaxy watch to match plus you can
actually use apps on the front not all
apps which Samsung could have allowed
you to do but I guess they want you to
only use the apps that have been
specifically optimized to make the
movement
there's only like 10 at launch the
screen is now big enough though to get a
full qwerty keyboard on which means you
can also message it's a little fiddly
but completely usable I wonder if I let
you switch to third quality keyboards
like gboard or SwiftKey one hand which
is a luxury that I almost forgotten was
even possible okay there's a couple of
things that I do don't like who's
darkest are you I'm so sorry Milo's been
replaced by his chunkier London
counterparts there's still a crease on
this main display they say it's improved
but it's still very noticeable and I
just think doesn't exactly scream hey
I'm a market leading fifth generation
product and then while this inner panel
is a 120 hertz display that can ramp it
frustrate all the way down to one Hertz
the cover screen which is my other gripe
is locked at 60. and so what this means
is that even when you're trying to use
it in this super low power always on
State this screen is refreshing like 60
times more than it needs to that doesn't
make sense it's best the Samsung's have
really done that because this is like a
tiny battery it has to be split with due
to physics or something makes the
battery life even worse on affordable
phone like you have to split the
batteries instead of having two so yeah
they need to squeeze out every
instrument they get from that device so
it wastes battery there's an upgraded
chip the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 4 Galaxy
which is basically the same Snapdragon
chip you see in all top end Android
phones this year but with a little boost
to how fast it runs I'm actually quite
excited about this not because the phone
necessarily needs it more because these
flip phones feel so perfect for game
emulation which I plan to do a lot of
and is super demanding and then this
chip also has
yeah it seems like gaming is always the
thing that people talk about going with
the chips but apart from video editing
like I I just really want more
applications I can utilize and wanted to
pair with your chips let's see what
Steve says I don't think some people
call it the doability of solid cell
phones are still perfect durability it's
just behind by Design oh okay
so it looks like uh maybe you'll still
have S phones maybe up until the s30
that's seven years from now
it's a slightly tweaked image signal
processor which allows the phone to take
the data from the camera and process it
in a way that Samsung likes and that is
the final key upgrade the cameras not so
much in terms of Hardware I mean there's
a new lens that's a little bit clearer
and reduces sunflowers but it's more the
software you can double tap the power
button to bring it up immediately you've
got new portrait modes and better
quality portrait modes you can mess
around with zoom when you're on the
cover couldn't do that before plus
you've just got more space to see
yourself and frame your shot properly so
while the z-flip 5 might not feel as
ambitious as Motorola's Razer 40 Ultra
and its edge to edge cover screen or the
crease free folding design of oppo's N2
flip at the same time you can't say
Samsung's resting on their Laurels doing
nothing this is a big upgrade and this
company is still widely regarded as
having the best foldable software with
this launching on Android 13l the very
latest with a promise of four full years
of major Android upgrades and the most
seamless integration of foldable
features into third-party apps like just
for example this thing has a camera so
that tracks your face to always keep you
in the middle which is already cool for
making like an Instagram reel but then
the feature can factor in when you fold
the phone adapt around it so that you
can still see yourself in the top half
and then even work natively within these
other apps like Instagram so that's
interesting native app is something that
Samsung's always been behind on that's
like one of the reasons
bad let's see LR buttons would be
awkward on a Game Boy
emulators
this LR stands for left right
so you can even go live using it so you
wait how hard would Game Boy emulation
be like it's a console that came out in
1989 which is it really that powerful
have a level of continuity here that
others are still catching up with oh
yeah and the flex mode is updated so
when you fold up an app that supports it
everything adapts so that you can
control your entire honestly I would
like that mode on a
a phone using just the lower half all of
this stuff is cool it makes the most of
what the phone is but none of it really
explains why the phone even exists in
the first place why is it that people
keep paying this premium to compromise
on specs for a phone that takes up
basically the same volume according to
Samsung
yeah
um maybe they get them on Carrier deals
I'm pretty sure they they can get theirs
on Carrier deals too and seventy percent
of the customers buying foldable phones
are choosing this flip style over the
technically higher end fold style are
they crazy well
no what would you guys rather do s23
plus RZ
um flip five
let's see how I open in the chat
but what is crazy is that we overtook
Samsung and subscribers a long time ago
and we're now this close to overtaking
Apples oh yeah it's so close like uh
2000
if I had a thousand seven hundred
thousand one million seven thousand
subscribers 7000 subscribers had to have
one million seven hundred thousand
subscribers so let's sub to the channel
would be
it's ambitious
quite proud of though look at that text
it's on
because I get the amazing iPhone 14 on
I would say there's five key things that
make this flip as surprisingly appealing
as it is the first and the most obvious
is the style I think I lied to you this
is fun hello almost closer to I remember
you did you get your um phone that I
recommended to you
uh yes and not because I have demanding
game boys I'll have to emulate
um
we're first to disorder buttons on
controllers but can't be on oh I guess
they can't be on screen is what he's
saying
um not yet oh okay
King it open for something important
snapping it shut to end a call there's a
big part of it that feels almost toy
like and it's such a unique prospect
that I guess it's nice even when it's
off you can still have something to do
if you like it there's a good chance
you're gonna love it and if you love it
you're gonna be willing to overlook a
lot of other things to make it work and
thankfully while the cameras are one of
those things that you will have to
forgive because there's no way you can
fit a modern large camera sensor into
the depth of one of these halves they do
also benefit from the ability to fold in
that you can use the same set of pretty
good cameras for both the rear and the
front so if we say that the Galaxy s23
Ultra has a 10 out of 10 camera system
on the rear then its selfie camera is
about a five
oh yeah but I mean this that could be
easily fixed by having adding like a
mirror to the back of the phone honestly
or having like a screen like the me 11.
with the Z flip you're getting a seven
on both with full
what matters more to you selfie or uh
uh back okay so
are you guys using the front camera more
like the front camera to me is it is is
more than enough for me I just use it to
record shorts
um which I need to get back to doing and
I'm probably going to collect some of
this
um podcast what matters more to use
there's a [ __ ] camera like I would
rather have a 10 out of 10 and a 5 out
of 10 than a 7 out of seven or seven set
seven out of seven which mathematically
speaking awesome also Destiny two three
alternative aspect which I really wanted
a phone 4K 60 frames per second video
plus the ability to use 4K 60. I'm
pretty sure I can get 4k 60 on here let
me check
I mean I know it wouldn't be as good
like like you actually got a proper wide
angle camera here
um let me see
um video
yeah you got UHD 60s 4K 60. and you also
got more settings
use the bass as a sort of baked in stand
to prop the phone up at whatever Steve
is finishing his car
yes and yes and not because of how
demanding game boys emulate Game Boy
emulations
or game controllers which can't beat you
on the back of them so that would make
the positions okay
angle you want but it's the mindfulness
that this phone can give you that is
what really interests me the fact that
you can just keep the phone folded up
and you know that you're reachable but
still distance from your distractions is
for me a game changer
yeah
I don't know if that's
okay that's that's basically what a
smartwatch is for it right
reachable we're not distracted
and so I really like that here even
though the cover screen is now more
capable and can do a lot of technically
full screen phone things Samsung's done
this with an understanding that the
objective is not just to make the front
screen like the inner screen because I
mean if they're the same thing then what
would be the point in unfolding it so
instead what you can do here is decide
on the inside which apps you want to
allow yourself access to on the outside
this is brilliant
I mean yeah but you can also hide apps
on your phone
um
so
okay so the way I'm gonna set mine up
for example is to allow maps and
WhatsApp and anything I might need but
keep away oh speaking of WhatsApp
official WhatsApp app is coming to the
Galaxy watch that's that's interesting
um do you guys use WhatsApp uh what's
popular
um for you guys anything I might want
see now a lot of people like to have two
separate phones oh let's see what uh
Steve says to say about affordable oh uh
episode before photos in display selfie
cameras all that entirely really what do
you want pop-ups let's see um no point
in having them if the back cameras and
I'll just face it feels about the same
time interesting take uh what about for
Zoom calls like if you wanna
zoom zoom call around the foot screen uh
what was my original question
Owens one for work one for pleasure
um
you say nope that's nope to what sorry
this one flip phone is kind of like
having both of those but folded into one
it creates this really distinct
separation between a device that is
simple and functional and not
distracting when folded up to advice
that in that case the committee's dick
but
when you finish your work and you just
want to chill out it's expansive and
enjoyable
I wonder how good the gaming performance
is like yes it has a good ship it has
eight gigs of RAM but the screen must
feel plasticky which probably can slow
you down apparently I'm not sure
um I'm pretty sure that sliding on
glasses easily sliding on plastic and of
course you probably can't get to those
high graphic settings
I I don't know I'm not a gamer what do
you guys think
well and indulgent it makes you feel
like a window into your social medias
and your connected life without being a
door that you can just stroll through
and get lost in before you've realized
what you're doing plus I actually like
the fact that when someone calls while
you're in this folded position it'll
automatically go to loudspeaker which
really suits this whole hands-off vibe
and that if you want to silence it you
don't even need to pick the phone up if
you just place your hand on top kind of
like suffocating it the battery also
benefits from this being a flip phone I
mean it sounds bad on the face of it
this is a 3700 million power cell in a
market full of phones packing five
thousand but thanks to efficiency
improvements you can get an extra hour
versus last year's flip four and if you
are actually planning to use a good mix
of both the inner screen and the outer
screen then because the outer screen is
so small you'll save a lot of battery
there and finally there is the
compactness which I wonder if you could
use the outer screen just all day never
unfold it at all as I've already said I
think is a little overrated I mean the
volume difference between this and say
this is negligible but there is one
distinct benefit to being short and
stubby like this women's clothing it's
anyone I met my fiance a few years ago
that it dawned on me just how little
depth there is in women's jeans and
women's workout leggings so it fixes
that let me know if you have any burning
questions about well
I guess three out of five for those
benefits apply to me
um so yeah all right we're gonna go to
some
um technology articles soon let's go to
the Z let's talk about the uh Samsung
Galaxy
uh S6 uh watch
um and don't forget to buy me a coffee
if you want to support the channel
um remember it is my anniversary Street
no question and of course
um if you want to follow me at the tech
boy org
um which brings me to I was actually
called too someone
um tweeting um not just like Pro Terrace
so yeah
um we I guess we're moving up in the
world because we we got my first uh
trolls Let's uh let's see what kind of
comments we have here coming in from ntp
boom tracking here and we're always
talking about that
oh okay
yeah let's talk about this uh thing that
happened I I'll put it down I guess you
can put down the description or comments
um
let me see so we're going to talk about
the Galaxy watch six a more important
Galaxy watch 6 Pro oh we got some new
comments here
um for video calls unfoldables here look
like a little slap posters better video
quality I guess video calls would be
good on flip phones though yeah yeah
um I was talking about if you want to
use the full screen
like the six seven point six hit the
screen all right let's see what we have
here I'm probably going to stream for
like an hour more
um hopefully you guys can see this can
you see the screen to make me go back
and check yes you can okay so this is
the Galaxy uh watch sex position 40 uh
millimeters so I'm pretty sure the
prices for the watch five have dropped
um considerably
let's see what the new features are
we're gonna compare this to the
uh okay so the words for four five so
the watch5 pro is actually bigger than
the OneDrive classic about two
millimeters oh no sorry excellent It's
actually yeah it's bigger than to watch
my phone but then two for two two
millimeters but there's a classic here
so this is basically replacing the 12.
it brought back the rotating bezel so
you know Samsung bring back the rotating
bezel maybe you can bring back the micro
SD card slot just saying
um
all right no okay
but all sapphire crystal displays
basically the same size screen
um fast charging it has an infrared
temperature sensors that's interesting
um I think there's a new application for
it or something like that um let's keep
viewing some more so let's keep seeing
if um what kind of upgrades you got here
a bigger battery
wait
no the classic actually has a smaller
battery than the phone that's weird
um so I guess you have the classic keep
it unless you want that rotating bezel
oh let's see
same levels of durability so yeah it
just looks like an alternative upgrade
maybe some new health features probably
better for people upgrading from before
or maybe from uh tizen Watch the watch
three so yeah there's that uh let's see
what it says about the watch classic but
it does look really nice those materials
looks titanium the screens are also good
all right
um Samsung did release the Z4 drive but
like
it's boring it's just like the z45
it does nothing
um like nothing special it does the same
thing as a c44 except for a different
hinge
well let's find a tech video we're going
to react to let's see
try to find it
two
well as we're trying to look for a tech
video I guess we can do a technology
article about Kroger dropping its
the dropping something
um the dropping
self check not self-checkout they're
bringing soft check out there's a store
in Kroger that only has a self-checkout
from not to be
um we'll get into what uh the
bookmarking again so I'm going to share
a screen NTB technology here we go
all right here we go Tennessee Kroger
transitions to self checkout only only
with no with no cashiers or Baggers but
no one's been fired or anything just
scream a place to
to uh this place to a different part of
the quote and speaking of this is how
you
bookmark your article and you'll find
your bookmarks record I can hear and
scrolling down until you see saved
article safe books would be safe social
posts
Twitter bird
interesting all right and that's what
shorter logo also looks like and see in
the comments no okay so we can talk more
about flip phones here but I think this
is an interesting article
um set self checkout
um no groceries no Baggers self
checkouts only what do you think about
that do you guys use the self checkouts
at your grocery store
let's see do you use
self checkout I worked in an actual poll
but that would mean I have to go to
YouTube but
so do you guys use self-checkout
battle has a Cinematic Universe
that's
well
to each his own I guess
um
oh yeah here's another story from Amazon
um
so this woman got a 100 packages of like
some cheap Chinese junk glue guns
um stuff like that that she didn't order
in Amazon didn't send her
um
and the reasons he got these is these
Amazon packages that a vendor sent to
her because they were trying to clear
out their fulfillment centers which is
stupid and like a strongest drug away so
they sent it to her and Amazon is taking
action against the vendor this is some
random uh Chinese company sending stuff
to a random American customer
um and this is not the first time this
happened so I'm DC when we got
children's betting and the California
one who got 100 portable heaters which
I guess they could send that to
Minnesota but that would be good for
them and I guess the betting like they
could do so much good with this stuff
like you got batting and Hebrews boom
homeless shelter right there and Amazon
bandage sellers for abusive I don't know
behavior and as for Smith sees um
handing over the ant lamps and glue guns
to people just giving them out which I
like
what are you gonna do with the glue gun
like just driving hi I'm Betty uh Smith
and I'm having a glue gun
if you could have any
I guess cheap Chinese good come to your
come to your
home like this what would it be and
Steve says not all the time only when I
have a small amount of stuff and I'm
gonna have two more bags with this stuff
yeah at some stores like HEB which is a
grocery store here in Texas so they only
like to do self checkout if you have 10
or less items
all right this uh where do you go to uh
Tech article so I'm going to stop
sharing and keep
keep looking
all right
hope you can see me
and here oh there we go that's good
lighting too bad I don't have my remote
control lights
oh yeah my mom saw this video before
let's see
all right
let's talk about this gadget it's a
gadgets there that you
um do stuff with the mouse trick your
employer that you're working for thirty
dollars
um so yeah here we go
uh did I just glitch oh thank God all
right I'm back I'm back all right and
after this we'll get back to the Z flip
um five
um
Mr mobile has has good videos on
foldables David this is the new name and
channel the most affordable
um yeah so this just to sketch it
Jiggles your mouse and it just looks
like that so what do you think it looks
stupid would you use this to make people
it looks like it's productive basically
get productive uh
uh and it it tricks the importance of
thinking you're online
so
yeah it's kind of weird so let's see
what Mr mobile has to say about the
phone I actually haven't seen this video
so
it's going to be a live reaction
everything inflating these days you may
wonder why mint is deflating the price
of Mint
sponsored by surf shark
for nearly a year I've dual wielded
Samsung's Galaxy fold 4 and oh I saw a
piece of this daily driver one-two punch
for workday productivity and weekend
portable Play Time same as the fold 3
and Flip 3 before that and the second
and first Generations before as you well
know I am an OG foldy boy
but this year for the first time in
American foldable history Samsung faces
competition in both categories on the
clamshell front Motorola's Razer plus is
a real affront thanks to its larger
front at the same time the Galaxy folds
large format dominance is threatened by
the Google pixel fold and the upcoming
OnePlus foldable
what do you think OnePlus will printed
its uh before we all sample like oh
speaking of uh yeah we got to talk about
the new Avengers Infinity album so yeah
if you get to this we'll talk about that
um I think they're going to just fill
out lots of specs in it but not really
utilize the specs so like no decks or
anything like that well Samsung invited
me to an early Hands-On at its pop-up
experience Center in Herald Square to
see the heat it's bringing to compete
the meaningfully different galaxy flip 5
and the exceedingly familiar Galaxy fold
first let's cover what these have in
common
thanks to a revised hinge both fold and
flip now fold flat when closed each
still enjoys ipx8 water resistance no
the rumored dust proofing is not in
evidence
and each now oh the fold did come with
the new Improvement but it's with the
cases the case is better it has more
colorful aspects but that can be I guess
retroactively added Flex is its folding
screen a little differently
in place of the old u-type narrow radius
Bend there's apparently now a wider
radius water drop fold more like what
every other foldable manufacturer uses
I say apparently because try as I might
I could not find a meaningful
diminishment of the crease when compared
with the 4th gen models now that the
crease is a show stopper but compare
these Samsungs with the first impression
I got off of some of the Oppo Vivo or
Motorola foldables I've reviewed and
well Samsung just doesn't seem to
consider this an area of in which it
must impress
now the company did say those fatter
folds simplified hinges and a new shock
absorbing layer beneath the displays
should help solve the problem of
displays cracking over time that's good
that's good because you want these to
last for at least four years
but while I do believe the folks who
told me that are being genuine Samsung
has a credibility problem when it comes
to durability which I'll get to at the
end
anyway each phone is running on a
Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy and
qualcomm's image signal processor
contained within should help out with
photo and video quality
which is good because Samsung tells me
the camera Hardware again on both is
almost totally identical year over year
save for some spec tweaks to the selfie
cameras and possibly a new
anti-reflective coating on the lenses
sigh
everything else is as expected Gorilla
Glass victus 2 for the bodies armor
aluminum for the frames and what does
Samsung consider a priority they didn't
update the cameras they didn't fix the
the crease
I guess the outer display where they're
gonna add to the z-fold six flip six
that's here sighted design available in
three official colors for the fold and
four for the flip not counting bespoke
options and samsung.com exclusives
and you know what after that rundown we
can kind of call it a wrap for first
impressions of the fold five
the software differences are incredibly
minor just a taskbar with slightly more
room for recent apps and some drag and
drop improvements in multi-window the
thing I'm most looking forward to when
review time comes around is the revised
S Pen
it's much smaller than prior fold Styler
which means the case it lives in can be
much Slimmer now it's not a proper Silo
built into the phone but little by
little we're getting there folks
if you prefer the older girthier pen
you'll be happy to know it's forward
compatible with the full five
most importantly we haven't seen bright
colors on an S Pen since the Galaxy Note
9. loot nine I always wanted when I saw
it in Target
five years ago
and the fold five finally use this exact
color scheme the the yellow
them back proving that Samsung isn't
totally allergic to fun after all
speaking of fun let's flip the page to
the Galaxy flip 5. like the fold the
flip keeps things pretty predictable
inside but the idea this year is you
shouldn't need to open it nearly as
often thanks to a 3.4 inch cover screen
Samsung's calling the flex win wait 3.4
inches you see Amazon iPhone was like
3.5 inches that's wow no
and let's kill two elephants with one
room yes Motorola beat him to the punch
here the Razer Plus cover screen is more
symmetrical and out of the box it can do
more letting you run any of your crazy
heart desires on it
what's his name
Jacqueline 3.6 entrance fans
while Samsung as a whole is Infamous for
packing as many features as it can into
a phone the company has been incredibly
conservative with its external displays
over the years adding only a few
features with each iteration and while
that's been frustrating for a feature
freak like me I have to admit it's also
resulted in very reliable stable cover
screens
with the flip 5 Samsung has extrapolated
that experience to the flex window with
more than a dozen new widgets designed
specifically for this canvas laid out in
a fairly intuitive interface that'll be
familiar to anyone who's used it I like
how they're using that little Notch
thing at the bottom they use it for a
timer just really good software design
from Samsung to watch
and while I've criticized the company in
the past for shipping a Galaxy flip and
then literally never updating its cover
screen with any new features Samsung
says quote many more widgets are to come
unquote
and even if that doesn't pan out it
doesn't really matter because yes you'll
be able to run any app you want to out
here too just like on the Razer Plus
the only difference is that here you'll
have to enable that ability using
Samsung's good luck customization suite
and you might have to wait a short time
after the phone's released for that to
be rolled out yeah
so there are still many reasons you
might choose Motorola release for the
little camera icon it looks that's like
an upside down folder by the way and I
don't care why I kind of right there
reminds me of the Galaxy uh S10 plus all
right Steve says the full office
people who haven't gotten a photo flip
forward we have a base that's two
different five yeah
that to be rolled out
so there are still many reasons you
might choose Motorola but in terms of
raw cover screen capability
yeah it seems like Samsung just leveled
the playing field
now and Samsung gave us an always-on
display option to boot
the only cover screen complaint I can
call out ahead of my flip 5 review is
that even if you choose gboard for your
default keyboard when it comes to the
cover screen you'll use the Samsung one
or you'll use nothing
okay so you cannot change am I excited
for the flip and fold five absolutely
remember thanks to the razer's two-year
absence from America I've spent the past
year living an exclusively Samsung
foldable lifestyle
on a flight to Kansas City back in April
the guy next to me had to use his Meal
box to prop up his slab phone but I was
able to watch Joshua Vergara go Hands-On
with a new phone well let's play Flex
mode on the fold four
later on the same flight I mined the
video archive of the great Anthony
Bourdain rip for BBQ recommendations
well trolling Reddit for the same
I would later go on to use the fold
Force camera to document that same
Southern Mainstay a task for which it
was fairly well suited and I also use
the camera to capture footage of the
whole reason I was there a tour of
Verizon's emergency preparedness
measures for Network reliability
and whether I'm on the road or not I
long ago lost count of all the ways to
make my life easier as a content creator
and as a regular consumer
but you know the turn is coming so let's
just pluck this turkey
I have to say that I was expecting
something a little more ambitious from
Samsung this time around especially when
it comes to the fold
I've been saying for years that I want
that big telephoto camera to come from
the ultra to the fold because on that
same Verizon trip when I needed the
reach to capture the antennas on a
portable cell site only the s23 ultra
could get the job done and that just
feels strange to say that this eighteen
hundred dollar phone in your pocket
can't do all the things at 1200 phone
can do
Samsung's response has usually been
something like well but the battery life
would suffer if we had to make room for
the Periscope camera folks the battery
life on the fold four mine at least is
already atrocious
I mean we might as well get a camera
upgrade if we're gonna live with the
same middling battery capacity and slow
charging as last year both fold and flip
retain the same 40 watt charger figures
there
and including the same exact camera
Hardware as last year after doing nearly
that the year before you know it it just
smacks of the kind of complacency the
competition will hopefully finally start
to disrupt maybe uh
the good thing about this is it means if
I got like a Z flip three off of eBay it
would be like a good price
see either Wi-Fi yeah data he's
downloaded the video
and finally there's the matter of
durability
that's a horse will burn when we come to
it right after this
folks I brutalized microphones I don't
put them in cases and my foldables do
just fine I truly believe the category
as a whole is much more rugged than many
folks would believe but I also believe
that Samsung has been Its Own Worst
Enemy here in two ways first folding
displays on Galaxy phones seem to have a
significant rate of spontaneous failure
in other words the screen just breaks
one day through no fault of the user
that issue continues to be Rife on
Reddit and it also happened to my
colleague Nick sutrick's wife from whom
these photos came I'll leave links in
the description
and second
healing screen protectors
this one I can back up with personal
experience I've had to replace my flip
fours Factory screen protector not once
but twice in less than a year oh and
I've recently noticed my fold for
lifting at the edges too
now it doesn't seem to be dangerous to
the display it's not 2019 you can peel
these off without destroying the display
but the bubbles and discolorations on
lifting protectors are not a good look
to put it mildly
especially since this problem has
existed since at least the third
generation and Samsung specifically said
last year that it wouldn't happen again
here you can listen to my reporting on
it Samsung says it's using a new
adhesive on flip 4 that should prevent
that top layer from lifting at the edges
and it also says the display has a new
layer structure and stronger ultra thin
glass both of which should make it
better able to handle shock damage
this year it's the same p-e-t plastic
over this hopefully it's better this
year same ultra thin glass with I
believe the same adhesive but Samsung
says it's optimistic that the new crease
design combined with yet another
adhesion process will finally prevent
this issue
Samsung also points out the fact that a
one-time protector replacement is still
free and to be fair there are more
service and repair options for Samsung
foldables than any other
yeah here's we have a Samsung oh hi
Shifty eyes shady and z-fold for Success
Shifty we are um celebrating our
anniversary with a podcast live stream
we're talking about the Z flip and then
we're going to talk about
um the new adventures in The Odyssey
album
um oh I got into it like a Twitter war
and got accused of
um being promoting terrorism
um well me too I need to stream like I
said my phone is breaking all well
um oh thank you it's our three year
anniversary
um did you look into the pixel 7A in
seven
to continue being fair I haven't seen
nearly the same screen failure rate at
least on Reddit from my future resume
water drop creases a design Samsung is
finally Now using as well
but we're at the point where the company
needs to actually deliver results yeah
but of course companies in water drop
like does it see fit probably sales more
units so it's going to have a higher
rate of failure let's see Twitter
they'll accuse you of everything that's
true
um
before their Claims can regain my
credulity
oh and I forgot also the little bumpers
came off my flip four but I actually
don't mind this because it means I can
close it even more loudly
Slack
if you're stoked for these fifth
generation foldables the prices are like
many uh I'll see what Shifty has to say
don't forget to depressed I think it's
the same
um Shifty says I haven't looked into the
pixel 7 yet my mom's needing Apple watch
I'm going to look into the pixel 7. all
right great right after this video we're
looking through the pixel 7 to get it
let's just talk about prices same price
same old same up so let's go to the
Google store
and for some reason this is blocked at
my school like the Google Store used to
be
um
so well we'll we'll help shift the eye
Shady
um look look at this right now let's see
what he says and
thumbs up okay here we go
so this is the 7A but I I recommend you
get the set better cameras for a hundred
dollars more but it's it's cheaper than
like any decent iPhone that you get so
it also has a bit bigger screen 6.4
inches instead of 6.1 inch
so here's the pixel 7 for 5.99 in the
pixel 7A for 4.99
um do you have a favorite color yeah the
Cubs and let's see black lemongrass
which is that yellow is kind of it looks
nasty the school's black my local
Community College blocked basic
basic basic one
uh okay here we go
so if you have a favorite color it comes
in lemongrass which is that atrocious
color I would not recommend it uh and
also I don't recommend getting a pixel
case those get awful
um it comes in white it's called snow
and it also comes in Black so basically
black and white and then off from the
other color all right black's your
favorite color so here's what the pixel
7 looks like in Black
6.3 it's fast responsive display I I
think it's 120 hertz I wasn't ready I
think it's 90 Hertz all right a Google
tension G2
which is a decent chip
right it should be more than enough for
you oh I got this book about Samsung
from the library
um
and it also takes good pictures and has
decent features uh shopping websites oh
interesting
um
so um it takes decent pictures but it's
like has
um call spam blocking
um can answer your calls for you
good AI features let me see what has
here so let's compare this phone with
your iPhone XR
oh you can't do that okay
well
it has 24 hour battery life wireless
charging and you can share your battery
with of the people fingerprint unlock
instead of face ID and oh also it's
Facebook and you also get like some free
Google perks like
um Google one
so Shifty what do you think about that
and this is like the pixel ecosystem
and while we do that let's go to the AIO
Wiki
it'll be alive here for 30 minutes 30
more minutes celebrating our anniversary
don't forget
um if you want to buy me a coffee it's
buy me a
coffee.com.org to support the channel
um yeah
all right
thank you
let's see oh no
um throw the link all right thank you
um for the coffee all right yeah it's uh
buy me a coffee.com.org
I'm gonna put it in the chat so you can
see control a control C
there we go

that that song uh but we're gonna be
live for 10 more minutes it's only 11
o'clock where I am uh this kid inspired
me to show my face on YouTube so their
lives I thought he had lives
he's a really good editor at this school
down here oh um he's going to talk about
the pixel
questions
all right and about the past two weeks
or so I've really been diving in and
testing out the Google pixel 7. in that
time I've been so impressed if the eye
Shady here's the review of the Google
pixel 7. hopefully you're watching the
canoe that I officially declare it the
best value phone of 2022. a devices
started strong and kept getting better
with updates a device that already
launched at an amazing price but is now
even cheaper so here's everything you
need to know and why if you're on a bit
of a tighter budget this is the phone
you got so you probably know that in
terms of price phones are roughly
divided into three categories there's
the flagships which are our Company's
top tier devices that have the best of
the best in terms of the screen cameras
battery performance basically everything
nowadays these costs upwards of a
thousand dollars as you just keep
getting more advanced and then there are
budget phones which are devices under
the rough price packet of 300 or so and
these devices work they can do a lot of
what you want but you definitely see how
they cut costs with the cheap build
quality slow performance and garbage
cameras most yeah and they used to have
huge screens like 6.7 6.5 but big bezels
just yeah at the time but in between
these two are mid-tier devices around
the 500 600 price point and these phones
cut Corners in less obvious ways they
may have a slightly worse camera system
maybe a bit less performance not as
advanced software features a slightly
slower display something like that think
of phones like the Galaxy S21 Fe or the
OnePlus 10t and you know you can tell
where costs were caught with these
phones oh yeah who's ready for the s23fe
because these phones are made for a
lower price the reason I'm so excited
about the Google pixel 7 is it blurs the
lines between the mid to your phone and
the flagship phone and it does this all
in a really special way so let's start
with the design this feels like a
flagship and it's almost how a phone
should be it's about the perfect
compromise between having a big enough
screen while easily being usable in one
hand the matte aluminum side rails
website screen to use guys like you guys
like really a nice grip while making the
phone pretty light and the way that
aluminum continues the back camera looks
so epic just don't make the mistake I
did by getting the obsidian black color
it looks depressing and it shows
fingerprints and dust like crazy the
snow or lemongrass colors are far better
options I just got whatever they had in
stock but apart from that the pixel 7
just goes out of its way to feel so fun
and Alive While most less expensive
phones are purely utilitarian not
putting much attention to the animations
of the software or the way the phone
feels when you use it the pixel 7
contrasts that by a mile every little
thing you do on this phone is rewarded
with some sort of quick sharp vibration
as it's elegantly paired with The
Buttery smooth animation that suits the
situation because design extends beyond
the hardware of the phone into the
software as much as I love Samsung's one
UI there's no getting past how bloated
and unnatural it feels Google's pixel
software is just so polished and precise
beautiful what do you guys like in the
chat do you like one UI or a pixel
better and it adds the whole phone just
being this no-brainer go-to the next up
is the screen most cheaper screens suck
but this one doesn't it's crystal clear
with vibrant colors a peak brightness of
1400 nits so it's clearly visible
anywhere and we're not even close to
being done you get a slightly taller
than normal 20x9 aspect ratio so you can
fit more on the screen without having to
scroll as much the crispy 1080p full HD
Plus resolution keeps yourself looking
sharp and the fluid 90hz refresh rate
makes it feel so responsive I can't
think of a better mid to your screen
than this because it just doesn't exist
all right now onto performance starting
last year with the pixel 6 series Google
switch from using Qualcomm Snapdragon
chips which most other companies use to
making their own in-house Google
censorships and Masters censorship
wasn't all that great while it got the
job done it was known for being really
buggy and just didn't perform as well as
other Flagship chips but with the Next
Generation tensor G2 chip and pixel 7 it
seems like those problems have been
fixed the performance in terms of CPU
and GPU is right up there with other top
tier phones and because it's designed by
Google entirely they can completely
optimize the software and other aspects
of the phone around their own chip as
opposed to a one-size-fits-all solution
that you have to settle yeah
um oh just a girl says my favorite film
was Moto G stylist unfortunately I
dropped it well I saw oh
um I think you can get that at Best Buy
or I
um
you know
uh oh Jessica yeah uh what's it called
Walmart
um Jessica you have to hear this I was
called and I quote a terrorist
terrorist for I gotta start to see
um from
uh this podcast I was reported for being
called a terrorist uh for big terrorists
to Jason or something like that me
little on me can you believe it
this is like super long thread
um I'm gonna link it in but that's not
what I was called too it's in a quote
tweet
um what's the person that even say it to
my face and I like it remember tweets on
that called seats
just a little PSA for you guys
88 followers all right that's good
um
oh yes I think it's for play
okay let me show it to you guys
maybe I'll finish this video up uh just
a girl says oh gee yeah I know I'm
basically becoming Ali stuck you know
you know I'm special
uh
ah here we go
I reported all your YouTube videos as
hate speech uh let's talk about my
YouTube videos on this channel hate
speech I I mean I I guess you could
classify my dislike as apple as hate
speech but I'm look through Google's
gonna go with that and uh the videos
were
pro-charism and promoted violence
um are we looking at the same channel
uh my most recent video not live podcast
episode was a video of me running around
Best Buy now I don't know how you get
terrorists back but
okay
um
most videos are podcast episodes
and I just had to cancel the footage I
never said to blow it up okay
um
so
I I don't see how you get terrorism in
violence what what violence it second of
all you said most of the videos it is
yeah I know it is a bad Savannah I'm
like Annie stuckina
but what I don't understand is
how Okay
um
essentially everything you have YouTube
um I guess missing me about that
is anti-christian you give Christians a
bad name
Bible verse I hate speech oh well
um please I I I would love to see
um
if you haven't seen my uh YouTube
channel it's a tech YouTube channel
uh I I don't understand how terrorism
what terrorism has to do with anything
um and back to the video I'm going to
show you the thread that sparked all of
this
on the chip they can get that chip much
cheaper from their manufacturing
Partners compared to qualcommer Media
Tech pull out a bunch of royalties on
top of that making it more expensive for
the manufacturer when you combine this
amazing performance here really smooth
the rest of the system you can see why I
like it so much but an area where less
expensive phones really struggle
goodness the camera system like
definitely not here Google pictures I've
always been known for their excellent
cameras but the pixel 7 takes that even
further most five to six hundred dollar
phones have decent camera systems
they'll give you good camera Hardware
with large sensors and even some cool
software features sometimes but see it's
just that they're often let down by that
software because it's just not as
advanced why would a company who's
making a cheaper phone put all these
resources into building super okay
software
um here it is right here
I'm gonna tell you it's it's kind of
long and if you're watching this just
know that then praying for you
um there you go
so let's finish off this video maybe
I'll show you my YouTube channel you
know just to go um I want you to tell me
if it looks like a terrorist Channel
then he's just going to talk about the
value and software all right so tell me
if this looks like a Taylor's Channel
you know I'm an expert so you know I
might be biased towards myself
but
there's a scroll through some of these
videos let's go do some of your shorts
okay
um here we go popular shorts you know
let's go to the most popular video
um so I talked about uh Apple nerd
goggle spank on you
okay like I would say that it's taoism
and then I talk about hating tick tock
okay then here's an iPhone case this is
a rectangularism to you
