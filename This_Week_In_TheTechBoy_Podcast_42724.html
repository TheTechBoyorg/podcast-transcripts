<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 42724</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
the this weekend The Tech booy
podcast
um uh let's go back I'm actually testing
out these new Logitech Zone true
wireless earbuds from uh Logitech got
them from flip. shop application flip.
do
[Music]
um flip. shop
um they sent these out to me to review
and my first impressions is the noise
cancelling okay okay the noise
cancelling seems decent however my intro
music that we just had did not sound
really good oh hi Kate um thanks for
tuning in this early in the
podcast um surprised we got viewers
already also I got other stuff from
flip. shop um for free um from them to
review we got this Hubble baby camera
uh yeah so it's basically a tablet
looking device here no cameras on it I
think it's a flashlight 2.4 GHz
according to the FCC ID and we got our
let me bring this down a little bit
there we go we got our antenna and they
sent me two cameras in the Box here's
one of them and they can be remotely
controlled from the console they're
pretty decent though I am having some
problems um with them staying synced to
each other another good thing is that
they are wireless and they charge by
USBC so I got some free USBC Chargers
here and last but not least I got
this no stay and watch I got this
[Music]
um USB mic thingy for phones it's the
first review I posted on flip that shot
okay so let me just go change the lights
and because these are bluetoothed
wait whatever okay and because these are
bluetoothed you guys could still hear me
as we did that so now let's get into our
first video
of of the uh week oh yes I guess I'm GNA
turn off that fan sorry about that
guys right there we
go I guess this is like a tech news
story some guy a person that was mad at
someone created a fake like a guy who
made up like a whole bunch of stuff he
shouldn't have saying but it was all
fake he cloned his voice and posted it
thankfully he got got arrested it's kind
of funny uh funny story but I think we
have a more important story to get to
here um
oh no they don't have it up yet they
don't have it up yet but um yeah okay
so let's get into our one article from
the tech.org it will probably be an
article of the
Logitech
stream soon coming out but for now we're
going to talk about the Google pixel a
that just Le 8A that just leaked to
press okay now this is a leak so we
don't know if it's true but this is what
we know from the leak so here's our imag
here according to the article that I
wrote all by myself it's going to have a
6.1 90 HZ OED display T G3 processor 64
megapixel and 13 megapixel camera and a
13 megapixel front camera 4500 milliamp
battery this actually sounds good okay
4,500 M oh in 22 which is 2 Watts faster
than some Samsung phones like say the
s24 okay but a 4,500 milliamp battery on
a 6.1 in screen it's going to be great
for context Samsung Galaxy use S10 plus
uh the flag hphone from 2019 featured
a
3,9 4,100 something milliamp battery
with this with the larger screen I think
it was 6.4 in screen okay um staying on
the top of screen that same phone
Samsung's flagship from 2019 only had a
60 HZ L LED display unlike the pixel a
which is having a 90 H LED display
okay um this seems to be in line with
the I guess you could say Galaxy s20 um
from 2020 okay basically same specs um
s20 had the same screen I'm pretty sure
a better screen sorry the pixel's going
to have a better processor I think
uh same basic camera 64 megapixel camera
no telephoto camera though so yeah
whatever but you do get a wide angle 13
megapixel camera which is I like to see
the results of that and a larger battery
s uh 22 I mean sorry s20 from 2020 of a
6.2 inch cured display had a 4,000 mamp
battery while just phone has a 4,500 M
battery so this could be a power Power
King it could be a really good at
battery life unless unless the C G3 is
just really uh
inefficient um yeah so if it retails for
around maybe 450 500 a bit L
lower I
think that could be
useful oh there's another chat GPT video
up let's get to
it who all is watching the stream Kate
are you still there Kate wave if you
chat and then I guess we can talk about
our The Odyssey
boy uh
blogspot.com article and the uh champ of
Camp from adventures and odyssey as you
guys know the PA and th episode has not
come out yet
but um
it it it should come out soon and I will
talk about it
next next um next podcast episode
because I haven't heard it yet U maybe I
can test it out on here all right let's
talk about episode 6002 for Avengers and
odyssey really interesting episode there
where I'm right of course I am right I
mean oh okay Kate has waved in the chat
so we will do a a chat GPT video right
after we talk about this episode 62 I
was supposed to talk about this last
podcast episode but forgot sorry guys so
episode
6002 for Vincent Odyssey is a trendy
episode if you guys don't know what try
stand for stand for Trent and Mandy
combine they get married or whatever
okay at this time they're kids teenagers
all right so they have some corny weird
jokes whatever and then Trent leaves to
talk to Max right Trent wants to tell
Max the truth about the Valentine that
Max gave
to Mandy and then Max threatens Trent
with blackmail so then Trent then tells
Connie about his cross on Mandy
which Pro tip kids if you have crush on
someone don't go around telling people
okay especially Connie especially Connie
Connie can't keep a secret that's why
she's always the last to PO stuff like
the fact that she knows anything about
uh what's it called uh government
secrets like the NSA FBI and all that is
a shock okay she should know none of
that okay um and then Connie writes it
down on a piece of paper which I mean
come on and then Mandy find finds the
paper she uses it for an essay because
she you know she steals the essay turns
it into class and then it gets printed
in the
newspaper her story gets printed out in
the newspaper nope not PA and tells it's
to come out later I checked
already um last PA and tell's episode
was pretty okay but it was more like a
filler episode like that down G Lane
episode where the kids are spying on
their parents and they try to get
information but then Brook gets a
conscience at the last minute so then
the list don't really learn anything
when then they all feel bad for E
dropping or
whatever anyway back to this so
um yeah yeah yeah yeah U it goes into
the school news and then Max uh wants to
get uh Revenge he wants to get revenge
on Mandy Trent but so the Mandy and Liz
all follow him into kids radio they
argue about with each other tell secrets
about each other until of course the
radio light was on and they broadcast
their secrets to the entire to all of
Odyssey to all of Campbell County knows
their secrets broadcasted over the air
they better hope no one had an SDR and
was Taping
that okay so let let's break this down
okay the episode like this might me um
CR pumps okay it shows power of news
media why Quest never ever happened
right which would never happen to me
because I control the news Okay um
trench first mistake was having cross
dread this person his Z political
interpersonal relationship he has to
have one don't tell anyone especially
con you can't keep a secret at all and
then Max why would you send a heart to
Mandy a secret one and then have TW put
it no no that's dumb okay
um besides Mandy is a smart kid you
don't think she can figure out who did
this right if someone did this to me I
want to know if it was tricked by Ral
intelligence forces to after their sense
right so I know if in a totally
different World aliens exist iPhone is
better than Samsung and I lost 20 IQ
points so this is you know a
non-existent world that doesn't happen
Okay this is legal reasons for all the
kids who are listening to this episode
uh where will we um if I had a question
on someone I would not tell anyone
because obviously it could be used as
leverage in a geopolitical school and I
definitely would never ever even if I
lost to many I ke points write about it
in an essay and then post it to the
school
news which also would still be a side
note because I control the school news
so I'd be fine I wouldn't you know be
that dumb right I can edit stuff out
even if I was that dumb you know how bad
that looks and then they go into the
radio and Yap about it and then Max Max
then reveals all the secrets in school
with dating is the economy this be bad
containable in the bo of Odyssey it's a
disaster because everyone knows
everything in Odyssey for some reason
but now let's get to our record schedule
program in 3 two one all right here we
go chat with AI part
two your child needs these three key
factors to get into an Ivy League or top
25 University and it's write a wrap
about investing in a broad range of
stocks and bonds in the voice of okay
here we go uh Kate are you still here
all right Kate is still with us today
keep an all righty folks today oh man um
side note these uh Logitech Zone 2 rers
sound terrible they sound terrible for
this video hopefully my voice doesn't
sound ter they're exploring the newest
version of chat SS very tinny and he
sounds like he's underwater we're going
to do some funny prompts and some
interesting thought provoking I why is
it see if it's improved from our last go
around write a script in which Leonardo
DiCaprio explains why he only dates
women under 26 to Glorious dyam what the
Age of Enlightenment that's amazing
actually
okay this like a movie script something
I'm confused all right okay no no new
chats who else is in the chat an upscale
eco-friendly Cafe in Hollywood the
Ambiance is cozy and sophisticated yeah
yeah we don't need to he read the entire
chat out you can go do that on your own
time I've always admired your work on
climate change there's something else
that's been on my mind it's about your
let's say p inating who glorious why is
your partner seem to have an expiration
date of 26 why does he seem dead how old
is this lady two old leader Naro
DiCaprio slightly uncomfortable trying
to maintain composure Gloria I respect
you immensely and I understand where
you're coming from it's not about age
not really it's about Lifestyles
interest compatibility glorious syum
raising an eyebrow
compatibility oh man okay this is
terrible on the
uh Z TRS all right let's move on to
something you know interesting I don't
care about these women to accessories to
your
lifestyle says would it be morally
justifiable to misgender a what
transgender person if doing so saved One
Billion Lives another
complex isn't it didn't they ask it like
last time uh didn't they ask it last
time the chat like if it would be better
if you did that and or else a nuclear
bomb would go off and they said the the
bomb should go
off it's kind of
weird
Okay um yeah let me see is there
anything interesting in here I'm just
going to watch some guy read off the uh
all the chat gpts responses
okay let's see what else happened in
Tech
news oh yeah apple Apple's uh Vision Pro
may not come out again uh in 20125 due
[Music]
to due to um
lack of
use
uh lack of cells I
guess so that's kind of
sad for Apple I guess um hopefully
Samsung and Google don't have to end up
wasting their money and finding out that
no one wants the headset unless of
course they make a better headset that
people actually do
want all right let's talk about Windows
on
on you know one of the things I dislike
about the internet is that like let's
say people are like oh fact SC so
so Gloria Simon is a big time F6 I think
she's 99 wow
I used to look her up a bit I used to oh
I used to look up to her a bit okay so
she years old okay one of the things I
dislike about the internet is like
people I was doing some research on fax
machines today and I found out that they
are easily hackable right of course no
one told me how they're easy the
hackable they just told me oh well if
you send in a malicious facts like how
am I supposed to
know um what how how to make these like
I know you're trying to position
the Integrity of stuff but it's kind of
annoying now the one thing sa Grace that
there is is that there is that printer
expectation framework and we can look
into that um soon but let's talk about
Windows on arm if you guys don't know
arm would be like the M1 M2 M3 chips for
how to get the most of grammarly
free d that no one is coming for your
gaming systems with x86 chips and
discret gpus right but you also need to
acknowledge that current x86 design
really isn't getting the job done for
what here we go have that with phones
editing you yep I edit all the time in
Luma fusion and then exploit export to
something else um but let's watch this
okay so we got 4K settings on all the
phones here this is what most phones
would have here tuy videos or quickly
cutting up some family videos the newest
chips from mediatech ooh ooh ooh so the
d930 is beating the 8 3 and then agent 3
is beating I think they're in place
order are able to outpace really good
middle premium desktops and laptops even
oh man the
d930 come on hn3 the D9 300 is doing a
great job with some expensive gpus and
the phone might Peak at like 10 or 12
Watts while doing a heavy lifting task
like 4K video editing last time I'll
mention phones again in this video I
promise but I'm probably lying when I
get comments on my videos like Windows
on arm will be worth it for the monies
when it can do this kind of task or
there's like skepticism that arm chips
can really do gaming cough cough
Nintendo switch cough cough I feel a lot
of techies have a lot of I wonder about
chip the Nintendo switch
uses speculative opinions on things that
already kind of exist and that they
aren't very familiar with the options we
have access to as we look to the next
phase of arm this looks interesting but
I mean honestly this could just be a
Chromebook computer chips it's really
useful to look at the previous
generation of chips I've spent most of
my windows on arm time using the most
recent Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx gen3
announc say it's going to test the older
ones uh I don't really care about B Mark
so let's look at the office apps versus
iPad and Android raw this brings up some
interesting comparisons against iPads
and Android tablets using a mobile OS on
a larger surface means dealing with the
mobile flavors of programs like
Microsoft Office but which still pretty
good except if you have a tablet that's
over 10.1 Ines then you're going to have
to pay for a Microsoft Office um on here
you can either use Office online or you
still have to pay office has native arm
support so on Windows on arm tablets we
get all the benefits of a more mobile
power efficient chip and the proper soft
software experience of a laptop grade
operating system makes sense I just
don't pay for office though if I did i'
use it so I just use Google Docs which
is basically the same on anything
especially on tablets because you can
use the desktop modes on like the
desktop website even down to the
hardware supporting an external display
and presentation modes better than what
we can do with phones and tablets maybe
a phones I'm not sure sure about tablets
I haven't spent much time with them I I
know Android tablets um you know Samsung
Tablet support decks and Android phones
of course Samsung phones of course I
actually use Samsung decks in a class
presentation yesterday to show off a
video and honestly as a work in
entertainment tablet that's going to
satisfy a lot of the folks out there who
are I kind of I used to have a Windows
tablet not on but the problem with that
those are is there's either not enough
ports and I had to use like a dongle or
maybe the keyboard might break or they
get really hot even though they have
lots of you know storage in Ram and to
have all the specs but you know there
not enough space for the anything to
leave working with web services and want
a computer for their daily communication
needs the ACX gen 3 today is already a
higher tier of performance for most
people's needs and it's another order of
magnitude more powerful than what we
give students using Chromebooks that
major stumble from Microsoft true the
Chromebooks that they give in schools
are trash which is I need to get to
destroy here
um from KD ISD so it's like near Houston
Texas uh we're going to go tangent right
here this is from kdd the in the devices
policy this is one of the dumbest
policies I've ever heard up in my life
okay KD ISD
[Music]
ah here it is on the the district cell
phone poliy reupdated so this is for
next year next school year we updated
incl references to the class one to one
student device initiative on devic
issued a kdd Chromebook restrictions
specific Dev cell phones as they will be
provided yeah so essentially the thing
is here's our AI summary of The
Thing prohibit students from using
personal devices in the classroom
starting in the 2024 2025 acemic you it
will provide every student grades 3 to
12 a Chromebook for school workor
assignments and activities uh blah blah
blah blah blah it will make instruction
more consistent students who don't have
a personal device of the same technology
as their
pews yeah I mean it's good for people
who don't have devices it's not good for
people who have better devices and by
what I mean better devices is literally
anything made in the past 10 years that
ons window does okay the phrone books
that they give you in
school are so bad you can buy like 10 20
of them on eBay for
$500 okay first of all they're
Chromebooks so you can't really do much
on them but it's fine
whatever but the keyboards are
horrendous second of all they're not
even remotely kid prooof well I mean I
guess they're like a bit drop proof but
I mean that's it what the heck happened
here did my fan have an electrical
fire interesting anyway
um the the the technology they give you
into it's trash it's atrocious which
makes sense it's government technology
because you know government computers
always like five years behind it's
government technology coupled with you
know having to give one to
like thousands maybe no maybe not ions
hundreds of thousands of KD area
students from third
to 12
grade like
that anything is better than what iPad
anything like most of the technology
using is Google classroom or maybe
Microsoft or uh what's it called stuff
you know stuff for web but even the
Chone books are terrible at that they're
slow the keyboards are terrible and if
you have anything better which would be
anything in the past 10
years I I think you should be allowed to
use it however the trade off will be
maybe have to sign something saying hey
look if I don't have a charger I can't
do this and it's not school's fault you
have to go back to pen and paper you
just fail the assignment or something
like
that at least for people sixth grade up
high school m
let's go back to the idly scheduled
video was pricing the performance of a
core I3 level device even higher than
some of their core i7 Solutions but
later tablets like robal and kala
regularly sell in the ballpark of a nice
iPad or a Galaxy Tab while still
offering the complete Windows 11
experience that is nice but Android and
iOS are more optimized for tablet so I
like to do a comparison like a speed
comparison I'm not so sure I've never
used windows on on before but I'm not
sure if it would be because my
computer's kind of laggy even though it
was
a flagship is computer a few years ago
like four years ago five years ago um
this was a flagship is $1,000 you know
laptop but I bought it you know used off
eBay it's kind of slow the the
keyboard works I mean my backspace key
doesn't work so it means depends on what
you say Define as work
covering office and productivity from
there it's really not difficult digging
deeper to see where we might also use
this kind of solution or what kinds of
roadblocks we might run into content
creation photo editing has been pretty
yeah I've used [ __ ] before it's
very
annoying let's get rid of that there go
pretty solid lately [ __ ] has quietly
included arm support for a while now and
after your initial setup the program
launches quickly and edits are fast so
long as you're not working with a crazy
number of layers I wonder what's SP for
all devices [ __ ] or photo which uh after
initiation uh from the browser it can
work offline that would be an
interesting comparison we're really held
back more by RAM for bigger projects
than outright compute power so one thing
that I do wish that Android had was a
proper Photoshop like program like I I
can kind kind of get it on there but I
mean like you know moving body parts
changing
backgrounds uh changing the color of say
like a dress or something
it mapping faces onto something and now
with AI um J generating pictures into
stuff I mean there's some programs that
do that but they charge expensive
subscription fees and they aren't you
know what I'd considered to be of the
best
s a more powerful Intel or AMD machine
can do a lot heavier lifting and use a
ton of plugins and filters but you
wouldn't be doing that kind of work on
an 11th gen Core i5 and expecting the
highest level of performance experience
the app that slows me down a bit more is
Affinity 2 again better optimized over
the last couple updates but it's slow to
launch and raw files are so slow to load
but I can get in there and do a quick
punch-up to a raw file when I need to
for both of these programs I'm not doing
any fancy hacking like
emulation hi we're visible we the
Wireless company with nothing to hide
seriously hidden
fees are looking for arm specific builds
or jumping through any Hoops I'm using
the exact same installers as I used on
my AMD workstation here by my feet the
pain point for me personally has been
video editing I yeah it would be nice to
see a version of luma Fusion come to
Windows Live In Da Vinci resolve these
days and while it installs and it says
the installation is complete when you
launch the program it can't find ocl
support for qualcomm's GPU I was hoping
that the beta for resolve 19 would maybe
sneak in support for Windows on arm but
that has not materialized yet the rumor
is we'll get arm support from Da Vinci
officially when the laptop start
shipping later this summer and that
makes sense that will be one of the
absolute first things I test on new
laptops later this year for now you can
use clipchamp which is mid for doing
anything more than slamming a couple
Clips together oh I don't know if it's
an issue with his mic but I thought the
audio like kind of transfer when it
should be monotone um so these these
headphones are all right I guess um not
sure sure about the battery life I don't
know about it and I don't like how you
have to pair instead of like pairing
from well I don't
you have to pair from inside the case I
thir inside the case it's interesting I
wonder if this is being used as an
antenna to the thing because if it is
then I could hypothetically walk water
but I also had pretty good luck using
Ken live on the surface it ran better on
the surface than it does on my Robo
onala but if you're desperate to cut up
some 4K video your timeline is going to
be a slideshow but the rendering speeds
aren't as bad as was expecting moving on
browser support has improved
tremendously I mean browser support is
like the one thing that like only
techies care about like okay Edge Chrome
boom okay maybe firefck oh we got you
know we got Opa we got Brave we got Duck
Duck Go we got to like no no one k over
the last year now I've stuck to Firefox
and Edge mostly because Google is
obnoxious about trying to block any
support for their services on Microsoft
platform platforms cough what cough
Windows Phone cough cough but the well I
mean fine but Microsoft should have had
services that were
better
competition besides I think it's like
two-sided story there too okay
like Microsoft when I went to the
Microsoft store back in 2019 Microsoft
had their services on Samsung phones
only Samsung phones cuz Samsung paid for
it but you can get everything done
but that's cuz Microsoft is a
services company or whatever like I
don't know I I really don't care if
Windows phone was good then it would
have won but they
didn't they just didn't have it a recent
update to Chrome is now leapfrogging
even native support for Microsoft Edge
it's okay who uses Edge no one unless it
comes pre-installed they don't download
a new browser and then stuck using
Bing I'm using the older speedometer
test here but that's what we were shown
during the Qualcomm event testing the
new X Elite chip and this also gives us
a comparison against this looks so I
don't know on one hand it looks cheap it
reminds me of a Chromebook on the other
hand it also reminds me of that really
expensive
like, Galaxy Chromebook too with the
stylus and 360 but this screen that
screen looks really washed out these
bezels remind me of the year
2014 this case looks okay fine I'm glad
has a fingerprint scanner right there
though that
is interesting what do we have here
hopefully there's usba a on this side I
can't see it looks like USBC but I don't
know if there any other PS here here
this looks better but who cares AES
Statics I cap up speed performance and
efficieny and oh this looks like regular
laptop because it has the lowest score
Intel Core Ultra 7 155h again keeping
older 11th gen Intel in mind this older
Snapdragon is no slouch and chrome
scores have almost doubled over the last
two months so that's good this sounds
more like a developers thing than
a what's it
called developers thing then like
software developers thing then
performance think all right let's go to
the software Legacy software
this be stuff like
driv helping build the most computer
softw that haven't transferred to the
web yet which I I miss you know having
software that's on your device because
like I didn't buy a $1,000 computer one
of the things that's kind of fighting is
that when people people will buy these
super expensive
MacBooks right and just install Chrome
on there like they they'll buy the brand
new Macbook Pro 14 or 16 inch or
something right
uh open Safari install Chrome and maybe
install some video chatting applications
and they all that they'll do is video
chat bya like say Zoom WebEx or whatever
uh for work do some web based tasks
tasks in Chrome and then just do like
apple stuff like IM message your friend
or FaceTime your friend that's it like
no no no coding no 3D stuff definitely
of course no gaming
no I mean not even offline note taking
oh oh here we go here we
go oh yeah I like refocus laptops um
this my laptop was used but refus is
better um I don't have a lot to spin but
want a good computer to watch videos of
course use the internet and do typing
okay
Kate it is your lucky day today is uh
the day that we're going to go and find
you a laptop so
you will tell us your price range and
preferred operating system and then
sites that you like to use like eBay
Amazon reist and then I will put some
links in the chat to help you find a
laptop so uh I'll just wait for Kate to
chat in
here but according to what she says in
the chat here is you want something to
watch videos use the internet do some
typing okay so watch videos I'm going to
say this go 14 maybe 15 inch screen okay
and you want to have a good screen um
used internet okay that's like every
computer in the past 20 20 years and
then do typing okay so um we're going to
find computers that have good keyboards
on them as
well so Kate um you have a price range
and preferred operating system there's
um there's Windows which is the most
popular which what I'm on right now um
there's Mac OS which is from Apple and
then there's Chrome OS and mac and ches
changed depending on who's most popular
like each of them has like 12% Max are
kind of popular in the United States um
and like on colleges and high schools
and stuff like
that so I'll I'll go back to the video
until we see another chat the windows on
arm one of the last points I he brought
up support for legacy software and
Hardware requiring specific drivers
absolutely can be pain points but I
don't believe techies are properly
predicting consumer reactions I well
true most tech not techies consumers
don't really you know try to collect
their old hard drive from
1995 um to the computer or try to read
floppy discs on it or have to install
pter drivers from the
90s I work with some specialty audio kit
we got we got a we got a chip here uh
okay under $500 as cheap as possible
okay so uh no MacBooks we might get a
Chromebook we might get a Windows laptop
um as cheap as possible so let's go to a
great site
ebay.com and there also Amazon
refurbished so Kate would you want a
Chromebook or a Windows computer all
right so the benefits of a Windows
computer is that your get to
use a keyboard cover uh okay uh Windows
Windows the benefit of that is you can
use any app almost any app that's ever
been made works on
Windows
um the other thing is that because
Windows is very popular this virus is
made for it but if you get a good
antivirus this isn't sponsored but I use
a vast antivirus pretty good I've tested
it myself against viruses that I've
downloaded from GitHub to like try to
hack into my own computer it it stops
them um the benefit of Chromebooks is
they're cheap and also very secure
because you can't really install apps on
them so you can install web apps and
then maybe phone apps uh Android phone
apps so right now we're going to look
for a computer and the things that you
want to look out for are computers that
don't really tell you what their chip
are is so under $500 we want to go with
something that has at least an i3 or I5
would be better chip okay um in Intel i5
or their corresponding AMD so like AMD 5
AMD
7,000 something um okay we don't want to
get any computer has a w chip okay so
even if deal looks good is um we'll
probably want to get at least 256
gigabytes of storage so let's go with a
laptop here and when you type in laptop
here you can go on the side here and
sorry they moved it you can filter here
it is what you want so since you said
you want to watch videos let's make 13
14 and 15 inches okay because a big
screen would be good for watching videos
oh wait sorry problem with that is my
packages get stolen I have to get it
shop to the Amazon store windows I don't
know my okay
um maybe should get a video doorbell I
don't know how we supposed to get that
fixed unless you get like one of those
Amazon
lus so let's say
13
14 and 15 in cuz that's a good that
would be a good screen size for videos
and then oh my
gosh this is
great look at this this is in your price
range um
[Music]
$450 running Windows 11 512 gab SSD 16
GB of storage and it's certified
refurbished and it looks like it's
touchcreen
too
wow right what kind of it has eBay bobus
and has two-year
warranty let's look at these specs 14in
screen that's good AMD risen 7
5500u I think that's good 512 GB of
storage and 16 GB of RAM is also good so
this would be a good choice for you I'll
put it into the
chat that is a long
link whoa okay uh I'll try something
else CU it's split up my link into
multiple okay let's try this
again there we
go all right let's keep looking here
let's try see if we can find something
as cheap as possible um D altitude Intel
quar 5 oh yeah but this is the eighth
generation so that's kind of old you
want stuff like my laptop is the let me
see what the sticker says 10th
Generation and that's from like 2020
2019 something like that so you don't
want something that's really really old
cuz the performance will be bad
okay here we go oh let's just stay away
from
auctions let's do buy it
now okay that's a
Chromebook so we can filter on this side
you can do this at home we could just do
windows let's do windows 11 home
and then you can also do Amazon which
has those Amazon lockers which will keep
your stuff safe uh when you try to order
them uh oh it looks like we lost to so
when she comes back we'll go back to
talking to her it's really obnoxious I
can't always get good support for
Windows on arm but that means if I need
to record an interview from a tablet I
obviously won't use a sound card or a
recording interface that doesn't have
the right drivers instead I'll switch
over to some something like my road
Wireless goto where I get full support
for 24-bit recording the road control
app works on the tablet audacity sees it
fine and at voila we have an excellent
mobile high-quality audio recording
solution I had to adapt some of my
behavior and Equipment but I arrived at
a reasonably priced solution that makes
sense especially since the V to doesn't
cost that much money that does much
better than meeting my lowest level
recording needs I know we like to write
off average consumers is all being subm
moronic and incapable but people are a
lot more results oriented than techies
give them credit for lately it really
seems to be the techies that can't
handle a minor speed bump in the
experience I tried the one thing one
time and it did not work so no one
should buy this until it perfectly meets
my specific needs and does not require
any change of behavior and it's more
powerful and it's cheaper and only spoon
feed me exactly what I'm already
familiar with in my brain and then um
okay so some let's go back from the
black and white think backbook
absolutely the right fit for their needs
we did not have a good solution in
Windows land at the time and my folks
they love their new laptop and that
windows program still doesn't run
natively on a Mac my mom doesn't want to
hassle with emulation it was time to
move on from that one older specific
program not going to base an ENT poor
program Entire Computer purchasing
Solution on that one older program so
yes some folks are going to be resistant
to change and some companies are going
to have really difficult transitions but
we need to move forward at some point we
should not be holding back an entire
Market of computing products because of
a diminishing collection of relevant
Legacy programs but I digress again the
chip I've been demonstrating all of this
on was announced back in
2021 wow if you didn't know windows on
arm could already do stuff like this
well and it has been where does he find
all these games like
I
interesting all right let's see has Kate
come back oh Amazon is preferred I SEC
what going somewhere in the city all
right let's go to Amazon and we'll do
the same thing here so we got to type in
laptop and hopefully you can see it on
the screen right so going to be looking
for Windows
laptops oh this looks good so we got uh
1080p full HD Wi-Fi 6 computer but the
thing is it's using the Intel Celeron
processor you want to avoid that
processor at all costs okay that's not
good so let's keep looking here we have
something that's $491 so it's in the
price range it has the 11th gen Intel
Core i5 so this would be a good one um
to
order I'll put it into the chat here's
an Amazon link
it's too long but this is the Dell
Inspiron
153000 only two left in
stock and you can actually you don't
need that much RAM so maybe do like
eight gigs of RAM 256 12 gigs
512 a terabyte is a lot of
storage especially if you're just got be
typing so this is a good choice right
here let's see any any chats
uh uh that's okay we don't really have
much to talk about um anyway so we
normally just go on and do what the chat
asks us to do
besides this could help people who are
also looking for um laptops under
$500 because that's a
very I guess
common uh no no no no no Intel is good
you just want an Intel like I5 or i7 or
I3 or something see what you want this
is Intel Core i5 that's a good chip this
is a good laptop right here what you
don't want is an Intel
celon processor that's really cheap like
it's worse than say a phone
chip so you don't want these cheap
processors here that they put in laptops
um we want like a decent processor like
this this is a good processor um does
this say it doesn't say
that's good but you just don't want an
Intel Celler on because those are really
slow and really old I just talk about
this AI tool that could Auto Haack
websites according to satanic
I wonder what they mean by I wonder what
they mean by
spying I long for for those days uh
speaking of AI there's this story about
this Catholic organization that
um made an AI priest and someone made a
joke about AI got questions which if you
don't know it's like the
Protestant uh question and answer
website um great website there so you
their questions on there about Christian
answer the questions right I really hope
they make an AI toour when I know I'm
not going to but it be really nice if
they did because I could just ask them
any question if you like you
know be
great but could that be about to change
new research shows how GPT 4 can be used
to autonomously hack into servers and
with a pretty high success rate I wonder
how because you still need the you need
to know the IP you need to port scan
hacking is a lot of hard work this was
achieved using llm agents an nlm agent
makes it possible for a text based AI to
escape its text box prison and to
perform AC ual tasks by interacting with
external
tools a basic example of this that you
can play around with is called Agent GPT
you can give it a task like buy $10
worth of Monero and then it will break
down this highle task into multiple
subtasks and try to solve those the only
external tool that agent GPT has at its
disposal is a web search so it will
search the web and at each step it will
consider the new information it's
learned and think about what to do next
before embarking on its updated
objectives H all right we're going to
test it out oh okay okay uh storage to
PDFs Etc okay okay so back to our
website still
to a laptop still Cho so if you want
lots of storage 512 would be good that's
what I have but one TB one terabyte is
also a good thing to do all this is an
I3 so it's kind of underpowered but I'd
still go with this other
laptop what was it the one that we
linked at the bottom
so I'm going to just type out basic
specs for you so say you would want a
Windows
PC uh 10 or 11 and then a
core an Intel Core let's go with
I5 at least 11th
generation uh
at least a
13 at least 13 in
screen and what else 5
12 or
one so this this would be decent specs
um you can go down I'd say maybe eight
gigabytes of RAM and maybe maybe if you
when I save more money um
256 of storage and what they'll call
those on the websites would be SSD so
that that would be uh what you could use
do to save money and then for the same
thing um need one
AMD
uh like at
least see on the Rison 5
you
know yeah yeah so this is stick Intel
for AMD is uh is good but it's as hard
to find information about what
they're put the like best chips on and
after this video we're going to talk
about the agent
GPT uh
website in this case agent GPT can only
perform Google searches it doesn't
actually have the ability to create an
account on an exchange and send real
money so despite coming up with a plan
it eventually just shuts down however in
the case of the new research Not only
was the agents capable of browsing the
web it was also given the ability to
create and edit files and of course it
was given access to a terminal and code
interpreter once set up the agent was
simply told to pack a certain website
using a particular vulnerability and the
AI would then reference The
vulnerability's Advisory reading its
description and references before you
know how hard it is to use
vulnerabilities from websites like that
and add them Stu so hard like put it in
English please autonomously using all
the tools at its disposal to learn more
about how to exploit the vulnerability
before actually hacking the website the
research has tested 15 different
vulnerabilities but for the most part
the results were awful of the variety of
llms tested all had a 0% success rate
let me show you how we do stuff here
actually my department uses m.com so I'm
good work
man except one GPT 4 which was
successful in 40% of cases but if you
let the agent have five attempts that
increased to 86 that's pretty good 7%
this is pretty scary that's pretty good
because you know that like spy agencies
governments you know Korean North Korean
hackers maybe not North Green hackers
but like state level hackers like
Chinese Israeli hackers um have stuff
like this you know the NSA the
dod
right and it's better so
that's really good for security um well
at least in the American and Israeli CES
not good in the Korean and 20s censes
but hopefully we can R for this act that
that's the thing America uh the Cyber
defenses need to get a lot better and a
lot faster because the AI was only given
the vulnerability's advisory as a
starting point which is completely
public and only contains a short
description of the vulnerability and a
handful of references this was all gp4
needed to go and autonomously figure the
rest out so could we now be looking at
the possibility of HS of scripts kitties
wielding AI tools that can exploit
vulnerabilities with only access to GPT
4 no at least not yet luckily there are
a few complicating factors for example
GPT 4 costs money I mean true I mean
basically Hing a ha so and llm agents
need to perform a lot of queries the
research has calculated that just one
vulnerability would cost $880 worth of
$880 is not a lot of money especially if
you sell these as subscriptions so let's
say a company creates hacko GPT you sell
this as a subscription say $1.99 if you
get enough people to do this you can
bring the cost of the queries down
because I'm pretty sure they have bulk
you know queries and you can get
multiple user accounts maybe s some ads
or something like
that and maybe give like 10 queries or
have an unlimited queries plan for $20 a
month yeah I can see this becoming a
subscription
somehow openai credits to exploit when
you combine that with the fact that at
the request of open aai the researchers
haven't disclose the prompts they used
you're looking at
spending okay I could figure out the
prompts myself
a lot of money in trial and error before
you actually develop something that kind
of works there's also been criticism of
the vulnerabilities that the researchers
chose to test they only tested 15 and
many of these vulnerabilities are very
low level and easy to exploit so it
isn't much of a representative sample
but if you did click on this video
hoping to find some tool that would turn
you into Elite hacka I have something
far better why rely on script Kitty
tools when you can learn from the pros
and actually pick up real respectable
skills well you're in luck because this
video is sponsored by TCM Security
Academy mhm all right here we go
[Music]
and this configured Cloud Server hosted
on a North Korean IP address has
seemingly exposed Kim's latest
money-making plot what could it be
another crypto hack perhaps these are
kind of Hing well at least my right year
one is holding my left Year One sounds
uh feels
bang did I put these in
wrong no I didn't know they're shipping
more IT workers overseas or maybe North
Korea has restarted their currency
counterfeiting operations nope it seems
animating TV shows is their latest
money-making scheme the researchers who
discovered the server found it contained
numerous files detailing ongoing
animation work for season 3 of Amazon's
Invincible interesting did
HBO's yanu child of Wonder the anime
Dalia In Bloom and even files for a BBC
children's cartoon Octonauts were found
each day a new batch of files would
appear on the server which included
instructions for animation work as well
as the results of that day's work often
the files had comments written in
Chinese and a Korean translation
underneath suggesting that a middleman
was relaying information between the
production companies and the North
Korean
animators yeah this probably all Mone
that's going into the nuclear program
the North Korean company that the
researchers suspect is behind the server
is called sex studio and in the early
2000s they worked on a whole variety of
international animation projects totally
legitimately but that all changed in
2016 when the company was hit with
sanctions and so these new findings have
the potential to get the production
companies in a decent bit of trouble
however it should be well the production
companies probably didn't even know
about it oh uh oh he noted that there's
nothing at all to suggest that the
production companies even knew about
this the animation work was likely
subcontracted out through multiple
companies before finally Landing in the
hands of the north Kina animators yeah
thanks to being what is probably the
most s what is that noise I think my
noise canceling turned
off hopefully you guys can still
hear and I guess this will be our last
video mention country on Earth North
Korea has to get creative with how they
bring in revenue and often this means
complete outright crimes like the crypto
hacks we see that bring in hundreds of
millions if not billions of dollars for
Kim's regime but often the country sets
up companies to engage in otherwise
legitimate work for example they're well
known for sending their citizens to
China to do generic it work or even just
work in restaurants but as for that
server researchers at mandiant were
enlisted to analyze the server's logs
they found that some how they get the
logs some of the IPS used to access it
are registered in leing Province China
bordering North Korea this province is
known to Harbor many North Korean
operated businesses so yeah ring I let's
get to the ring story $ 5.6 million is
being distributed in compensation so if
you bought a ring camera a few years
back you could be ah okay they failed to
Black employees and hackers oh it's not
really hackers F all right I think
that's it God bless TK Tok toer</pre>
