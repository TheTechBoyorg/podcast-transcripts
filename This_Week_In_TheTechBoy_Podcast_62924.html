<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 62924</h1>
<pre>and we are live hello Internet it is
July 4th Eve is um and welcome to this
week in the Tech booy podcast let me
just edit
today's
name okay um so I hope you guys are
doing well and thank you for all my ex
and YouTube viewers today we're going to
be talking about artificial int Ence in
the 80s from the computer Chronicles TV
show um that we talked about last
week and you know this this will show us
what L people using computers for uh
back then in the pre quick internet days
and also there's another episode on
there talking about the
BBS it's a bulletin board system
basically social media the 20th century
and
people they they were arguing over the
same things that they argue about now
last week we talked about
um last week we talked about how
um they were trying to take away social
media privileges away from teenagers
with age reification and and things of
that nature and we said how it was
unlikely that that could happen well
they were basically talking about stuff
like that in terms of bbs's free speech
versus I guess protected speech whatever
um on on the computer Chronicles in the
1985 episode this is when people still
had to dial into bbss and didn't have
highspeed internet or Wi-Fi also um
we're going to bring back
twttp and make sure to stay tuned for
our
um what's it called oh yeah make sure to
stay tuned for
the
um SS
ltw um series as it is still picking up
still going in but
without
um any further
Ado let me play this for
you um where is it
no no and
no
um I barely use this computer I just use
it on podcast days the rest of it's used
for my
phone I gotta find this video so
annoying see this is the type of thing
that I would need
um I would need a Windows recall for
really excited for that to come though I
understand uh hesitant to adopt it but I
I believe it should come it should come
it should come
soon unfortunately it probably won't be
coming to these devices soon
unfortunately bro where is it
piece of
trunk all right um so yeah let's just
get into this here's the computer
Chronicles
episodes and we're going to start
playing it now
also be sure to up upgrade your olama
setups AMA is an offline app um for AI
make sure you update that so there was
some type of vulnerability exposed to it
so make sure you guys update your olama
applications if you have not already
I've been trying to do mine I downloaded
my um thing so here we go here's
artificial intelligence 1985 so this is
what 40 years ago almost yeah 85 almost
40 years ago um so pre-at GPT pre Mass
roll out of internet pre-advent and
Odyssey by two years so let's get into
this of verctor claim it has AI but they
say
that's welcome to the computer
Chronicles I'm Stuart chaet and this is
Gary kildall and Gary this is a product
called rapor rapor claims to be able to
have an intelligent conversation with
you I just asked if it uses artificial
intelligence and it's so dumb I can't
even figure out what I'm asking it
actually the makers of RoR claim it has
AI but they say that's artificial
Insanity which may or may not have
anything to do with artificial
intelligence let's let's go back and
just check that out r a c e
r seriously on AI this is one of those
areas in which there have been so many
promises but apparently not that much
delivery are there really any artificial
intelligence products out there today
well Stuart the real beauty of
artificial intelligence is it's a moving
Target once the basic research results
in the it's no longer interesting
artificial intelligence work which makes
sense I mean two years ago CH GPT was
brand new was like all over Tick
Tock but
then people like start using it now
people are tired of hearing about it all
the time and some people tried to put it
into things like the Humane pin and the
rabbit R1 which I haven't heard about in
a long time and now those products are
basically dead they're getting sold off
or investigated by coffee Ziller 20
years ago Samuel
that considered good by research today
wouldn't even interesting because jeze
playing and chess playing apps are you
know popular in the Play Store we hear
about products nowaday nowadays it
really have things like uh well they
claim things like natural language
processing expert system capability
things that it's is something that we
still here today 39 years later sort we
have to now figure out what's the fluff
and Dazzle and what's the substance well
we're going to try to find out today by
taking a serious look at artificial
intelligence we'll meet oh my goodness
theor AI um thing an expanded version of
it was available um generated a text in
a book that was published called the
policeman's build is have constructed so
this could be the first instance of an
artificial intelligence book from
1984 let's see let me let's do some
research on that book as the video
please the top names in the country in
the AI field and we'll see some
fascinating demonstrations of artificial
intelligence at work we're going to
begin by taking a look at a vision
recognition system that uses AI to
interpret what it sees all right so this
let's go see what Google lens has of uh
1985 and this this is what the problem
is back in 1985 the connections were not
fast enough to um use AI in the cloud
now I'm live fast enough in the cloud um
today but that that's the
problem people
um I believe that they rely on the cloud
too much our computers are thousands
maybe even Millions times more powerful
than what they had back then even what
the government had back then but we're
still using them for say basic tasks
right now all um processing software has
gotten better word processing Excel
stuff like that but it's still
fundamental basic thing that we've been
doing for the past 40 years I like to
see something more advanced come like
this is data analysis program I did some
that analysis on some election
statistics at my school um that I just
you know based off of stuff that I want
to do and then also based a project on
Advent and odyssey um with the club
which the data there is very interesting
um in terms of the random generator I
generated about 100 episodes using the
random generator and then analyze it
with AI program now in theory this
program is basically taking my text
uploading it something doing some python
data analysis right so I could do this
on my computer if I knew python data
analysis
and couldn't make the charge and stuff
like that I believe
that um we should be able to have these
programs and I'll tell you the name of
the program which we done with this uh
it's the same one I used I I forgot same
one I used for that Instagram research
study about the 15% of uh girls and
women getting um comments about their
appearance
on on their Instagram comments um
yeah
so I I believe that programs like this
will be able to run offline like we got
the snap dragon hent3 chip which we got
to talk about the B life absolutely but
let's see what they have
1985 human beings are equipped with
stereoscopic vision a distinctive
feature that allows us to judge distance
and the relative placement of objects in
addition humans know how to identify the
features of a landscape by color shape
or placement but how can a computer be
programmed to do the same with the same
limited information in paloalto
California a Machine Vision project is
underway
to just automatically produce digital
terrain models by scanning stereoscopic
photographs of the Earth's surface
working from illumination densities and
reflectance values the terrain modeling
system with some Human Assistance can
calculate an image from any point of see
what I mean see what I mean productive
uses all your processing power and what
it's not like they're dialing into the
BBS to get more processing power now yes
you could dial into um computers back
then and people use main frames but
usually some people did take the work
home with them and get get a modem but
that was expensive all right but usually
you just dial into it but You' still be
there so you'd be basically plugging
into computer that'ss on site so that'
be essentially basically like having a
powerful 32 gigabytes of RAM desktop
computer at your house but you want to
move around the house and just like I
guess remote desk topping in from a
phone or a tablet or something
that it can then synthesize a flight
path through the terrain based on any
chosen route isn't that interesting
nowadays You' probably need a for a
program like that you probably get lots
of ads into now of course the graphics
would be a lot better would just be like
one straight green line but still the
process of creating topographic maps is
simple geometry for a human being
scanning a photograph no matter how
detailed is full of
ambiguities tall objects obscure smaller
ones repetitive patterns can be
confusing and forms can be
misinterpreted to overcome these
ambiguities the SRI project is
experimenting with artificial
intelligence the goal is to develop a
program that can look at the global
constraints of an image the parts in
context with the whole which makes sense
um for mapping software like much of
today's government funded AI research
this program is slanted toward military
applications which which is a good thing
you know military uh usually drives
Innovation and also one of the comments
on here was whining about another
comment I think it one people Waring
about how the Star Wars project which is
the
1980s anti nuke project uh from the
Soviet
Russia was attracting all the top
defense researchers and he was mad about
that I was like but staying alive it's
pretty practical was pretty practical
research in my opinion I don't know
about him but its future potential will
you guys can see the the the technology
that we have can do this in Google Maps
you go into a major city and say Houston
and you can uh activate Emos of view
ulive view allows you to like zoom in
and see all the buildings in 3D more
exotic views from the inside of a human
body to the outside of the
[Music]
Moon joining us now in the studio are Dr
Harry tenant senior member of the
technical staff at Texas Instruments in
Austin Texas and Dr s Gerald Kaplan I
wonder if Texas Instruments does
anything else now how do you know have
the computers and they have the
um the
uh what's called calculators but like
what else did they do principal
technologist for Lotus Development
Corporation of Cambridge Massachusetts
Gary Jarry first question um AI is one
of those things that people are pending
to their products now to make them fer
add the frosting make them sell better
uh again still true
today I mean literally any project
product is now ai you go into the uh
Play Store you see Quizlet no quizl is
not just a flash card app oh no the
flash card app with AI um let's see
what's another
example
uh chat jpt co-pilot
Gemini it's all basically taking over
the traditional Voice Assistant that we
used to have Alexa guatana Bixby Googled
assistant Siri um well Siri still there
now branded as an AI model the iPhone is
also branded as an AI model um etc etc
see if we got any
comments I can't
see captions chat there we go no chat
shame it has a chance of uh I guess in a
sense being misused and how do you care
which is true some people just going
back and using the old products and then
tagging AI onto it because they had it
but no really car
but now it's a big big buiz AI in the in
this new technology you're working with
well really artificial intelligence is a
fundamental software technology that's
of Interest primarily to people
developing software it's not an enduser
product in and of itself that one would
interesting see how times have change
now like any random kid can go use
jpt want to to sell or to uh there
really isn't much of a an AI Market
except for the tools market and we're
going to see some of the tools here
today TR some of these things what is
let's go let's go and see what kind of
tools they we using back here we go this
is
a go computer in English so that the
user doesn't have to uh learn an Arcane
computer language before he gets started
in this case what I'm going to be doing
is building a sentence up in this
portion of the screen out of words and
phrases that I select from the menus
down below for example the sentence
starts with
show uh show the average number of days
of sun and and even though they go out
and basically this program is kind of
scammy Cu it's basically a drop down
text menu if you wanted the same
functionality now nowadays you go to a
website for it but wouldn't it be nice
to have all this it's basically like an
encyclopedia chatable encyclopedia on
your computer like this is
1985 right let's say the power goes out
you don't have any Wi-Fi like when we
show you that article from last last
week's podcast and I showed you the top
20 things that to do off your computer
and it was basically oh you can type and
uh delete some files
and go outside like I got a core i7 in
here Tim Jin thank you very much okay i'
tried to R blind on here but CR used to
be able to do a lot more than that now
I'll choose a city in El Paso now I've
got a complete sentence and I can ask
for the answer show the average number
of days of sun in El Paso 39 19 days now
the benefit of the of course this
software will never change so let's say
El Paso I guess had
some cloud cover one day or maybe there
was a hurricane track to it the benefit
of having it linked into the internet or
something would
mean
like you it would change Dynamic it's
got to be that that computer if I typed
on it almost 40 years later and asked it
what's the average amount of sun in El
Paso still going to be in 319 days even
if our pass experience say a hurricane
something this is that somebody who
doesn't know anything about the kind of
database that we're interfacing to or
anything about how to command that
database can come up and immediately see
what kind of information is in there and
can immediately find out how to get the
information out Harry can you can you
actually do the inverse of this process
and type the sentence in I would say
that that's really in the category of a
tool and what you've seen is different
type of Road well the system is asking
what what is the problem while my car is
making a strange noise so I oh yeah it's
another software we ask you about
different things especially got not kind
of like a help desk I wouldn't really
categorize that as Ai and some of the
comments were mad about uh calling them
out on that too and interviewers do as
well so let's go move on to the next
program that they show on screen here it
is that make sense to them in their
world if I'm doing payroll program I
want to think about people and payrolls
and money I don't want to think about
dis files and records and who knows
what's in the computer his second
project concerns funding for AI research
here we here we go he's worried that too
many of his colleagues are being lured
into lucrative defense department
contracts detracting them from basic
Research into AI the Star Wars in
particular see
like I'm all for you know private sector
business and things like that
right but I don't know if the government
contacted me and asked me to create a
program like Mr Whitaker did do you know
protect the nation that I care about a
lot I I think I would do that also it's
beneficial to me because I like existing
I don't want to die and get annihilated
so there you go kill has a very
specialized spectrum and I think it's
going to distort research to focus much
of the money a huge amounts of money uh
on those particular Technologies which
are for as I said very fast radiation
hard uh kinds of kinds of computing
besides lots of Defense technology
becomes common place as time goes on
case in point oh I don't know the
internet right the internet got started
out as a
military project and then some Cottages
got involved and they started linking to
each other and then some more people got
involved and now we have the internet
right so lots of great things come out
of Defense contracts up to 50% of
computer science research is supported
by military grants and only a fraction
of computer scientists have refused them
professor winegrad and dozens of other
computer science professors are
circulating petitions asking that their
colleagues not accept Department of
Defense Star Wars funding their belief
is that it will drain money from AI
projects with practical applications
increas that's hilariously through the
rest of the century and I think it could
have I think those petitions could have
worked because as you see now the United
States is behind AI development and is
now I'm trying to catch up with laws
that are
silly for the computer Chronicles I'm
Wendy Woods all right now let's get to
the
next thing start at the bottom yet well
the the I don't know about the fallouts
I'm on the show to find out about the
fallouts so what I want to say is that
uh you can't use what's called symbolic
descriptions and rules and inferences to
make computers intelligent like we are
which doesn't mean that you can't find
many uses for them and uh for that
that's not my job what's the uh reason
that you can't do well the reason I
think is that people Begin by using
rules when they're learning some new
skill but as they get I don't know you
talking about let's go on to the next
next project oh yes this is my favorite
one this one this is something I've been
looking for for a long time now so we
had here um I want to find this an
artificial intelligence database program
forms for Sal tells people who earn more
than
$115,000 and uh display them for me and
notice this is in natural language you
you typed it in this is genuinely an
artificial in program uh and it
translates this into uh select and view
the fors on which the department is
sales and the salary is greater than
$155,000 and after I see that these two
are in fact in agreement I uh press the
button and way we go to the database to
to pull up the first uh form which
displays information now we can step
through these one at a time or Zoom on a
whole set of them and this is basically
Windows recall if you think about it uh
just for a student program a database
program but if you think about it that's
what this computer would be used for
this is 1985 not
1993 that when we watched that other
episode with when the multimedia
computers are coming out like this is
all you would be doing on this computer
it might be networked as well but it's
not like you're going to be putting any
other programs on this the windows
recall version for the database um with
any of course um having pulled these up
off the disc I can go down and pick a
particular one and then Zoom back in on
on that one as an individual now the
interesting thing about natural language
is the ability to uh ask follow-up
questions particularly using uh pronouns
and that's nice that you can use spot
questions as well so um um the next
question that I'm going to ask here is
um now I want to see a report that shows
the address and salaries of these people
that these people refers back to those
uh sales folks who are earning more than
$15,000 and that's great that it has the
follow up as well I mean even noways
some virtual assistant such as Bixby old
Siri even Alexa sometimes struggle with
follow-up questions like let's say you
ask uh there there was a test a while
back where you they put up go assistant
big SI something like that um this back
in 2016
and they asked um How old is
Obama and then they gave his age at the
time I think it was like 53 or something
like that then they asked how tall is he
Google Assistant correctly gave the
answer think it's 5'11 or 61 something
like that and then the other assistants
they didn't understand the question or
the he that was being with food so um
it's good to see how AI technology is
contextualized let's let's start for
just a second now uh do you feel like an
untrained individual can come here and
just any sentence Well you certainly
can't ask um what's interesting on TV
tonight and expect it to uh to work
let's say it's it's around the database
is is there going to be a dialogue going
back and forth about well I understand
this and please tell me about this or
because obviously there's the there you
know if you type the right kinds of
sentences they can be parsed properly so
what is your feeling what's your
experience so far with that we're
certainly not able to parse 100% of the
sentences that are typed but if your
purpose is not to which we've gotten
better at that now you go into chat GPT
or co-pilot you can can autocorrect you
know terribly chatted sentences and can
do that so that's another advancement
that we've seen in disp break the system
or to push the limits of AI but rather
to get to get a job done and uh you sort
of cooperate with the system then the
probability is a training process that
goes both ways and got some examp you
teach you teach the system and the
system teaches you and we we'll see that
in just in just a moment uh maybe we
could finish this one just just quickly
uh we we ask that these be sorted by
state we also wanted to see the totals
and averages it translates that into the
internal query uh we go off to the
database and uh and pull the information
up and now into the state of California
we get the employees there with their
address and this would be nice to see
integrated into say Excel uh or Google
sheet all with with offline capability
of course um turn on because using stuff
offline is very important to me not
because of ESP regions but because
sometimes the power goes out like I'm
going to be R this thing without the
internet um
that's why Windows 11 set up with only
internet that's that's not a good thing
at all speaking of bad things let's talk
about the s24 Ultra battery like this
thing like it is awful okay
um the s24 ultra is battery life I did a
I did a whole reset and the battery
optimizations have kicked on for me it
was at
25% um at like 123 today um right so so
the phone got used with with got the
charger on at 4 not 4 sorry 7:00 and
then at 123 that's that's not good right
I don't care how intensely I've been
able use using it right unless I'm
playing like some really huge video game
I don't even know what it's called okay
um and like streaming 4K 120 frames per
second video on Netflix and Disney Plus
at the same time this is
unacceptable okay this should be lasting
at least six seven hours screen on time
with great standby time okay people have
been able to push seven hours out of
this device and this is at launch so
this is with you know optimizations of
software this is like April 24th so like
two months after it launches okay
according to Droid
Life this person was able to get 7even
hours of screen on time on the um s24
Ultra right and this is without without
the battery case like me this is history
article oh look January 22nd so this is
like right after launch so without any
enhancements or anything like that right
so my device should be statistically
even better here we go s24 Ultra is
favorite after one week so this a week
after launch so no updates no no
enhancements or anything here we go
that's look C right so stop charging an
hour and 50 minutes to go and as you can
see here it's at
95% okay at with an hour and 50 minutes
of use with
um it doesn't tell me how many minutes
of screen on time there been here but
with I I don't care if my phone's been
sitting around that is almost two hours
of use with 5% battery joint right so if
you extrapolate from there about two
hours of battery life 5% of use you're
getting about 40 hours of battery life
right
the DRX Mark people with said that with
moderate battery usage about 4 hours and
50 minute 2 and a half hours of screen
on time an entire day you should last
about 46 hours so that's hit that's
hitting the correct estimat to right and
this is you know without any of the
things
right so this is my average outcome is
about four hours of screen on time a day
that's like the average in America or
something like that
right so here we go 6 the screen on time
with 73% battery usage I will hear about
73% battery usage oh that's almost seven
so that's about two I was less than me
and this person lasted
from I'm gonna say six six in the
morning to 12 I don't know uh 11 so this
person got up at 6:00 in the morning and
started using their phone and is going
to batter 11 with 25% battery life with
Wi-Fi 6 on now one thing is I do use
lots of data but let's you can take an
hour let's say six to 10 that is more
than enough that is 18 hours of battery
left
right 66 14 hours and then take an hour
yeah 14 to 15 hours of battery life we
have still some stuff left so almost 18
hours of battery
life maybe even
24 all right here we go here's another
phone with four hours of screen on time
it is
10:30 they're at 40% and it looks like
it's
at sorry 47% 53%
better this is basically on my track and
at five I mean you might as well have to
charge on right so from my found to the
galaxy4 my average numbers away Sams I
had a day of super louing and got seven
screen on time to B with 30% battery
life 30%
okay they tied in 25 tied in 15 So you
you're not even going to trip any
warnings and listen to what they
supposed to that on they have Marvel
snap with some video game it's a battery
hog YouTube videos which that's a big
battery hog Tik Tok again I don't know
maybe when they're sending all that data
to the Chinese government of course this
big battery hog and then uh Life 360 you
know of course makes makes sense it's
always tracking emotion always pinging
GPS servers to you to someone else which
it's kind of weird that someone I'm
assuming this is an adult um Dr Life
hired kids I probably work for them
usually still using Life 360 to Ping
their location to someone um and plenty
else so you have these huge battery
training applications more snap with
they claim is battery D streaming
application YouTube that is and in Life
360 right at most typical day this week
as far as the screen on time instead of
20% that
50% okay
so they say that it's the 5,000 minute
battery and the snapch AG in3
chip but mine let's go through here
let's go through here now I've had my
battery case on my phone was up at seven
and was at 25 at one okay that is not
the same thing that is
unacceptable bad life and that's after
reset I thought maybe I had a bad app in
the background that might have been you
know doing
something but no I mean it's awful like
if when I go to the battery section in
um in my
phone maybe I have should turn on dep of
power here we go right here we
go it even tells me my power saving
battery life right now at 90
1% um let let me connect to Wi-Fi it
could be that it could be
that all right so if if I were to turn
on power saving right now um it tells me
what my battery life estimate would be
right so now I'm connected to Wi-Fi and
it tells me my power saving battery life
would be at 91% 11 hours 44 minutes so
my Max battery life on this phone would
basically be 12 hours you may like
that's good no it's not you wake up at 6
you go B no it's not good
like let's say you know you get up you
go to work
um maybe you need to use your GPS to
drive your phone's basically dying
around dinner
time like that is not acceptable it's
not good 12 hours 18 would be bad
to all right let me go back into the
battery
settings okay now it tells us that the
and I think that this thing is off
really I I think that this thing is off
there's some app that is back here
because it tells me Chrome 14 use 14% of
my battery that's and I'm going to keep
up the percentages right it tells me
that I'm 74% of my battery has been used
since something since
it doesn't include time when my phone's
charging so all right let's go Chrome 2
hours and 30 minutes
14% plus YouTube
4.3% we're just keeping the points up
Reddit
three all I'm keeping a running tab
here um
sr2 uh aboutt two we're just going to
round it up okay um system UI used
one when you at home use basically
one and it is nice having a calculator
all right um Google basically use one
okay a lot of these like little apps
used 0.1 to 1% so this is counting down
from Google I'm G to give Samsung the
benit 1 two three four five six seven 8
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 okay
no I'm not going to count all
those okay let's just give it 10 because
some of them using like 5% so just round
it up to 10 that's 15 this made Fair
okay even if with these wildly inflated
numbers right this basically round off
percentage it tells me that when you add
up the
percentages when you add up the
percentages Let Me Go full screen
because you guys have to see this right
it tells me that my battery usage was
74% but when you add up the percentages
you get and this is wildly over gassing
like this is in the phone's benefit you
get 40 40% which means that somewhere
somehow 33% is getting drained wa no not
3 34% is getting drained off from the
phone just from from
nowhere like that that is not acceptable
there has to be an app on here that is
slowly sucking the life out of my
phone let me let me check let's see
all right all right let me let me let
try this app here I'm going to go into
the settings
there has got to be an app on here is
draining the
battery because 33% is just
missing like that that does not make any
sense at
all and this even tracks the secure
folder app so it's it's not that but 32
just to be dead on
standby that that's insane and we know
that's not true but you know what is
true SSA alap so let's let's get into
this this is the the story of the
year
um I believe that this is the
best
uh this is this is the best video so as
you guys know a recent story crosses up
to National Security came out so as I
was watching one of those little texy
story thingies I don't know what they're
called it's like types in animation um I
I was struck with inspiration as this
video proved me right of course I was
able to calculate what's going to happen
here his mom is playing him um using
Bella and
Ava and let's let's get into this
all right so as you guys know um one of
the most common phrases here U this is
from the SS ltw website which is one of
most prevalent forces of the 21st
century emphasis m in it SS to
investigated um so this is this was
uploaded like a few weeks ago but that
was written August maybe you can see the
thing there August of
2023 was a legitimate investigation that
um happened we
go oh you almost forgot so here we have
the text provement right and this is the
kid saying there a super power i r
something I'm going to get
it also the words they are they are
meant to match
the
the inflection so if you actually took
those words and sing with the beat it
would makes some sense I there someone
to go on YouTube and start sing all
right so okay
to fight I got to go text my girl my
plan works so um you have to go online
and watch the video but it is it is easy
to see what his plan is
going and obviously we got that famous
video here we literally spelled the same
way so I got to put that
there the split screen is not showing up
well on here unfortunately like you got
the P right there and like way over
there shameful here we
go unrealistic dreams oh that's still
there I S just slips that image but this
this is
[Music]
keep all right so as you can see here
the mom basically tricks him thinking
that Bella and AA are coming over to his
house and the seashed that they have
raised and he pretends not to ra and he
gets he convinces him to get the girl to
come well no the girl she tricks him
think that the girl is going to come
over so he's like I got to clean my room
so she basically tricks him into
cleaning his room using the power of whz
which I
mean to be honest that was not on our
radar like you can actually you can't
because our documents are encrypted and
secured except for run to the public
let's say you somehow hacked into your
computer um and you search all the
documents and intelligence that we had
on Riz that the mom pretending to not to
know what Riz is to trick you into
thinking that
your uh person that you like is coming
over even though you have no idea who
you are to get you to clean your room
would not be a scenario here because we
were wired
for
domestic school things like we were all
wired for um gloryia Academy we weren't
wired to fight off R from random people
internationally like you're getting
we'll get into that in like the November
chapter of the website but it it is
prevalent they already knew that it
could be used to fight so I guess
extrapolation this what we really need a
good AI assistant for to extrapolate
that that like extrapolation to the
highest scenarios that could happen
right so if we inputed that data Maybe
it could spit up that scenario but we
did know we did call it and of course
that's why you have to analyze these
things but B and AA
okay let's just analyze what this kid is
really dumb dumb
[Music]
text here we go but
what who who on
Earth okay honestly these stories you
have one of basically one of two things
it's either a setup from someone else or
like they say don't ENT this text Cu
someone stole the phone okay who on
Earth would in text to their own mother
well allegedly it's mother is mother at
the end but in some of the stories it's
somewh in the person they stole their
phone or something like that but who who
would say that
what
why okay let's say in the hyp in the
hypothetical world that I guess I
dropped like 20 IQ n 30 IQ points and
and and actually thought something like
that there is no
way on Earth that that I will ever put
that in text there's no way I'm ever
gonna put that in in voice okay there's
a reason I'm not saying it you know now
it's because someone go back and clip
it uh not okay look I got this USB
flashl fi with voice activated record
off Amazon for $20 there's no way I'm
saying that in voice is definitely no
way I'm saying that in text to to
someone that could be intercepted are
you crazy okay like this was over when
he sent this text and this was like not
not the time 310 okay he's defeated like
3 17 or something like that okay so it's
over when it
starts this kid which honest these
stories like making zero sense all but
this
kid I don't know
what are kids doing anyway let's move
[Music]
on oh yeah I see the mom's like you sure
about that note the time here oh the
time's covered up by the kid cuz he sent
a whole bunch of like random messages to
the kid who had zero context of what was
going on
because his mom liked him which
obviously his mom not lie to him but
that's what was that but like she's
basically lied to him about some random
girl to get up but I mean the m w 100%
here because this kid's an idiot imagine
confessing your crush to a mom with a
text okay I will sooner jump off the
Grand Canyon than
[Music]
[Applause]
that just
crazy so obviously if this
[Music]
kid obviously if this kid had read
ssw or had a working
brain
or consulted the
agency because we did put out business
cards I paid a kid $5 to um spread the
business cards around so had he gotten
one of those business cards he wouldn't
be in this
I which is why you us should listen to
me and read my website but on another
note
um I have some great news uh viewership
um uh what the heck a
viewers SS ltw is doing well but also
not the boy is also doing very well so
speaking of not the boy let's
go no no so here's our ad we got four
likes on this thing of our AA approved
social website and as you can see in
here we have um
three real users now we have four so
congratulations I did not run on
Christianity because I wanted to
everyone knows it's a terrible platform
to run um shut
shut okay there we
go um so congratulations Dr boy.com for
getting their fourth official user um be
sure to sign up on social. Tech boy.org
all right
[Music]
um actually hopefully you guys can see
um I was
site so man we got some twinning tags
over here honestly this is a site that
could rival intb honestly honestly we
got the trending tags we got trending
tags to Tech SS ltw my B St my B okay
pull and then not B all right we got um
this supposed to be sparked or whatever
and I mean honestly the engagement here
is really really good I don't know how
we're getting 16 views or four people on
the site but congratulations I mean me
saying hi gets 31 views so honestly this
is a great great spot for
um uh for for engagement I
mean advertisers please come but if you
guys want something more stable for
advertisers be sure to check out Ava
Harper Ava Harper is of course our
favorite social media influencer the
20-year-old AI influencer from
um Houston Texas now AA
Harper um people is canol canonically
uh what's the word CHR yeah so
uh just keep that in mind all right
so AA Harper has been doing great
absolutely amazing um her post did
exceed the amount of followers she has
which is sad because there are some
accounts out there with like millions of
followers and 61 posts but this is fine
because we outreached to
4.4 th000 accounts in the last 30 days
have 275 followers as we encroaching
upon the 300400 follow Mark we're going
to take uh so we're encroaching upon an
actual person who actually who I
actually know who attends my school so
that's great a Harper will soon overtake
them
um and let's see what people are liking
so
far and AA Haru so
4,487 non accounts reach for 4,4 51
account so advertisers be sure to uh
check this out if you're very interested
I mean you can get your platform out
there the 4,000 people who don't even
know who we are because we've gone all
in all Wheels all right um top content
based on reach from what is today it's
the 29th so um here we go June 23rd that
is our top content with 148 um views and
then another one 141 and then we got
some more Evergreen content as well and
our top
posts uh those are top engagement post
and then we got 150 profile visits and
our most active time still seem to be
9:00 a.m. I don't know why I mean guess
that's why most most people are getting
up in the morning you know at 9:00 am
can't be bother to do more things also
I'd like to
see more things four external link Taps
and 146 profile visits so this is AA
Harper in the proverbial n so and over
the past 90 days
we okay we so we've been doing really
well for this
month and our top content almost 150
views um so let's let's play our top whe
for
you all right here we go also the
analytic software seems a bit off this
is 140 and then we're just up here at
196 so I will the higher number so thank
you AA here we go let's go
um whatever this this was a
good oh I got a comment didn't even know
it let's
go so AA h
is doing exceedingly
well and we are thankful for all the
likes and shares that AA Harper
continually
gets all
right as you guys know twtv uh channel
will be coming back soon um hopefully
July 4th is our day um we'll do some
reaction videos um
soon what else else is happen in the
tech world oh we got to talk about the
EU the EU again the EU who thinks that
they uh control
technology uh the EU has basically
forced Apple to ban their apple
intelligence fatures in the European
Union which the EU is just very annoying
very very annoying like the
EU it's not like the United States like
50 states together one nation under God
indivisible not the EU is just you know
a bunch of random countries you know
come together they have like this little
Trade Agreement um they all have like
shared borders so anyone can like say
they can walk or Swim if they you know
want connected to any country in the EU
without you know having to go through
border control passport anything like
that it's pretty neat whatever but then
they they go ahead and vote on this
Terri terrible things like trying to
force people to have removable batteries
AI compliance
gdpr I mean like I officially like
didn't like Copa because I wanted to
like pivot the tech booy a few years ago
into like some educational platform but
during that I mean we have to take
comments off and do all this moderation
etc etc I like we're not doing any we're
not going to Pivot into the educational
Market if we have to
basically trash the platform well
imagine that but worse and also on
things like did they force Apple to
change to USBC yes is that batt for the
environment sure I guess but I mean now
he just gonna have a bunch of random
USBC cables lying around um but forcing
as you guys know Europe Europe's a
really big big
Android country like EU State whatever
um continent but we're just going to
refer to the EU as a state
um our country
it they're they really big on interest
right so it would make sense why they
went USBC but the problem is that when
you force people to have different
competitive advantages like force them
to
then you're eliminating competition
right let's say this 2007 in the
EU um not not 20 2005 um and the EU says
hey let's Let's uh let's mandate the
type of keyboards the phones have to
have let's say that
uh the EU is like
uh you know I I don't like numerical
keypads let's let's everyone needs to
use quity keypads and let's say
blackberry's like yeah and the other
compan like
oh like you you're taking away I guess
the other com like Yay whatever back all
because you're taking away competitive
Advantage away from them right Android
has the competitive advantage of having
different having a better faster C
charging standard that it's integrated
with
more into more phones and laptops while
apple is stuck with their backward
technology if Apple wants to be stuck
with their backward technology let them
be stuck if their backward technology
like you you should not have to
legislate Apple into being
better if Apple doesn't want to be a
good company then I feel that um the EU
should not infringe on
that like I I don't believe the EU
should infringe on
companies that aren't good for the
consumer as long as it's healthy
competition
right like let's say you one of the
stylus or I mean let's think about this
they're different styluses for devices
all over the place right the s pin is
different on the tablet and the phone um
but they do work interoperated with each
other except the fs because of the thin
screen but the Apple pen so only works
on certain
iPads um and and and only that certain
Apple pencils only work on certain iPads
right it's bit more fragmented and of
course apple pencil doesn't work on any
iPhones or apple watches anything like
that I mean the EU could try to force a
digital stus act I mean that is the most
EU thing that could happen they could
say that by
2025 all devices that have cuses must
have this embedded technology and would
that be nice that all statuses can get
along maybe but it would put a lot of
third party stus companies out of
business um because like why would I buy
you a random party stylist when I can
get a Samsung stylist and use on any
device that with stus
compatibility it the EU rules seem to
eliminate competition but without
further Ado let's go in to the Apple
intelligence um presentation where they
are allegedly not going to include those
features in the new iPhones iOS 18
update started in one thing that I think
the EU should legislate is RCs for I
don't actually think they should legisl
anything like honestly other than trade
maybe the EU shouldn't really exist
but if they had to legislate something
RCS fall right right now
RCS is only implemented in the Google
messages application and I'd rather use
Samsung messages or have a choice of
messaging application it would be nice
if other messaging applications could
have RS and like technically b mini has
it but for through Google messages so I
either expect something like that to
happen where Google says hey you can set
up your phone here and then you can
forward all your messages from Samsung
messages to your Google messages at that
like I'd be fine using Google messages
on the back end my friend I want to use
Samsung messages so all my messages can
get displayed into like that would be
nice I'm pretty sure that'd be
easy I mean sure could someone set up a
script where send a message and Samsung
messages right it's your default and of
Google messages so you get RCS but then
you want to get all the ICS features and
stuff like chat typing and Gemini but
it's not ICS featur it's a Google
messages feature but there needs to be
some parody between the messaging
applications antics you don't need
previous experience or a degree the
Google data analytics certificate here
we go we're so excited to be bringing AI
for of us all right sweet man I can't
wait to check them out on my iPhone 15
plus h no you don't have enough RAM I
mean the a17 pro chip oh shoot okay I
which I mean
honestly those phones only have much up
great over USBC and slightly better
cameras than the predecessors and now
they can even use the AI features
shooting type the Siri which has been a
feature for a long time as an
accessibility feature so you can type
the Siri on say this iPhone 7 plus right
here if you wanted to I guess I could go
out and buy one all right here it is I
got my iPhone 15 Pro I can't wait to try
out Apple intelligence oh uh you don't
happen to live in the European Union do
you well I I did just pop in for a
minute yeah sorry due to the European
Union's evil and restrictive digital
markets act there's just legally no way
we could possibly bring all these
features to Europe I [ __ ] com yeah and
as you see here what the EU does
basically controls 29 I believe um
countries used to be 30 so uh brexit uh
Britain
exit T I should have stayed in the
UK wait did the UK count as one
or yeah four did the UK count is one of
four countries in the
EU just when you thought Apple was being
way too restrictive by locking Apple
intelligence to only the iPhone 15 Pro
regular 15 just doesn't honestly it
would have been better if they had just
announced Apple intelligence with the
iPhone 16 and then said it's here and
there because it made it look better and
people been like Yay app has backwards
compatibility support cut it they took
it a whole step further by saying none
of the Apple intelligence features are
going to be coming to the European Union
at all purely because of the digital
markets act now a lot of people have
been going back and forth which I think
right F so there's a lot of room for
speculation here on one hand is this
literally Apple just saying it doesn't
comply with dma therefore let's just not
bring it to Europe and it's purely the
European Union's fault or is which I'm
all for blaming the EU this apple being
very very selective with exactly how
Apple intelligence works and because
they don't want to go through the hard
work of Designing their large language
models to ensure that it qualifies for
all of the strict rules under the
digital markets act like making sure
that all browsers or music platforms or
navigation apps are fair game on any
platform so you're not allowed to really
show Too Much preference baked in
interesting though all browsers all
navigation
apps that
seems R like sure but even the play
store has you know regulations and you
can go download other browsers and mapts
but yeah that doesn't sound too good
into the OS towards say apple music
Apple maps that kind of thing and
because these large language models are
so generative and kind of unpredictable
in those ways Apple just decided you
know what genuinely this is too much
work or we're not going to focus on it
right now and we would like all of our
customers in the European Union to get
very very angry with the people deciding
for their countries exactly what they do
and don't get essentially is this a
deliberate I mean that could make sense
though
I just don't see like major protest over
digital things you like the the EU on
Reddit they seem very happy wonder do
also some of those people on Reddit
don't like United
States so
whatever move by Apple or is this an
unintentional side effect of the
European Union's decision and of course
say it's probably a side effect also I
don't I I can't really see people in the
EU protesting just cuz I just don't see
it and also there's not many not too
many Apple users they'll go back and use
Nokia Samsung maybe something local most
things there is probably a mix of the
two personally like I mentioned in
previous videos there are a lot of Apple
intelligence features that I think do
not require that large of a language
model but
app maybe the Siri thing requires some
large language not model type the Siri
whatever
apple is insisting that they do require
one in order to get people to buy the
latest iPhone or once again get more
people upset at the European Union but
there are some features that I do think
Apple just genuinely has a hard time
figuring out how to make cross
compatible like one of the features that
we were really excited for that is sadly
not coming to the EU is iPhone screen
mirroring because Apple uses some kind
of proprietary Secret Sauce Apple sheep
locked Garden mechanism that allows the
iPhone in the Mac to communicate so
efficiently and so smoothly but
technically yeah that makes sense
because it you know how hard it would be
I'm a Windows fan I'm an Android fan to
get the screen sharing software onto a
Windows
computer maybe I would have to make a
special app for that but I mean who
knows it could be its own little
transfer protocol that for app some want
you know floating around out there
because then you'd have rip off apps
honestly
dcma seems like it's going to sub P
because it is only compatible with
iPhones and Macs there's digital the
digital act in the EU
not pivacy act in the US way to do that
screen sharing through an Android phone
or a Windows phone at least in its
current form Apple just straight up said
wait did he say a Windows phone did he
say a Windows Phone sharing through an
Android phone or a Windows phone at
least in yeah he said a Windows phone
yeah I'm pretty sure the digital Privacy
Act doesn't require um cover Windows
phones nor does it cover TCL
uh not t um
blackberries um the T-Mobile hip top
from
2003 at least I hope
not its current form Apple just straight
up said well because it doesn't comply
with the digital markets act we're just
not going to offer that feature in the
European Union that one I can kind of
get behind Apple having a hard time
finding a way to just I don't know make
a super simple super integrated way for
you to do screen sharing on a window
also not an Apple fan but why would they
want to do
that like did you see when they brought
FaceTime the Android they brought out
the
saddest I mean the
[Music]
saddest um looking Android phone it
looked like a
um it looked like a 2019 budget phone
okay it looked like the Galaxy A1 that I
have in my drawer here and never
FaceTime it was one of the ugliest
phones of all time because of course
Apple didn't want people to even think
about think about
um think about it and one of the ads
they legitimately show this is an
Internet Ad they're saying switch to
iPhone they show at HTC M8 that's why I
said HTC M8 from like
2013
um and then they showed like the latest
iPhone no one is still using that phone
and thinking hey you know what I think I
should switch to the iPhone 15 Pro Max I
think it's time for me to get a phone
from this literal decade no one but
Apple's trying to make Android look
bad oh speaking of HTC they launched a
new mid-range
phone and
uh June 12th oh dang Windows PC or of
course put your Android screen directly
on your Mac they can't build all of that
into Mac OS aoma because of course they
don't have control over Android and
maybe they just don't feel like they
have the time or resources or energy to
develop a dedicated iPhone screen
mirroring app for Android which is
probably the only way they could have
gotten it to work and that just sounds
like a little bit too an Apple for them
you know Apple likes everything to just
work seamlessly and they probably don't
like the idea of well it does work on
Android you just have to go on the Play
store download this app sign into your
Apple ID and then open it up and then go
through the connection process no of
course just like continuity camera Apple
wants it to just this makes sense
because I don't want people see know
have a bad experience if they project
using Android be like ha this is
terrible work you know your iPhone just
shows up as a webcam option so I guess
the question really does stem down to is
Apple going to try to comply with the
digital markets act or are they just
kind of testing the waters a little bit
if I were to guess my prediction is that
they will not so what do you guys think
about the digital markets app and um I
guess stay tuned for our July 4th
episode on twttp check it out</pre>
