<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 42024</h1>
<pre>hello oh
wait hello and welcome to the tech boy
This Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast Hello everybody welcome to this
weekend the tech boy podcast it just
came back from
first
first
world's first championship
let's see who
won um oh I guess they don't have the
teams you w up yet let's see but
whatever the good news is that it wasn't
as they didn't have as many Pride Flags
last year no that's not that much of an
accomplishment last year as you saw from
the Vlog and part
it was in everybody's pocket and
everything I think we
can pull it
up let's
see but this year it was only like half
as much but they did have hats with that
on it so yeah lots of stuff happened in
the tech booy
news this
week we had our second ever AI gener
article um about
the wow
dang wow let's look at this on the
screen we had our first ever AI second
ever air generated article about the
Galaxy A35 and Brett Cooper launched a l
of phone cases and apparently people
cared about that uh it was a very
popular article so um maybe so some
airpod cases too unfortunately those
phone cases is only one for the s24 and
just the s24 and then they have like
lots of iPhone models but only one just
for the s24 not the s24 ultra s24 plus
not even the s23 series and only Samsung
so that's the only android model that
they have kind of sad
um
yeah let's see what else happened in
Tech news this
week oh yeah the shy Experia is coming
out also Mark Rober apparently attended
first World's Championship yesterday but
I was at school but he was there and
apparently the CIA and the Department of
Defense were also there can't believe it
all the fun stuff I missed out on
um
yeah let's watch this
satanic
video If you guys don't know satanic is
a cyber security YouTuber based out of
the great state just kidding country the
UK um oh wow my uh headphones they sound
good today
they completely ruined my life you see
I've been in the great your Discord
messages are probably up for sale a
website claims to be selling four
billion Discord messages for as little
as 10 cents also 10 cents is crazy
though I mean I read the comments and
it's not like your private Discord
messages it's your personal ones and
personal servers I mean at that
point it's
just what's it called it's basically
like an index is basically
Google when you're hacking use Roundup
telegram has a pretty serious but also a
pretty silly vulnerability oh hopefully
it's not a like a thing that like I
don't care if my telegram Conta I would
care is if it make my phone get hacked
to delete that the iMessage got hacked
or did it but first spy. pets is a
website that probably has your Discord
messages up for sale the website claims
to have scraped thousands of Discord
servers millions of users and billions
of messages and they've made all this
data searchable well provided you're
willing to pay for the privilege and no
there's a good chance this site is not
very legal and Discord themselves aren't
too happy with it pretty sure it's very
I'm pretty sure it's legal I mean it may
violated the terms of service but
scraping public web data or data that
people allow you to access
is legal right it's not like they hacked
in the Discord servers and then
downloaded that that would be
illegal but more on that in a bit spy up
pets is actually a very well put
together websites and on the surface has
the feel of something legit H the site
seems like it's down for
now discover a Fresh Approach to find
Discord users say goodbye to endless
Searchers and hello to effortless
Discovery they emphasize user privacy
which seems odd given exposing
everyone's Discord messages is the exact
opposite of privacy and I've actually
had to blur out this part of the web
page because every time you refresh
someone else's messages are exposed so
it's clear that this promise of enhanced
user privacy only applies to spy pets
paying customers speaking of which
creating an account is as simple as
generating an account number which
actually feels very similar to mad's
approach but unlike mulvad spy Pets only
accept cryptocurrency as payment
interesting and I of course had to at
least try this out for research purposes
of course and bought $5 worth of credits
in Monero whilst I was waiting for that
transaction to process I had a browse of
the servers spy pet is apparently
tracking and it very quickly became
clear just how they're grabbing all this
data they simply have an army of bots
disguised as real users which join
servers and then creep on messages you
send within that specific server so
again I'm not sure how that's illegal
it's not like they're getting in do
password or anything like that there's
no vulnerability being exploited here
and importantly your private messages
are all completely unaffected I searched
a few users and spy pet returns a basic
profile like the servers they're active
on and connected accounts but more
worryingly it has a log of all the
messages you've sent on servers that spy
pet has bots on and this even includes a
log of your activity in voice chat
however if you have a small server with
a few friends those messages are very
unlikely to be here but messages you
send on midsize and larger servers are a
different story you could make the
arguments that none of this really
matters I mean the traditional forums
that Discord has replaced pretty much
all have a searchable Archive of some
sort but the difference here is that no
one treats Discord messages like they'll
be around permanently so you get a lot
of spicy conversations that's kind of
their fault
like that's kind of a d problem in my
opinion that few people would want to be
made public however there is a link to
request the removal of your data but
don't get your hopes up because that
just redirects to a certain clip from
Spider-Man you serious spy. pet is only
few months old it launched in November
last year and has kind of gone under the
radar well until a few days ago when an
investigation by 404 media put a
spotlight on it with it since getting a
hell of a lot of attention it's not
clear who runs the site all we know is
that they're interested in making money
and are even open to so-called
Enterprise customers interested in
training an AI model with Discord
messages are you a group of federal
agents looking for a new source of Intel
or maybe something else we've got you
covered so it's not I'm pretty sure
already have something that can do that
for them you don't think the feds
thought of that no not hard to see why
Discord itself isn't too happy with the
site they told for for media that
they're investigating and will take
steps to enforce their policies don't
know how they're going to make that
illegal like what what are they going to
do like put in a cater seems like your
cater is not working policies which are
very clear that scraping data is
certainly not allowed again that's not
legal legal
like consent that's
just please don't do that I will I will
kick you off but regardless of discord's
terms of service not giving people a way
to remove their data doesn't sound very
gdpr friendly and the facts that many
Discord users are gdpr only applies to
Europe doesn't it
so just don't allow them to access from
Europe R rage further complicates how
the data is allowed to be processed you
don't know where the servers are so it
doesn't again doesn't so yeah this is
potentially well almost certainly a
legal nightmare for the owner of the
site Who currently remains Anonymous and
the site is already under attack for one
reason or another as on their Blog the
owner has complained of having to deal
with various Doos attacks spy. pet is in
essence a data broker data Brokers are
companies that scrape the web your
personal Data before packaging it up and
selling it on to well who knows while
spy. pets might be doing this in Legally
questionable ways there are thousands of
legal data Brokers out there selling
your info to other companies or in some
cases just random individuals who are
willing to stump up a couple dollars for
a person search and the kinds of
information that data Brokers hoard can
be pretty scary and whilst today's
sponsor delete me can't get spy. pets to
bin your messages they can definitely
help let me show you how we do stuff
around here actually my department uses
m.com so I'm good work telegram has had
a spot of trouble last week rumors began
circulating of a zero vulnerability in
telegram's desktop app for Windows a
demonstration video shared on hacking
fors shows someone clicking on some
image they received only for their
calculator app to open instead if this
video is genuine things could be bad
very bad because it implies that all
hackers need to do in order to execute
arbitrary code on your PC and thereby
pone your computer is simply trick you
into clicking on what looks like an
image telegram however disputed these
claims saying they can't confirm that
such a vulnerability even exists and
that this video is just like that is
true you'd have to still be a pretty
good hacker to get that to work because
like you'd have to have the Spy program
already under clear hoax In fairness it
is quite common for these kind of bold
claims to turn out to be false and
recently happened with viral news of a
zero day vulnerability in Signal it was
just totally false and in this case
there were no technical details released
alongside the video so the claim of some
awful vulnerability was widely dismissed
however that all quickly changed the
vulnerability was confirmed to be true
and the source of the problem was
exposed you see when you receive a
potentially dangerous file like an exe
as you'd expect telegram pops up kind of
this oh that's from telegram warnings of
possible impen ending Doom this happens
because as we can see in telegram source
code it keeps a list of dangerous file
extensions here you'll find all The
Usual Suspects like exe app Bat and so
on but a simple typo in one of those
extensions Pi wz which is meant to be Pi
ZW meant that files with this extension
weren't being treated with a suspicion
that they deserve Pi ZW is a type of
python file and without being on that
makes sense because then they get
encode list it means that they can be
opened within telegram just as easy as
an image or video can but it gets worse
security research has demonstrated how
with telegram bot trickery these files
can actually be disguised as innocuous
files like videos making it easy to
trick someone into clicking on them and
this could have had pretty dramatic
consequences given just how telegram is
the messaging app of choice for many
cyber criminals activists and everything
in between dang that's unfortunate
hopefully the NSA and CIA all those
agencies got their hands on this
vulnerability so that everyone didn't
hack into the Cyber criminals
scammers uh oh the only catch here is
that for a PW file to run on a victim
computer the computer needs to have the
python interpreter installed which never
mind of course doesn't come on Windows
by default thankfully as soon as this
bug was confirmed true the typo was
quickly fixed and in the meantime whilst
everyone updates a server side patch
changes the extension in real time so
the files just won't run but in a post
telegram actually downplayed the bug
saying that less than 0.01% of our users
have python installed and used the
relevant version of telegram for desktop
but this statement in of itself opened a
whole other can of worms I mean how did
telegram arrive at this figure does
telegram scan your computer for
installed software likely not I mean
realistically they probably just made
this number up but regardless there
aren't any known instances of this I'm
pretty sure that they just saying like
how many people have piped on on their
computer yeah you like that random kid
from school or something is going to
have Pip no bug actually being abused in
the wild before it was patched speaking
of bugs in messaging apps iMessage has
had its own drama this week when trust
wallet uhoh and we're back the team is
looking down the barrel of a 455
meeting it's tweeted of credible Intel
regarding a high-risk zero day exploit
targeting iMessage
oh it's beautiful it's so beautiful this
is the Holy Grail of exploits and is the
kind of thing that a hacker could use to
break into your phone by send any iPhone
any it's the stuff of dreams you an
infected text message meanwhile you'd
have no idea that's in the background an
attacker could be tracking your location
grabbing your two FAA codes or oh it's
beautiful nudes okay that's just stupid
why would you have n on your phone
like it's no surprise that this warning
came from a crypto wallet company High
net worth crypto hodlers need to be
particularly wary of hacks like this
because if they end up falling into the
hands of cyber criminals these guys are
realistically some of the few people
actually worth targeting with an explo
like this because of course every time a
zero day is used there's a chance Apple
might discover and Patch it so
honestly would probably be better to
Target like a whole bunch of random
people just Generate random phone
numbers steal a lot of data and sell it
pretend to be them still this isn't
saying I'm saying that would be more
valuable I'm saying you prob shouldn't
do that because you know it's illegal
but when a 2fa code is the only thing
standing in the way of a multi-million
dollar payout burning that zero day
might actually make sense news of this
hack got millions of views and spread
like wildfire but how credible is this
Intel not very it seems this dark
website is the source of the news code
breach lab they claim to be selling the
iOS exploits that's caused all this
drama
$2
million are you kidding me heck that $2
million they also have a WhatsApp
exploit going for 1 million with other
exploits apparently coming soon not much
is known about Cod breach lab the only
reference to it I could find on the
cleet is some guy on breach forums just
asking if it's legit and the site itself
in particular the about section reaks of
AI generated nonsense so it looks like
trust wallets have created a bunch of
drama over just some scam sites that we
can realistically put in the same
category as those Hitman for higher
darket sites that exists only to scam
the fools who believe them this is no
different finding vulnerabilities like
this is actually really quite difficult
Advanced spyware companies often have
hundreds of hackers on payroll in order
to develop these exploits with any
frequency at all so for some unknown
sites to claim to have a couple for sale
and many others in the works is a bit of
a stretch the site is also very badly
designed if you tap on the iMessage
exploit and actually try to buy it the
place order button doesn't work unless
you have JavaScript enabled so this is a
very low tier scam site that is clearly
not designed for the dark web and
there's a good chance it was just
entirely made with chat gbt or something
unsurprisingly no one has actually sent
crypto to the scammer's Bitcoin address
with trust wallet seemingly being the
only people who are tricked by the scam
oh as always thanks well that's great
for iPhone users unfortunate for
hackers um yeah
let's see if you got any comments nope
no comments
yet okay stop
sharing let's go back to the tech
boy.org there're still T to raise money
to uh get a new phone maybe s23
ultra um we have enough money to get OMG
cables but unfortunately they won't let
us combine gift cards so that's not good
so so what and but unfortunately we
don't have enough money to get a
flipper flipper Z I saw one online for
$89 but the um website didn't look
legitimate well I'm not sure I didn't
want to waste my
$90 all right let's talk about printers
once again raised their prices in
response we're bringing back our def
here we
go obvious you're not gonna watch this
whole
thing we got a video on YouTube from
2003 that is just a delight it is so
oddly narrated it's like the Gman from
halflife is talking about color printing
take a listen to some of this you bubble
jet printer technology aims for the
ideal combination of digital photo
printing
capabilities enhanced photo image
quality and high-speed printing
performance precise smooth and natural
realistic photo image quality Canon's
new microfine droplet technology
positions the heaters directly above the
ink ejection
opening I've heard some odd sounding uh
Tech video narrations but that's a
special see what happens to it a BJ
cartridge error has old computer here
Cur install it properly and close the
front cover
well um that that tells me nothing
install it properly I mean there are
other parts in here right but it didn't
it doesn't say anywhere that I can find
uh where to put these
things yeah it straight up doesn't say
anything about putting these extra
pieces in there yeah there's like
Springs and things popping out of here
oh what the heck I can see what's
setting it up and what happens to
it oh it's just him trying to set up a
printer well that's that's interesting
not not that interesting
but let's see what well well well what
do we have here what else happened in
technology news
here's another cyber security video I
guess we're G have a cyber security
theme today oh oh
oh no
no as you can see this if you've been
keeping up on Android news you would
know this is a big computer is also very
slow so we're about eighth of the way
they able to get like say s24 Plus or
s23 Ultra or anything like that so if
you want to support the channel be sure
to do that here we
go here we go let's
go the scammer who uses deep fakes over
Zoom to scam some company out of 26
million United States dollars
in the early 2000s Kevin mittnik scoured
trash cans for personal information so
he found logins and passwords written
down on pieces of paper important facts
is even personal phone numbers of Stars
For example Christina
Aguilera thanks to ENT scammers no
longer need to do such Dirty Work and
with the help of AI tools scammers are
basically more active now than ever uh
oh small internet scammers prefer a mass
approach and wait
these AI tools like if I type in AI deep
F you got to pay for all this stuff and
they have all these regulations in
place buys
it more serious scammers are masters of
ENT they often choose a specific
direction to look for victims and study
it for example scammers are targeting
government agencies or to large
commercial
companies the Hong Kong scam started
with a letter we don't know which email
the first letter came to work or
personal it doesn't matter at all it's
easy to find them if you
want companies off what emails or
letters leave employee emails on the
website and if not there will always be
a
way hi I'm actually I'm so sorry I'm
trying to log into our account for uses
information and I can't remember what
email address we used to log the account
a couple of minutes and this girl
received another person's personal email
and even persuaded the operator to reset
the
password but what is important wow seems
like like the higher up you go like I I
went somewhere and I saw like all these
computers linked into each other and
they had these kiosks right and the
kiosks were um jacked into the wall and
connected to the internet I was thinking
oh well like and they had lots of
cameras but I you can like pretend to
tie your shoe like they didn't like this
an Odyssey episode where Vance King and
his son are like trying to hack into the
bank computer system and siphon out the
money well if you go like the hack five
store they actually have
this thing called a shark Jack and it
allows you to jack into a network and um
I guess like this say you have EET
access here you go shark check you just
instead of like having like hack into
the Wi-Fi you just like plug in like
Ethan attack and then you already have
access and then you can access things on
the network now I've read a lot about
hacking and things like that but I
always wonder like how you access the
other computers on the network and how
you can like see the screens and stuff
like that so here you can stru check in
like via the cable which is kind of
useful but then like you'd have
to you know stay there and then they
also a wireless one which has a computer
inside of it and they run payloads on
there with a network scanner
and you can you know wirly connect to
it I have an ebook I'm working on my
book soon it's come out in a few months
up to page 17 it's very very interesting
yep yep yep okay now we have to go in
human
AR the Wi-Fi free zone you have to
register to not get get Wi-Fi maybe they
make the free Wi-Fi
zone both are white
huh I'm very
confused go back in 2001 security
systems don't run in like Windows XP all
you have to do is I we have experts for
that but I mean if you running Windows
XP right now you're kind of
scoy
nope El legal security measures what the
guns okay
he wait is two people dating him at the
same
time I think once again
kids kids once again we've been proven
in
correct I can't believe that actually
worked now and also this my reminds me
of an advention Odyssey
episode that we need to talk
about I don't remember which one it was
but I posted about another one on my uh
on you know on the Avent Odyssey fan
website that we run
here and oh my
goodness we need to talk about that but
let me go
check
the let me go check the adventures and
odyssey Club history that I have on
here wait wait wait wait speaking of the
event Odyssey
Club oh no yeah have Focus on the Family
Colorado Spring headquarters where they
have wit in is closed for six weeks
witch in is
closed at least the bookstore is open
though which is apparently
awardwinning oh
no
usernames have also been limited to 25
alpha numeric
characters so that's it's kind of
sad wa let's
see
no triangle web hand up accid
of
impossible maybe it was uh
the triangled web that was oh my gosh
that episode was a
mess but speaking of oh my go still on
the Shar Jack thingy and let's just
watch this there you
go is this port
active does it I wonder if this works
for phone ports too look at an IP
address on the
land what VLAN is it
what else is on this network this
reminds me of that scene from when
uh Eugene hacks into the hotel's
computer system to find out
if the um W Katrina's in by pluging into
the phone line I wonder how he did that
just
like would it stand up to a little
stress
testing what if I could find out right
now
[Music]
hey I wonder if do we even have those in
our house like I know we have them but
they're probably all on the router or
where the TV
is so what do you find out
the shark Jack is portable powerful oh
I'm glad that thing's portable USBC
charging just flip the switch and Jack
into a network to execute payloads in
seconds with instant feedback from the
RGB LED and Cloud C2 for remote access
and exfiltration or get a root shell on
this keychain Linux
box but what else does it do like is it
just a network
scanner shark Jack take them very
interesting all right now let's go back
to our video and then we're going to
talk about this Advent and Odyssey
episode which honestly proves me right
once again protocols go to hell Sherlock
is
in the detective acted effectively he
found the correct Target assessed its
vulnerabilities and chose the right
nerve for manipulation everybody has a
nerve interesting though I
mean what if she they weren't dating
each other then how would he get it like
that's not you can't date every random
personal assistant something that
prevents you from thinking critically
causes a lot of emotions makes you act
thoughtlessly and so
on letter us from remind you that the
attack in Hong Kong began with a letter
from the company's United Kingdom based
CFO did you notice that we said that the
clerk suspected something was wrong but
nevertheless continued with
correspondence based on the official
statement of the Hong Kong police one
might think that the nerve of the scam
is that quote scammers prey on company
employees by pretending to be their
bosses since subordinates usually cannot
distract their
superiors if we translate the police
statements into scientific language then
the success of the scam is to blame for
the high power distance index PDI for
short the PDI clearly shows how much a
particular culture values
hierarchy simply put can a subordinate
easily turn to his boss take initiative
Express his opinion doubts and so on in
Hong Kong PDI is 68 for comparison in
England it is 35 in Denmark it is
generally 8
I wonder what it is in the US this
characteristic was developed by the
Dutch sociologist GE
hoffstead Professor hoffstead conducted
a large study among IBM employees he
visited the company's branches around
the world and asked employees how they
resolve conflicts how they work together
and how they relate to their
superiors the result of hofstead
research tour was a system for analyzing
differences between cultures PDI is one
of the features in his system system
hoffstead was amazed that within the
same company people think and behave
completely differently in fact I was
able to show that it it wasn't IBM it
was the country that's accounted for the
differences yes each of us has our own
unique personality but it is
superimposed on the traditions and
habits of the
[Music]
society this phase is the most difficult
for scammers because a it is necessary
to bring the victim to a certain State
before the call so that the person does
everything the scammers need and B we
need to collect material to prepare deep
fakes for the main part of the scam the
video I wonder how you deep fake at Zoom
calledo like you'd have to get everyone
talking you'd have to clone their voices
in Chinese I think unless they have the
meeting in English and
then you'd also have
to you know know what to say make it
sound like them it's pretty high
level we know that the victim
communicated with the scammers for
several days moreover we assume that
communication went on almost
nonstop this is done to put the victim
into a kind of Trance so that she
doesn't have time to think critically
about what's going on let's take a
closer look at Deep fakes so we know
that on the call with the clerk there
was a fake Chief Financial Officer of
the London head office and several other
colleagues how were deep fakes made the
information reported by the media varies
version one frauders made deep fakes
from open materials on the internet
which is of course more than
possible yeah actually uh in the past
three months just got the videos we've
seen more defects than in the past
couple of years the there is two types
of
fraud he's going to go do like the type
technology you
go disguise a malicious program so that
the installation is as undetectable as
possible thus having received a picture
from real calls with colleagues scammers
could make real time deep
face Bloomberg experts are almost sure
that the fraud in Hong Kong was carried
out using real time deep fakes I want to
with you okay I'm really want to meet
with you this is one of the reason why
I'm coming over to Canada because the
clerk's colleagues nodded their heads
during the call and also said some
random remarks while the financial
director gave out
orders maybe didn't have to talk that
much but just you know
[Music]
we do not know what exactly was
contained in the correspondence between
the scammers and the clerk and what the
clerk was told on the call but it is
obvious that a presidential scam was
played out for the victim this scam
scenario has caused billions of dollars
in losses
worldwide but its author is Gilbert
shley he is a worldclass liar
wow is he like a professional liar
the early 2000s he was looking for ways
to get rich quick and had an epiphany on
July the 7th 2005 while watching a TV
report of a series of bombings in London
lipo Street
Station Gilbert clearly sensed which
topic would unsettle even the coolest
people for a long time to
come we are united in our
resolve to confront and defeat this
terrorism that is not an attack on one
nation but on All Nations within two
weeks shley called his first victim
French Press called her Madame G she was
patient
zero we analyzed the attack script on
Madame G just like program code so that
you can see the number of attacking
commands Okay so what did they do Madame
G was 45 years old okay she worked as
director of the post office in in Paris
France's national Postal Service lost
also operates as a bank on Monday
afternoon she received a call from the
head of
leost it was a big surprise that Jean
Paul bile never phoned her directly it
was many layers above doesn't remind you
of
anything he told her that the government
had evidence that terrorists were using
an account at her Branch to finance
terrorist attacks throughout
Europe so Madam G suddenly plunged into
a top secret anti-terrorist
operation an international secret
service agent will phone you I'm
counting on you to get uh oh ah yes
random top secret
spies call me all the time you
know I'm counting on you to give him all
the information he needs Bailey told her
the agent he should probably know this
information called an hour later Paul
said mission is a closely guarded secret
Madame G herself is under surveillance
at one point he asked if the date May
the 5th 1993 meant anything to her
H interesting
this is the day her father
died Madame G's doubts wonder if that
was a password or something disappeared
a random person could not know this in
fact Gilbert was told this by Madame G's
elderly mother whom he called under some
stupid pretext and chatted with her for
more than an hour oh on Paul's orders
the woman purchased a new mobile phone
the agent told her to keep it on at all
times and expect to hear from him at any
time a few phone calls
later later Paul asked her to list the
names of the branch customers with the
most money in their accounts when she
did this he said that the list confirmed
his suspicions one of them had
connections with
terrorists Paul said that we need to set
a trap with her
help several times Madame G said that
too much was asked of her she was scared
but Paul persisted he said he was
counting on her the French state was
counting on her Madame G gave up on
Thursday at 10:00 in the morning she
left the lapost branch with a bag full
of money
then she got into a tax she did let her
take money out of the bank and just give
it to random people that's kind of a
bank problem see to the first designated
point the Canon DEA Nation
Restaurant Paul phoned her every 2
minutes and she had to answer upon
arrival he ordered her to go to the
restroom of the restaurant and wait in a
booth a few moments later there was a
knock on the cubicle door the female
agent actually Gilbert's accomplice and
lover whisper the password
Reeve Madame G handed over the back she
waited in the toilet for a while and
then headed to the next CA infe on the
other side of the city Paul said that
while she was driving his colleagues
would discreetly Mark the money and
return it to her at the second Point
Madame G did everything exactly
according to the
instructions she
waited 5 minutes P wonder how you got
Madam G's number did you just call like
some random
like the see receptionist 10 15 Paul
stopped
calling Gilbert shley loved to give
interviews and boast about his method of
deception wait how did he not get
arrested to succeed he needed a little
information about his victim and a phone
number by 2009 French police counted 30
cases of helped the government catch
terrorist scams the amount of damage is
60 Mill ion EUR wow but that was only
among those who contacted the police
then Gilbert put the business
spe
this on stream he rented an office hired
50 people who phoned and introduced
themselves as
CEOs how did he not get arrested for the
head Gilbert was arrested for a scenario
with the French minister of defense that
scam was the first time a realistic mask
was used according to the scenario the
French Minister of Defense asked to
borrow large sums from the most
influential people in order to rescue
journalists captured by terrorists
frauders recreated The Minister's office
you can see a flag in the background a
pile of papers on the table wow and an
old school phone true the mask left much
to be
desired the head was disproportionate to
the body instead really of eyes there
were two black
holes however this slightly creepy fake
Minister successfully convinced
influential people to transfer millions
of oh yeah it's this like 2009 notle the
quity would be that good Vios via Skype
the saddest part of this story is how
much admiration there was for
Gilbert a movie was made about him in
documentaries let me
see about shley even the police call him
a genius he putts people in a movie his
Defenders said about him now Gilbert is
imprison but he lived beautifully and
with impunity for a very long time while
his victims lost
everything for example Madame G after
what's happened she was fired in
disgrace she lost her home there is only
that's kind of unfortunate it's kind of
like the banks SP it's like letting
random people bring books books uh money
lying
around on Sunday morning the clerk is
called to answer the
Bell first the victim seiz the boss he
looks like he's a little out of his
element which confuses the clerk the
clerk's other colleagues then join the
call he knew some of them personally
this cleared his doubts he probably
should have asked them personal
questions that they haven't have known
it's very very easy to create um if I
can stream it quick demonstration so I
have a um Google meet with my friend and
I also have a uh streaming software that
uh creates a virtual camera I can
actually choose the the video that I
have created here so you can start
virtual camera and then if I go to a
Google meet then here so it's obviously
me this is my typical background with
the um TV Tower and then here TV tower
for in since I go there here you see
that oh so you get to change the um you
get to change the
camera I switch from my uh regular
MacBook camera
to a v camera and here you see it's
pretty good defect so you can if you
really look really closely you can see
this is defect you can see there there
are certain artifact with the ice
but it can be convincing especially I
wonder how have made it real time
I like I wonder how they did it in real
time what software
all
if you're tired if you're stressed and
then plus voice deep fakes um so Etc so
you're in trouble you will fall for that
for my uh meeting software it was
possible to detect that virtual camera
was used for me as a person or for my
friend she couldn't do it uh for
instance when we do verification checks
uh BR cameras um checked so probably
there is a signal of FR but
unfortunately frers know about it and
they try to hide their as much as they
can so try to pretend this is this is a
legit makes sense let's return to our
attack during the call the clerk was not
allowed to get a word in the fake
Financial Officer gave orders about
where and how to make transfers and
ended the meeting in a hurry could the
clerk on the call notice that he was
talking to a deep
fake well I believe that the attack was
targeted so fro respect
all right so yeah that's real time deep
fake attacks be safe and careful out
there um you guys see what
else happened in Tech
news oh I saw a Tesla Road to today I
think was the original one so it had an
iPod in it and also the
uh what's it called the Cyber truck live
in in person second time I've ever seen
it oh nothing launched the new phone uh
watch want to check out the infinix note
40 Pro Plus and it's still a budget from
the name that big but a
shame you may be getting more familiar
with this category of tech a are glasses
or at the very least they can be
considered second screen glasses they
are
definitely yeah it got a bit of a glow
up this one's kind of fun the folks at
infinix sent this over this is the I
hope they send me something I've asked
them for stuff before note 40 Pro Plus
5G the next iteration of the note lineup
why do they call them notes they don't
even have
pins have changed quite a bit in terms
of design and aesthetic infinix has been
making some killer options more
affordable options but packed full of
bellsa a lot of what I think is kind of
interesting about the design top of the
phone I mean this is an interesting
design looks like it's flat still have
that IR Blaster and that JBL speaker
logo here on the top bottom of the phone
we got that USBC I'm going to pull out
the SIM card it's a dual SIM so that's
pretty nifty there no micro SD card but
I am reviewing the 256 GB version of
thisone I know they put here like 24 I
wish I had 256 gab giggle bits of ram
but what we're really doing is 12 plus
12 so there's 12 gigabytes of actual Ram
which
is actually pretty good for a phone in
this segment and then 12 it's pretty
good for any phone gigabytes of a swap
space that uses your storage just as
sort of a temporary hold over I'm not
the kind of don't know why you eat 24
gigs of RAM though guy who likes to
discuss that feel in the hand most of
these products are welld designed for
evolved primates with opposable thumbs
okay we're not primat and we're not
evolved but whatever all right here we
go let's get to the haptics and instead
we've got something
that distinct little pulse and pop to it
I prefer something that's just a little
bit more distinct and a little bit more
responsive to onscreen actions as
opposed to something that's rattling
let's get testing we had the case and
the charger nice that it comes with the
case and charger though yeah I'm not
going to can us and because we don't
have that headphone jack they do include
these like sort of ear also nice of them
wish I had
some pod style earbuds there's a little
USBC plugin right there so you can
connect them directly to the USBC port
on your phone it's a nice admission that
they're removing something from the
phone itself I just I just Samsung used
to include those with their phones like
on the s20 we still had these kinds of
options where a pair of cabled
headphones can go you a long way and now
even on our less expensive phones
there's the expectation that we'll be
stepping up to significantly more
expensive bluetooth earbuds getting into
the performance and this is a nice
little uptick over the note 30 let me
see Pro that I reviewed before I always
got to laugh when we're showing off
these geek bench scores and like oh
we've got two clusters of CPU cores and
ones at 2 gigahertz and ones at 2.2
gigahertz and and these numbers right
here they tell you literally nothing the
Improvement in this new mediatech chip
over the previous year's phone is that
we've stepped up the two bigger cores
are more powerful bigger cores we've
gone from a76 cores to a78 cores and
this has had you a nice little nudge
it's not a radical difference it's not a
night and day difference but it's a nice
little just bump into our CPU scores
unsurprisingly our single core scores
now are closing in on performance from
back in the Snapdragon 865 days and so
basically like a note 20 Ultra very
anecdotally in the hand compared against
the note 30 Pro this phone is a little
snappier it's a little more performant
and it can get a slightly higher tier of
work done but on this new mediatech
we're dealing with a different GPU and
unfortunately this is a GPU that is
currently borking on a lot of geek
bench's uh measurements this V score
we're talking about synthetic Benchmark
number scores here not only does this
not really tell you much of anything
it's also just telling you the phone
wasn't able to properly complete the the
geekbench test Suite so maybe it die oh
checking out a slightly older game but
one that oh it's a game Mo like why is
it
so blocky still kind of has some uh
beefy Graphics to it we would still hope
to see around 60 frame per second frame
rates here in a game like implosion it's
got like sort of last gen Graphics but
something that's still meteor than a lot
of your just sort of gotcha you know
microtransaction casual gaming the
infinix here is doing a really good job
Graphics look pretty good to job of
keeping up with this so even though
we're we're definitely having some
issues with uh oh I don't know what's
the purpose of this game oh gotta Dodge
gotta Dodge oh there's lots of force
feedback coming from this uh oh gotta
move Gotta Move there's a lot of uh
vibration control coming ah I missed
that que I used to be really good at
this game it's been a while since I've
played it but uh there's there's lots of
that vibration motor haptic uh response
let me see if I can kill this guy all
right all right this is good but I'm not
better again than what we would
expect like because you can't
expectations that playing those games as
long as you can tweak some of the uh
some of the quality settings that should
be perfectly capable
that this is doing a lot better than I
was expecting it would in testing the
phone the radio performance has been
really solid but one of the things that
has been annoying is how aggressive the
phone can be in interrupting background
tasks for example I would not like that
example I'm trying to download something
from my Nas and in leaving this to then
go look at like some gaming performance
that's annoying like every time I'm
editing video like for school and then I
have to go in and download something
like the we graphic or like some clips
from online and then I come back it
always out of the editor and I thought
oh maybe my phone has a ram issue or
storage but maybe it's just the software
it's the Samsung so I'm not sure me the
game even though I've got 12 gigs of RAM
it interrupted the background download
here which really shouldn't have been
taking up a lot of space and memory it's
those kinds of things like you know it
helps manage the performance of the
phone so the phone feels snappier in the
moment when you're using that one app
but even with the extra RAM and this
backup 12 + 12 swap space that's going
on here it I still find that it's a
little more difficult to keep these
kinds of uh these kinds of apps running
in the background and a quick tour
around the software we've got that 120
HZ display and like I said the the
slight differences in CPU design here
really do add up to a smooth Sleek
feeling experience um infinix has AI
Gallery what significantly cleaned up
their UI this is a very heavy and
aggressive skin but we've got like fun
this skin looks normal just looks like
you put in some
you know theming icons and then you just
swipe up and get to the normal and
features for different types of folders
the layout is just buttery smooth
everything is kind of flowing the way
that you would expect it to you're not
sort of lagging or or waiting for the
phone to catch up to your commands and
we're adding those other lifestyle
elements like so many phone
manufacturers are coming out with these
little side docks that you can get in oh
wow great man samung said this is like
2015 to additional functionality quick
easy access to commonly used apps and
screenshot oo that's note for stuff
right there and Screen recordings I mean
stuff that I think people are are doing
more and more and more the thing that
still bugs me is when we have this one
of my favorite features of Samsung is
the uh the screenshot in the edge panel
where you can like screenshot stuff as a
square or a circle it's really useful
when I'm screen grabbing uh stuff from
the
newscast I really don't like how
specific the gesture needs to be when
you're reaching because also I like
being able to tell the uh the skin so
the launcher here uh when you do a swipe
down from the middle it usually brings
up a search but now I've told it to pull
down my
notifications but that's not my it kind
of looks like the OnePlus though you
have slide actions and toggles I would
really like to be able to just pull and
then have my most commonly used quick
actions here at the top that is the
Android way to do things if I wanted an
iPhone I would go and buy an iPhone I
just think it's kind of annoying that
there's an expectation that on a tall
skinny phone someone is going to be
super precise about what side of the
screen they're going to pull this
gesture from and if you're off that edge
by just a little bit what happens is it
just
pulls the notification so if I wanted my
quick actions and toggles but I didn't
quite reach the upper edge with my
little Stumpy thumb well oh I guess I've
got to do that and it's an additional
gesture to swipe that over I have to use
extra gestures when I'm really out and
about to try and get to those different
features and settings but yeah that's
kind of annoying even though it's
inexpensive there are a lot of really
fun additional settings that people
should check out this is not a stripped
Bare Bones inexpensive kind of device
there are a lot of things let's see what
we have here Smart Hub X clone kids mode
game mode smart panel
it's basically like Samsung things in
here to check out from cloning apps
having a dedicated kids mode some of the
gaming improvements that you can bring
up multitasking and floating windows all
of this is brought into the settings in
a very clear and distinct fashion yeah
this phone looks like pretty useful um
let's go check Best Buy listings for
unlocked sell
phone what happened to my camera
