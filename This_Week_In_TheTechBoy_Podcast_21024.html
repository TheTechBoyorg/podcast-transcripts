<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 21024</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech booy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
everyone watching live and welcome to
the replay crew today we have plenty of
AI topics to discuss including Google's
Project Gemini gets launched I installed
an APK version of it and replace it with
Google Assistant to see what happens and
it's you know it's kind of mad um we got
to talk about the worst Tech scams of
the decade thank you Mr who's the boss
and then of course we have our three
headline no two headlines to get to from
the tech boy.org oh and I almost forgot
Apple Vision Pro releases and daily wild
host um call it societal collapse and
they they just got to get nuked by me
I'm sorry those are the rules I mean
it's sad that we are having to defend
Apple but when Tech gets attacked the
tech Boy comes to the Rescue all right
so here are top headlines of the year I
mean of
the of the week changing someone shirt
in Adobe Firefly we would have the
chains picture from this but it didn't
download for some reason and I can't
show it to you live because we also ran
out of credits and how to activate the
built-in o you're on Windows 11 just by
screenshotting so make sure you check
out those articles right now live and in
person and now is as good a time as
ever to
um to talk about the Apple Vision Pro
which as loyal listeners know is a mixed
reality AR I me AR yeah AR headset made
by Apple right AR stands for augmented
reality right and tech fans and
listeners know that augmented reality
means that it's an
overlay goes on to the
screen so you can see the world around
you and you can still see your content
right now an A short example of this
would be kind of like that feature on
your Samsung phone thank you Samsung
when you can um
use the camera while seeing what's
behind the
screen is that's not exactly AR but it's
a
uh it's it's
a it's a it's a
way um so what you have to do
is you just actually G to put it up here
I'm G to talk about the Spy
camera where is it spy
camera
Samsung I can put up the article later
but we got to talk about uh the the
review copy
link of oh he actually has a visual
talking about the problem with Apple's
visual Pro oh oh my
gosh that's that's that's going to be
something I mean it is literally and I
respect the guy I like him he has decent
takes most of the time but it is
literally his brand to hate everything
made in the past 20 30 years of
Technology right he's like hey kid
shouldn't have phones heck um he said
quote
um phone manufacturers should be m
mandated to remove the calling function
from all phones except for kid's phones
in which the only function of their
phones should be calling and then said
well better yet kids didn't have phones
anyway which whatever okay but let us
let us uh read this here please do not
wear a screen directly on your face
allow yourself to experience physical
reality it's actually important for us
to fully inhabit and engage of the
external world around us believe it or
not okay now as dumb as the Apple Vision
Pro
is first of all it is an Ari headset so
you can still see and engage with the
physical world around you okay I mean it
is basically kind of like combining
airpod and iPhone right I mean you could
argue that you'd be more aware of your
surroundings when you are wearing a
Vision Pro then when you're on your
iPhone because if your Vision Pro since
the screen's directly in front of your
face you can see what's going on in
front of you however with your iPhone
you're always looking down now this
isn't saying that you should wear one in
public but we shouldn't publicly shame
those who do wear them in public which
um he said they would now as you can see
here it costs
$3,500 okay so it's not like people just
going to be buying these and all the
like all the kids are just going to be
buying these off right um like me say oh
how can they afford $1,000 iPhones well
hey the parents are paying it for them
and it's on a subscript and plan because
it's it's an actual phone you evision
Pro is not a phone it's more akin to a
home theater experience right you can
link it to your Mac computer have like a
5k monitor you can use it it's it's more
of an inhome product personal computer
so think of it as a replacement for an
iPad essentially just without all the
like productivity minded things it's a
it's a new category of the replaces but
let's just go with that it is your own
personal theater essentially brought to
you by Apple that has messaging
capabilities and other V style
applications so you can see like more
most of gaming and everything like this
right
well so people these will not replace
your cell phones okay and he doesn't
even understand what argumented reality
is so I don't think he gets a place to
talk about the Apple Vision Pro like he
said augmented reality quote and we
talked about this in the summer when
Apple released the Apple Vision Pro you
said app augment reality it's saying
that you need to augment your reality
augment means to make it better they're
saying that Apple's device can make it
better um no that's not what augmented
reality is now um now it can be debated
if having iMessage on your face and
being able to take 3d pictures on your
face makes your reality better for some
people yes for some people no right
um
it yeah so for some people yes for some
people no now here it is is his clip
from his show it's called the problem of
the Apple Vision Pro which of course
he's going to cancel this but I'm going
to cancel him because it is Apple has
just released when you see people like
just Just For No Good Reason No Good
Reason saying hey this is a bad piece of
technology because it's going to inhibit
societal collapse uh no the Apple Vision
probe is not going to inhibit societal
collapse okay it is a 3,000 piece of
tech piece of technology is a wearable
face computer okay I mean
I do realize that I do sound like that
lady from uh noon the Noom PR
representative where where she's telling
talking to Mr whu talking about uh how
how he's against the Nova box and how
the Nova box isn't impr proven hasn't
gone through any of the testing and how
Mr W could would have been against the
radio and the television and everything
if he was coming out of this the thing
is in novacom a the technology was
stolen B um the technology was being
used to uh mind control apple is not
trying to mind control users with the
Apple Vision Pro it shouldn't be a hot
take but it probably is all right now
here's the clip from the show which is
filmed on a I don't know why it's shot
like this this this supposed to be a
short but they uploaded it wrong or
something called the Apple Vision Pro
The Vision Pro is essentially a slightly
more advanced version of meta's VR
headsets so it's a giant hunk of metal
and plastic that you you put on your
face tracks your hands allows you to
interact with virtual apps so you may
have seen videos of people influencers
using this thing in public he's right
he's right and the influencers and
pictures and videos everything's used in
public okay it's true here's what that
looks like
[Applause]
watch this is obviously staged and shot
I mean look at it this person's wearing
a Le jacket with a $3,000 computer on
her face right if someone did that in
real life they're going to get beat up
okay this is obviously staged
this is also for the cool and novel
Factor right and again this may look
weird to outside observers but remember
the people inside the headset can still
see each other and interact with each
other in fact it is better for your neck
position and it is better for your back
position to have that on your face than
it is to be looking down at a phone not
saying that looking down on the phone is
bad I'm just saying that it
is I mean if you go to a chiropractor
they' say looking Straight Ahead at a
monitor is better than looking down on a
monitor I mean does it look crazy yes so
people move on with it yes I mean let's
assume let's take this out of the
question and I say had a laptop here
would anyone care no right like these
people don't care about him or who he is
not like if he didn't have that thing on
his face he'd start having a nice
discussion with it it can it could be
argued that that thing there is a more
of a conversation starter than using a
phone or a laptop because people going
to want to ask you about the Apple
Vision Pro and then you can pivot and
talk about other the things there too
also this thing is probably heavy and it
only has a 2our battery life right so
these s obviously
stag okay good so if you want to look
like a schizophrenic on the subway you
wear one of
those anyway like this this this is the
problem we've got to embrace new
technology okay here's another take here
from a website talking about these
people um using the Apple Vision
Pro and it's the first guy who got
one and it is obviously a take it is
obviously a bit these people are apples
uh apples PR people standing outside and
clapping for him and this guy just
starts yapping I I mean I like this
writer but I have no idea what he is
babbling on and on about he start
talking about how he needs to teach his
children about the lordship of Jesus
Christ because he saw this I'm like wait
what what are you what are you talking
about like it's just a face computer
calm down I mean the the amount of hate
I mean remember I am the fan of Android
I created Team 13 okay I I created I I I
am Samsung's number one fan
okay the things that you have to do to
make me publicly the F Apple for five
minutes on uh on a uh YouTube stream is
insane like what did you
do like I am not an apple Defender right
Apple now I guess when you get to like
the stupid
uh USBC thing like I actually didn't
want that to happen because then it
would make Android phone still better
but still like I guess I defended Apple
there from
the from the EU right
but the EU is just annoying okay like
the EU is just annoying with all the
regulations and stuff uh especially if
in technology like trying to mandate
removal batteries mandate uh USBC like
just shut up and make govern your own
country
um anyway here we go I don't even know
what this says consume consume me
consume consume look I can read it's
just that has like 13 million O's in it
so I can't really okay says the first
person to rock out of the Apple Store of
the Apple Vision Pro gets a big round of
applause okay these obviously Apple
people okay I mean look at those batches
okay well you think people just these
people here to sit there and and the
cameras are there and he's holding it up
and everything this is obviously staged
right Bros maybe the V Pro is just a
useful piece of tech but this is just an
embarrassment an embarrassment for what
he bought a revolutionary piece of
technology at Apple St it is not common
for people to stand outside and wait for
the newest iPhone to Dr it it's uncommon
now but when the first iPhone was came
out like this is this is a revolutionary
piece of technology right is I mean to
the extent that it's been hyped up to it
I mean yes you can get AR glasses that
syn to your phone and would be a lot
more useful and better on battery and
better on connectivity and everything
but they're made by companies like XV
and Vivo and no one's ever heard about
them okay this is the first consumer
grade
AR headset thing made by a trillion
dollar company right here we go this is
painfully hard to watch okay let's watch
you let's watch you okay I I don't
[Applause]
[Music]
know wow I'm just dying couldn't have
made it through that video I mean I mean
that that that was
just yeah obviously this video is fine
okay here we
go next time my uh todler grabs Apple
sus from the pant right create the
energy here U
okay let me look at these
demos can't believe I used to think this
stuff is
School uh yeah no what like what what
does this take like the amount of hate
like just just if you don't like it just
say you don't like it and I'll agree
with you like whatever go get an XO go
get a Vivo get a go get a beam but I
mean just just like I mean nuking the
guy my
goodness like okay and then of course
black cooper you know reacted to her
before you know fan to her I guess uh
she you know she hates AI see I mean
just like can we just have nice things
please that's all I'm saying so uh
that's why you people over there
canceling the Apple Vision Pro because
it looks weird it's G to be an
existential threat to society uh all
today cancel so yeah all right now let's
move on to something a lot
more interesting I
guess we got to talk about the
um uh what tech FS per use B all right
now here we go so today I mean not today
this week I learned that um with a SDR
you can get some someone's ismi number
using a GSM catcher on Ki Linux now it's
kind of hard and I install the software
but I didn't get anything so I might
need a better SDR that goes into other
things but if with the ismi number and
the cell ID and the Lac and MNC and all
these other things that you get on there
you can type it into website and get the
approximate location and then with some
other software you can also intercept
text and stuff which is illegal but if
you use a passive one since you're not
transmitting on anything you can get
this information and find it out so you
know how in like uh in like those movies
that kids watch middle school high
school movies when like the protagonist
as like some girl that they ran into
like over and then they dropped a bunch
of stuff and then the girl's hair is
flying in slow motion and then like they
like then the last like hour of the
movies just like all Sinners around
trying to get them to the middle school
dance well yeah those type of movies I
don't know what they call bomc no not
called BCS it's like high school middle
school movies whatever um
and like how they like asked the girl
for a phone number but what if you what
in like a hacker movie they did the same
thing and then they asked for the ismi
number and then they like track phone
that'd be a very interesting movie all
right anyway um on to the tech
fails most evil Tech fails and ex has
something to say about here about the
Tex code of the United States which um
honestly is not evil I mean it's just
genius companies if genius companies can
figure out how they face tax codes
legally I mean that's wait for them less
money they have to pay like I don't know
how it's evil like you go figure out a
way to evade them yourself online don't
spend another dime on Amazon here we go
fake products false advertising but he's
in England so like it doesn't really
count cuz
like ruthless scams these are the 13
most evil Tech fails that through
Instant Karma have completely backfired
for the we probably not going to go
through all of them so first let's do to
uh here we go Nokia Lum Lum Lumia 920
they really wanted to emphasize the
power of the 920s optical image
stabilization So speaking of O I was
playing with the iPhone 13 yesterday te
game uh last game of season we won
congratulations team uh and I I was at
like 0. n time zoom and then one time
zoom because it was the iPhone 13 right
so at 0.9 time zoom is do using the
point five time zoom camera but and
digitally Zoom again it looked like it
had no ois at all like it was all
graining and shaking and everything this
like with mini five face into my hand
and at one time zom which look exactly
the same except all the lines are clear
but nothing was shaking so I'm wondering
like ultra white Cam was sneak they need
a lot more love I mean they've been
around for like eight years since 2016
on the LG v20 so they created this
situation where a guy was holding the
phone on his bike and he was using the
phone to record this girl on another
bike but okay
um what is this who on earth
right no no viewers noticed something a
little Sinister Al how do you get a 920
his phone's been around for like 12
years the video the reflection of a
person who is not the original cyclist
holding the phone but in fact a
completely different I mean that's
that's great
uh who pays that much attention to a
commercial guy standing in a van holding
a profit they had a magic Rao a heavy
duty film camera and that's because the
video wasn't really filmed on the 920
fil camera still looks pretty good what
it is all right now I'm GNA go to want
to talk about nfts Netflix kind of Point
okay here we go EA game gaming is not
audience let's see here oh I mean look
at this game here I actually kind of
wanted to play this game like now when I
saw it because I didn't know about it
until now but I mean looks kind of fun I
don't even game they made the games that
landed them on this list the same can't
be said for raw raw was a massively
multiplayer online life simulator that
was promising enormous things the
initial trailer showed off entire towns
with a full doesn't this look fun I've
always wanted to do something like this
economy where every player has a job can
purchase property and vehicles and take
out contracts with other players you can
even be the mayor and govern your server
it basically looked like GTA online but
with a 100 times the number of complex
systems and mechanics the trailers were
flashy and and well animated but it was
all cinematics not real gameplay that
said it did not stop a lot of people
from backing the prodject on Kick I
wonder how they knew that like instead
of a cinematic nightville gameplay oh
maybe it's like a like you know flying
needing the game to easily surpass the
nearly $80,000 that the company was
asking for in funding a lot of money
absolutely enough to develop a game this
sprawling not even close what these guys
were trying to do here would have cost
tens of millions of dollars and needed
100 develop can you even fund raise 10
million on kickstarted like is that a
minimum how many look at these people
you got a
cat these minus
only two they had two people all signs
were pointing towards scam and they so
nearly got away with it but it was greed
it was trying to convince people that
they were actually working on something
hoping they could squeeze out just a
little bit more in Kickstarter funding
they made a F mistake they released a
Gameplay trailer of the game that didn't
exist and as soon as the internet saw it
people immediately realized that the it
looks janky but I mean it looks like a
game but I'm not a I'm not a gamer so
all thing from the furniture to the
players Running Animation were all stock
assets clearly just pulled together from
the unity asset store that people would
use as a base to actually build a game
upon Kickstarter suspended their funding
immediately and also slapped them with a
fine of the total value of everything
they've raised so far now you might have
recently heard of the right to repair
the idea that as a okay it's going talk
what John
do I guess we can leave this you should
be able to freely repair your own device
rather than having to send it back to
the manufacturer who are basically
guaranteed to charge you more than it
costs looking at E phone companies but
quite possibly the worst offender is the
huge Farm tech company John Deere who
started integrating engine control units
into into their equipment that once they
detect any problem at all just shut down
many of the engines functions requiring
specific software and tools to fix and
where do you get those software and
tools oh you go to John Deere Ah that's
kind of smart in a bad sort of way for
John Deere now it makes sense this
company was literally designing their
products to make them purposefully
difficult to repair while also refusing
to provide Farmers or independent repair
shops with the tools needed to do so
which stings even more than the whole
right to repair drama with I turns
because let's be honest practically no
normal individual user is actually
repairing their own phone whereas in the
case of farmers and their tractors it's
a very normal thing to fix it yourself
oh and your livelihood depends on it
you're going to miss your entire Harvest
waiting for John Deere to have to fix it
and that's not even accounting for the
enormous Bill you're going to get
because of it so thankfully the company
is currently facing two class action
lawsuits accusing them of monopolizing
the industry and given that their repair
business makes them three to six times
the track insurance
other tractors out there I mean appear
in the profit that they make on actually
selling their gear it's looking less
like John
Deere more like OD
dear can you imagine how stressful it's
been having to research this
video in your you don't want to be a
regular on on a p fa decisions fly
barely
into wasn't good
still with around which both exact same
Boeing CEO to have to admit to a lapse
in quality control which you could argue
is not evil cons suing them leading this
to be our first six out of 10 bill I me
he literally ranked a door coming off a
plane six out of
10 and a fake video game five out of 10
dang I heard of bit connect there's a
good chance you saw or I've never seen
this until today likely heard this
Unstoppable [ __ ] in 2016 when the new
cryptocurrency bitconnect first
[Applause]
launched here's some advice that I think
some people could have done with at the
time if someone is literally having to
yell at you about how good their virtual
coin is don't buy it bitn if you take
what they say at face value bitconnect
seems crazy profitable users were being
promised a 1% return on their investment
every single day which if you do the
math means that if you dropped so much
as $1,000 on day one then with it
compounding every single day by the end
of 3 years you would be on $50
million the guy was basically promising
people free money and the crazy part of
it was that it kind of worked while the
value of one bit connect started out at
$0.1 the sheer fever these guys managed
to create around this coin it rocketed
the value all the way to a peak of
455 I mean that's just put a dollar in
get 455 out it's sell right do and then
the authorities got involved this was
one of the first of what would become
many crypto Ponzi schemes basically a
scam where someone asks for an
investment from you and then asks you to
go and recruit even more investors you
get paid but you're only getting paid
because even more people are being lured
into the Trap from the bottom of the
pyramids and investing their money too
and the problem with this is eventually
the pyramid has to collapse cuz you
can't keep finding bigger and bigger
groups of new investors to support the
grow weight from above so yes bitconnect
was eventually forced to refund every
single one of its investors and over $50
million in crypto well see technically
they made $50 million is they just have
to give it backed from one of its
Founders ouch seven out of 10 but we're
not always so lucky sometimes tech
companies do something truly awful and
they get away with it so just before
number
five here's a quick fire around with the
ones that got away with the iPhone 14
launch Apple really pushed the
boundaries when they it's not that bad
CS go Lotto was a website where people
could gamble with real money
sudden with the owners other influences
up to
$25,000 each to promote the site but
what happened when they got sued for
promoting well gambling for children
well they literally got away with being
told don't do that again Amazon is
widely regarded as being the worst big
tech company for how it treats its staff
in terms of stress
kind of debatable since they have like
thousands millions I don't know staff
all around the world so there's
antidotes of good news antidotes of bad
news but bad news makes headlines
because
like I mean who's ever heard of GNN Good
News Network it's encouraging delivery
drivers to make it's a thing but like no
one no one really about it it is a SK on
Alex 150 plus stops in a single day
often causing them to skip meals and
even bathroom breaks in terms of safety
with ambulances having been called out
over a thousand times since 2018 in just
the nearly
but oh just from Amazon warehouse stuff
and in terms of just general ethics with
up to 18,000 workers recently fired in
one go most found out via an email but
up until this point it hasn't caught up
with them in any meaningful way and then
while every taxation system around the
world charges you more the more money
you earn the big six tech companies
Amazon alphabet Facebook Netflix apple
and Microsoft kind of weird that he put
Netflix up there I mean look at this you
got
Microsoft um most used um computer
operating system uh like desktop
laptop largest ecommer platform search
Ai and Cloud over here larger social
network right um uh largest phone brand
for like a minute and then Samsung's
gonna take it back it like video
streaming service like these people make
YouTube you can get anything you want
from them they control like the desktop
computer Market um they also have some
of the desktop computer market right LS
which shouldn't just be meta but
whatever and then just like some random
video streaming platform have each like
I mean at this point you might as well
just put Disney up there individually
managed to sneak their way out of it by
situating their headquarters in low tax
CS I mean that's
smart that's that's just smart business
like if my headquarters are going to be
in say I don't know Texas instead of
California
and and you'll get more taxes but then
you pay less on taxes but then you like
do most of work in California that's a
smart
business even though those aren't the
zones they're primarily operating in
they've manag to get away with well I
mean to be fair alphabet Microsoft Apple
and maybe Netflix operate globally so
like I
mean since they work globally
would they get taxed everywhere so it
doesn't matter paying just $219 billion
do in taxes between 2010 and 2020 that
is a lot of money now that might sound
like a lot these are the richest
companies in the world yes and they got
that way we're making good business
practices and that accounts for just
3.6% of their total revenue that is a
lot of money like
3.6% of your Revenue that is almost 4%
reference people earning high amounts
here in the UK pay
45% I mean that kind of sounds like a UK
problem not a US problem right it
doesn't sound like a tech problem that
sounds like a UK problem like they're
headquarters or in the United
States right
so and technically they do more business
in the world than they do in the United
States
but like why would they move to to the
UK or Saudi Arabia or Mexico like they
found it
there okay if you're enjoying this video
then a sub to the channel would be
Wicked right no more companies getting
away now it's time for the top five
companies who are truly evil and who got
punished just as badly for it starting
with Wei work the company who
practically invented it wasn't evil from
what I saw it just was stupidity concept
of buying out Office Buildings and then
renting out individual floors and spaces
to businesses and inspiring
entrepreneurs and wew generated a lot of
buzz it was wonder how they afforded the
buildings great for networking it was
great for motivating people who would
otherwise be sat in their parents'
basements it gave business people a more
typical working life structure which as
someone who works some pretty odd hours
I can see the benefit of as could a lot
of people CU in fact at its peak we work
was valued at an absolutely eyeing hard
to even think about 48 billion but
nobody is immune to this series and
practically the sole reason we work
failed is their extremely irresponsible
CEO Adam Newman this guy had something
so good on his hands but he just kept
making unbelievably Reckless decisions
like buying a $60 million private jet
before the company had even gone public
investing heavily into a company that
makes artificial wave pools or I wonder
why like at least invest in something
cool like nfts or AI maybe NF but like
when Newman changed the company's name
from we work to we company which is a
name he just so happened to have
recently trademarked himself so that he
could sell that name to the company
making that's weird 59 million in
personal profits okay that's kind of
evily smart but but the final nail in
the coffin came when wework eventually
decided to go public now when a company
goes public and everyone starts buying
shares most CEOs they tend to wait for
this moment before selling their own
shares to maximize the value Newman for
some reason decided to take out his
entire $700 million in stock basically
the night before meaning that at the
point where we work actually became
available to buy there now public stats
just showed enormous losses which does
not work Newman's that's weird this just
continued poor leadership it got this
company to a stage where they were so
poor they couldn't even afford to fire
their employees leading to him asked to
resign a CEO we workor is still around
but it hasn't got even close to their
dizzying original valuation since but
from no goals than just trying to make a
quick B like for inst trying to solve
world
hunger like when scientists at mit's
media lab developed what they were
calling the food computer basically a
pod designed to grow perfect crops with
LEDs sensors pumps and precision machine
learning algorithms constantly tweaking
the internal climate the idea was to
sell thousands of these things to
Farmers to create massive agricultural
servers which would allow anyone to grow
anything and absolutely revolutionized
farming as we know it they even
announced that they already started
sending units to a refugee camp which
could really help people except they
hadn't it turned out okay let's say
let's say it was true
um where you going to get the internet
in the power to help people at the
refugee camp and also like this is a
highly powerful computer right
algorithms AI internet right lights
uh what if hypothetically speaking you
got I don't know taken a part
in like busted up and then sold for a
profit the Project Lead Caleb Harper was
just straight up lying about that for
publicity and it turned out that wasn't
the only thing he was lying about
because in 2020 it came to light that
the food computer itself didn't even
work in the first place this guy had
gone as far as to get his team to go out
and buy potted plants from a store plant
them in the computers and pass them off
as specimens that have been grown from
scratch from inside the devices MIT
obviously fired Harper and shutter the
project immediately but it just gets
worse because it turns out that the
project had also been polluting the
local water supply with toxic nitrogen
infused Wastewater the whole time so MIT
were fined too but I can't think of a
it's not even mit's F more continuous
laps in judgment than what happened
recently with Reddit on April 18th 2023
Reddit announced changes to their data
policies so they could monetize their
data better essentially before this
happened a lot of tools will be able to
freely access reddits data which means
moderators who look after the various
communities could create tools that help
them to actively approve and reject
posts as they come in that a lot of
users were free to use third party tools
to browse Reddit in a more organized
efficient way and also that Reddit had
become like the perfect place to train
new AI models cuz it's just 18 years of
pure human conversation so if you ever
wanted to build an AI that talks like us
and thinks like us then it's a gold mine
and this Arrangement worked out quite
well almost all these moderators were
basically doing reddit's work for them
for free Reddit was earning healthy
amounts of cash via the ad revenue from
the site and the platform was also just
doing a general service for the internet
but Reddit didn't like that they decided
that they wanted to start charging for
the use of their data partly to
obviously make more money immediately
but partly because they knew this would
also allow them to charge the third
party Reddit clients like Apollo which
since they have to access Reddit data to
work bucket loads of cash like in the
case of Apollo these charges would
literally have cost the app $20 million
per year in day to to charges so they
were for poor guy poor guy shut down
remember this isn't just a normal
company deciding to up the prices of
their products this is a company that's
almost built by the people who saw their
work as a form of Charity as a way to
help share information that they felt
like makes the world world a better
place and so when redditors caught wind
of what had happened they were outraged
it became Global News and I mean
redditors are always mad about something
many moderators of the subreddits they
started to go dark in protest either
that's annoying by privating those
subreddits or activating the not safe
for work tag so their content can no
longer be monetized by Reddit at the
beginning of the protest over 7,000
subredits went dark with some going
indefinitely Reddit then tried to calm
things down by offering and ask me
anything with their CEO Steve Huffman
but his refusal to budge only enraged
users more he was constantly saying
stuff like this is like a protest in a
city that goes on for too long and that
the moderators who are unpaid volunteers
remember are like the landed gentry
meaning people who have been handed
undeserved power without having had to
earn it themselves essentially this
company once the social platform with
the biggest active community in the
world continue to shoot themselves in
the foot like this until they reput okay
maybe it's stupid but it's not evil was
tarnished basically forever they're good
Corporation reputation has always been
tarnished will shredd it which matters
more so for Reddit than anyone not to
mention the large hit to General
engagement on the platform atus hfil now
it is hard to screw up more than that
but I think Volkswagen takes it after
what they did in 2015 no no no the
Volkswagen and they said they're
changing them the Volkswagen but they
said it was X not an April Fool stroke
and then they said it is an ail fool
stroke that was a screw up oh my
goodness it turns out that this company
had been fitting their cars with engines
deliberately programmed to activate
their emissions controls only when they
detect that they're in a Laboratory test
which basically meant that Volkswagen
cars were programmed to have two modes
one that meant they were actually
terrible to drive with low power and
mileage which would allow them to pass
the Environmental Protection tests and
then the other mode that the drivers
experienced which drove fine but was
secretly pumping out up to 40 times the
federal limit of some pollutants it's
kind of funny I mean that's just it's
just kind of smart honestly it's found
out that they've been doing this since
2009 with 11 million cars across the
globe being fitted with the test
cheating technology this company
rightfully got absolutely hammered
facing eye-watering fines of $25 billion
if that's not a 9 out of 10 fail I don't
know what it is but quite possibly the
biggest riches to ragil that we've ever
covered in any one of these videos is
FTX so this is s bankman fre in 2019
founded the company FTX what became the
second largest crypto exchange a
platform like binance where people could
buy and sell their cryptocurrencies and
people were all in on it a combination
of heft they had a Stadium named after
them had a Super Bowl head marketing
budgets the promise of extreme returns
and overnight riches and celebrity
endorsements and big sponsorship deals
like literally the Mercedes-Benz Formula
1 team and even the Miami Heat NBA team
whose entire stadium was was actually
rebranded to the FTX Arena I mean these
guys even had a Super Bowl ad with
legendary comedian Larry David creator
of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm and
bankman freed was being hailed as God's
gift to the world of crypto so how on
Earth do you screw up from there well
FTX was actually a mess what seemed on
the outside like the future of investing
was on the inside just problem after
problem stacked on top of each other the
first being that they weren't being
completely honest it turns out that as
well as f X bankman freed also owned
another crypto trading firm called
alamida research he said that both
companies operated completely separately
but it turned out that he was secretly
sending customer deposits from FTX so
money that people are traded in to Alam
research to then invest in Risky things
to try and turn it into even more money
gambling with customer funds between
companies without telling them is
spectacularly illegal o That's
especially since we're not talking like
thousands of dollars or even Millions
this was done with with $1 billion and
there was an even more fundamental
problem see the way that a crypto
exchange should work is to constantly
make sure that it has liquid assets lots
of money to make sure that if any
customer decides they want out that they
want to swap their crypto back into
dollar say that the exchange can give it
to them FTX did not have that the money
that bankman fre told people he had was
actually almost completely just other
cryptocurrencies which already makes
them unstable should anything happen to
the crypto Market but most worryingly
their largest asset was their own
cryptocurrency called ftt let me just
get this straight so Sam made a currency
he assigned a value to that currency and
then he used that value as the
collateral to finance his projects and
gain Investments and what that so he
just printed money essentially meant was
that the ability of FTX as a platform to
actually pay anybody was completely
dependent on the current market value of
ftt which is fine when it's doing well
but then when ftt be depended on the
market value of FTX so if FTX goes up
then the money inside the system goes up
but if you withdraw money from the
system then the money that you've
withdrawn goes down soon as the tides
started to turn against crypto which
coincided with one of ftxs competing
platforms deciding to get rid of every
bit of ftt that they had in one Fell
Swoop the market was suddenly flooded
with ftt that no one wanted and its
value collapsed FTX immediately lost a
large chunk of the value that they had
then it gets worse because as soon as a
ton of TT is sold customers start to
lose confidence in FTX too and so at the
same time that FTX loses its money it
has to give its money leading to a
massive implosion bankruptcy of the
company and S bankman freed facing up to
115 years in prison that's a 10 thanks
for watching it really does mean a lot
to me I'll catch you in the next
one D hey got to
say I to see any chat no okay
what else do we have to talk about um oh
yes I have an udy course on
my oh no I left my charger I have an UD
course on my
phone okay let me see I need to find a
USBC
cable
I have an UD Quest on my phone right and
it tells me that with bettery cap I can
downgrade to
HT s i me https HTTP with my Wi-Fi
antenna so let's see if we can do a
thech boy hacking
a think so because it's an UD name
equest I probably can't show it on
YouTube but I'll just go step by step on
here so I'm using Zade Securities which
I got for $12 few years ago and I
finally got my antenna so I can finally
uh finish the
course here you
go okay I'll just open it on my
phone
and speaking of phone we got to talk
about uh the new Google Assistant thing
maybe I'll do a comparison between it
and co-pilot okay let's see hey
Google hey
Google
open un
me open
udy
so it can do commands but unfortunately
it doesn't do stuff like it has like the
man's voice and you can't change it and
it's also slower than regular Google
Assistant I didn't open okay so wa right
so
um I need to what my login
is
okay so here has a what it call packet
caplet in here that will help you bypass
uh
https with battle cap on your Ki Linux
thing so I guess got to download the CET
you might
think okay let's see it's lecture
11 maybe it's
12 it
is
okay so I'm going to go log
in and okay we
go and while I'm logging in we can talk
about
um
uh uh uh yeah yeah co-pilot versus gem
so Gemini works on your
phone and copil also works on your
phone right um co-pilot and Gemini both
uh support
image image like you can search by
images under I want to see if Gemini can
generate images let's see
here generate an image of a Flying
Pig um but co-pilot I think is less
restricted than Gemini like less
structured and I think they're both the
same
speed um yes they go both can generate
images so here's my Flying Pig
image
um
Gemini you can share photos with it it
voices yeah you can also take photos
like if I take a photo and ask it what
something is it will do it for
you so that's
nice um
Gemini
so yeah it's Gemini and co-pilot I have
both of them on my
phone and now I can log into my
UD so here we
go but coite it does win one round
because it's also on
PC okay so now I'm gonna have to log in
to my
thing all right I'm in let have to go
into my learning
and I cannot show it on screen for
copyright reasons probably
but
but
um I forgot what I'm saying oh I need to
log back in as a student and not as an
instructor here we
go so I have the USBC adapter here so I
I could plug this right directly into my
USBC Port right
here
boom I'm in I got my antenna here and it
will automatically connect to my C Linux
virtual
machine so I'll start my lesson and then
I'll share my screen so here we go so
here's
calling I got to reconnect because it's
asking me if I wanted to
connect okay there we go it's connected
now I have to make sure it shows on
screen there we
go oh got wrong I
think okay now what you do is you go
into caring I'm going to follow the
instructions on
screen bypassing HTT
GPS so what you have to do is you go and
you will
type and of course you have to be
connected to the network for this to
work
um okay here we go I'm playing the
video
so I have to go to home and then
desktop oh I'm sorry
files
and then I have
to go
home oh okay I'm at
home and then
what spoof that c okay so what I'm going
to do is going to go here and I'm going
to look for spoof do
cap
maybe it's not downloaded so now I have
to find the Z security
thing okay I'm gonna
no okay here you
go I'm trying to use this like my
Android oh no
okay
oh you have to make your own sp sp
spoofing
script okay I guess we can do this later
um so yeah that's all for now God bless
and talk to you later</pre>
