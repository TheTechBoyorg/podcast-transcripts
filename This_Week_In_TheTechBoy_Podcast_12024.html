<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
podcast hello hello and welcome to the
This Week in Tech boy
podcast um where's the intro music come
on come
[Music]
on hello and welcome to the tech boy
This Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast Hello everybody welcome to this
weekend the tech boy podcast we have
plenty plenty to talk about today and
lots to get into the Apple Vision Pro is
coming out soon Galaxy s24 Ultra
um I want it a lot and uh maybe I'll
find a way to get it soon when it's new
and not 5 years old uh and there's also
plenty of other phones that we could be
investing in including the mod roller
Edge phone series of devices all right
so let's let's just start into the s24
ultra okay so we soar screen
here Galaxy s24
Ultra okay Galaxy s24 Ultra pretty good
specs on the phone right unfortunately
it does lose um it does lose the 10
times Periscope zoom camera but it does
bring an upgraded AI Zoom which is
slightly worse but the 5 megapixel zoom
camera in there is higher megapixels so
that's good it's 50 megapixels instead
of 10 so these are the specifications of
the device fortunately it doesn't look
like it has a Micro SD card slot so all
of them are running Galaxy Ai and Galaxy
AI has some very interesting features so
here we go Galaxy s24 Ultra all right we
got a 5,000 milliamp battery wir is
Power share of course a terabyte of
storage on here 12 gigs of RAM um and
then it has a Snapdragon 8 gen mobile
platform for Galaxy and we'll get into
that chip and then we have 12 gigs of
RAM the integrated s pin 5 gigb uh sorry
5G and a 200 megapixel camera right all
normal stuff like that now when you get
into the AI
stuff one of the important things that
they have done is according to Mr host
boss they have improved the camera
response speed for about 100
milliseconds which is good now on my
phone here um it takes a long time to
take a picture but what it also does to
take a long time is is when I'm in photo
mode and I go click video one 1,002 one
it it takes such a long time it's
actually working better now oh nope nope
it lags whenever I like change it so
let's see if you can see it on the
camera I'll make this big for
you okay notice how when I click
photo look listen to that lag and that
may that lag may not um seem significant
but as you guys um know um I film uh
sports for my school sometimes so if I
want to go from my camera shot zoom in
zoom in zoom in and I want to go back to
video to get a video so I can clip it
into the videos for the school um I it
it it's really slow and in sports it's
not like you can say oh could you uh
stand up there and redo that play it
doesn't make sense doesn't work like
that anyway Galaxy AI all right so we
have Circle to search which is a really
interesting feature it's basically like
taking a screenshot crapping it and
searching into Google just faster all
right you have live translate which uh
seems to be iffy but I mean it
translates over the phone which is good
um note assistance which sounds good and
generative edit which is okay I guess
but I mean it's nothing phenomenal
especially since it needs an internet
connection also with the wallpapers
which need internet connection as well
unfortunately you cannot download them
apparently but of course you can always
like go make a new app screen make sure
there no apps on it then take a
screenshot then edit out the add
Watermark your ways around it I
mean
yeah unfortunately we didn't get an
offline chat bot like I expected though
I would like to see if Leila AI Lea AI
being the offline chatbot application
that we tested uh on the website a few
weeks ago if Lea AI would work on this
phone faster um and if it worked fast
because of the CPU and extra Ram four
gigs of extra Ram um so I can enable
like the better mode and en force a more
powerful chip or if it would could
utilize AI cor cores of the device as
well so that'll be a very interesting uh
thing
to
also it does have 120 frames per second
which we talked about
uh I think we did let me pull it up
here ah here it is it comes with 4K 120
frames per second I think and here's we
did a review of this oh wow about this
time last year January 2nd 2023 so 4K
120 um is important
because it means you can slow the videos
uh down uh faster like in AB like L
Fusion you can slow it down have better
slow motion essentially now you may say
that's that but on this phone here you
can record in 4k 120 FPS right and then
you can use AI just hold down on the
video and we'll have the video using
frame interpretation technology which
means the video will go slower right and
then it's also going to have at a
simulated AI 240 frames per second video
instead of having to do it by say two
time no four times on 60 FPS you can
only do it on two times 120 FPS which
makes it you know better and more
smooth all right so here you go galaxy
AI um they also has AI in the typing
applications which we've seen some of
this before from Microsoft swift key
keyboard so I I don't know which one's
going to be better or worse oh I just
remembered I got this Amazon gift card
here and we have ordered a good wi-fi
hacking Anna on here that's actually
going to work with card venx none that
stupid driver stuff will be coming on
Monday because I did not want to pay for
the extra shipping so check that out and
this is going to lead into a very
important segment uh
soon
all right so we have you know better
photos and videos they've been working
on that since like 20 2018 and then AI
touching suggestion right
there all right let's check out these
accessories that they have here because
they had some very interesting
accessories I think so they have these
smart cases which kind of dumb I guess
cuz there's cases that sink with your
phone to get the wallpaper which then
like I'm pretty sure you can just find
the wallpaper online for free but that's
neither here no D then you have this
really interesting case here so it's a
stand and it's also a grip I actually
like it now I don't know what it's made
out of it looks like it's rubberized
rubberized yeah see if have any comments
here hello Robert we're talking about
the s24 ultra
here uh and of course the Galaxy smart
tag 2 which my review of this will be
coming out but I hear that a new new
application oneui 6.1 is going to
replace the smart fine application so I
will wait until there but I can just
give a synopsis of this here right it's
good for tracking things over long
distances like I got left in someone's
car accidentally and I was able to see
where they were and the locations were
able to match up correctly but in short
distances like say uh HB like really big
HB it sometimes disconnected and the
information is kind of weird because I
don't know which way on my phone is up
like is this up if it's telling me to go
right go left it's kind of like you're
just wandering around the store uh
trying to find the person I did find him
so uh oh yeah we can talk about the
OnePlus open yeah OnePlus open um
unfortunately here we don't have it here
in studio but for my analysis it looks
like a really powerful pre AI Revolution
phone so it's running a really powerful
chip it can run three applications like
at the same time on the same screen has
a really really good camera I've heard
so it's just like you know this is like
the super Powerhouse of the affordable
phones and I really hope that Samsung
gets there now now I will say that
Samsung software is probably more po
well no the affordable software on the
OnePlus open it's probably more polished
but just Samsung in general
is probably more polished but I mean
like say there's like actual deck it's
like the random Android desktop mode but
the screens are probably better there
the cameras are definitely better there
and the productivity factor is better
there and they also can go uh no
actually an iPad Pro iPhone an IP Ad Pro
and an iPhone 15 Pro would not be
cheaper iPhone 15 Pro be
uh 999 1, something USD I don't know how
many that would be in British dollars
and then um an iPad Pro depending on
which version you
get could be expensive I mean depends on
which version of iPad Pro you get
because I mean honestly the one for open
is like only
$1,600 um in this context only still a
lot of money but I mean
iPhone 15 Pro means you are stuck with
iOS so that's a downgrade there and then
of course you stuck with iPad OS I mean
iPhone 15 Pro you can't even you can't
even split screen on that and iPad Pro I
mean you have to sync everything
though well when you converted all the
time it was didn't work like that it
yeah but iPhone 15 Pro and iPad Pro I
mean sure that technically makes sense
but once you get everything going like
you get the keyboard and everything you
have basically a whole laptop at that
point and it they can't even do laptop
like things and you have to carry two
devices with you at the same time so if
i' rather to have a OnePlus open and an
iPad Pro and iPhone 15 Pro my opinion I
mean the cameras are better besides you
can do so much more with the cameras on
there you can use as a stand tripod you
can show people's stuff you can hinge it
up you can get all your text and stuff
on there and technically you could get
all your text on your iPad as well but I
Thinking by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and
stuff
all
pixel fold is dropped well yeah but the
pixel fold is kind of like a test
project I mean the bezels on that thing
yeah they're better to hold the St
device but they look like a folding
phone from 2019 the cameras are good
though and unfortunately they don't have
Google's cloud-based AI features on it
like generative edit which I mean you
can probably put generative edit on a
pretty powerful calculator because it's
just like a cloud function all right
back to the s204 ult accessories here of
course S4 does have deck so that's good
wonder what kind of AI featur I've
always lik these cases here but the
problem with these cases is if you want
to take a picture like Fallout cases you
have to fold them out so basically
holding like a whole tablet up there or
you flip it back around unless you can
flip it back and then just opens up
space for the cameras and then a vegan
lther case but okay and then sealed case
and a reflecting screen
protector oh it's not a privacy screen
protector and then of course you can buy
another s pin to replace
it let's
see let's see how much this one plus
open
cost
$1,700
but oh 16 gigs of RAM let me see
here
the OnePlus 12 also came out soon has 24
gigs of RAM which means it can
run yeah I saw that but they'll probably
get some backlash and then the with off
and some of the features probably won't
cost money that's my opinion like I say
the notes feature but maybe the text to
speech feature might cost money like
translating
because
yeah
all right um let's see what's on YouTube
here and speaking of we I forgot to talk
about this last time but we got our SDR
here let me make this big we go we got a
SDR here ex extends extends and this
will lead us Ching us right into our
headlines we're going to be talking
about techboy theor
best tech website on the planet here all
right techboy one very very popular
article here um you know our Niche is
now becoming the Spy Tech uh stuff so
you know follow the niche and we have
dethroned the Samsung Galaxy M8 M7
article the pixels article and we got to
talk about this new Google competitor
called free spoke you
know all right so RL SD so that's SD I
have here it has the SDR thingy like the
actual chip USB thing at the end of it
here just looks like a flash drive and
then it has antennas there so you can
intercept the radio signals so all you
have to do is you plug this in to your
computer know via USB and then you
follow the instructions right that we
have laid out on
here and you'll see this so this is
basically my walkie-talkie Channel range
462 is 460 and what you have to do is
you tap it into there and on your phone
you also use this application you type
in your frequency so around the 460
range if you don't know your frequency
what you do is you go online you look it
up on the FTC website or you know most
walkie-talkies in this real probably
around a 400 something frequency so you
can just go into the software you know
scan around till you see a spike you tap
onto it and you change the settings a
little bit so you can get the best uh
hearings you got to do a little playing
around and next article will teach you
how you can record this audio for uh
purposes either if if you're the
opposing team you need to know what your
agency is communicating all right uh
good
morning and go to church I guess today
uh or if you need this for regulatory
because if you're Constitution say you
need to tape your walkie-talkie comes
time know I don't make the rules I just
right do a call all right I really want
an s24 ultra we'll get into that one too
and then we'll talk about free spoke
free spoke is this uh new search engine
new type search engine that uh
um you know tries to go up against
Google and kind of fails I mean it's
writing the AI Trend it's running
writing the AI Trend right and it's
premium search engine that has a
article summarizing summarizes search
results from like new searches as left
right or Center in a political uh sense
of the word and also has video search
and thankfully it doesn't go he Rumble
Rumble was the best video platform on
the face of the planet uh rumble's UI is
trash and it's atrocious sorry for all
the people who are listening on Rumble
right now uh we just think over there um
it it allows you to filter now this is a
feature that Google should probably take
it allows you to filter by YouTube
Rumble Tik Tok Vimeo and Facebook now I
mean granted
it's audience I'm not sure why they even
let you filter VI via Tik Tok but I mean
not one 17-year-old okay other than me
is using free spoke uh internet I'll
just tell you that uh SE shs um but the
SE Engine results are badly badly uh
laid out and I don't even know what sear
engine is using like most of these for
lack of better with knockoff search
engines use Bing as their basis like uh
what's it called kosia uh Duck Duck Go
um I don't know if Brave uses it but
mostly like oh yaho uses Bing as a
search engine right but free spoke I
think they built their own engine and uh
you can see that because uh it's it's
awful I mean it does have interesting
features like I built AI into it and it
does have it little
like homepage here so you can see news
articles so it's kind of like
Edge World Cup's going to be at uh FIFA
I mean
Arlington but I'm going to see if we if
we search something
Samsung and I do like that it has tabs
up
here what the heck does Samsung have to
do with
Ukraine
what and that's kind of random I tyed in
Samsung and it's telling me to get the
full perspective on Ukraine I thought
they were saying Samsung was made on
Ukraine I some random random article
here and then uh you got your quick
match here so it finds the best search
results so that's good and then you got
your news article too that's good and
then you got your AI sum
here and then you can filter by left
right or Center so if I click right
here what's nine news never heard of
them right
middle Digital Trends left CBS News I
mean
well we did have canceled the votage and
we still have that we got to uh 27 same
thing that happened to your Eagles be
quiet go go just whatever all right
um then you got your
Samsung
uh what what is this called news news uh
locations you places near
us and then you got like terrible switch
like Samsung appliances that's not what
we looked for Samsung Newsroom Samsung
like these search results are like
really old like this is what we expect
from 200
2005 uh and then you keep find all these
Samsung X accounts and then you got that
at the bottom which I don't even know
know how they make money like 30% of
nothing is still nothing um and then you
got video oh maybe it's this thing here
of course it doesn't have the advanced
features and by Advanced features I mean
featur search engine for the head since
like 201 and5 like you know image shirs
like lens and then
uh because it's a what do they call it
it's like those it's an ALT Tech search
engine so it's it's trying to give you
like the news on something whenever you
search something like the
homepage
uh is this and
then uh wait what was I search Samsung
that's always my test search on any
search engine and then they always give
you like the perspective on something
c yeah it's like one of
the it's like one of those like uh an
suppression of media soci Eng something
like that uh and then you got their
Wikipedia page which I mean
does just can Sur pedia even have a look
article on Samsung let me see
like let me see let's see
here oh they do it's just really
uh okay so back
to what's it called well yeah but I mean
it has nothing to do with Samsung
Samsung's way over in South
Korea which is technically at War but
they
don't that's kind of ir relevant and
then they have the yeah so this like
nothing good of a s doesn't have the
advanced features that you do but I do
like that it still has these tabs here
kind of news articles have on
Samsung yeah I mean found something in
Spanish like this is this is English and
it knows I'm in Houston which I guess
since Houston has like 30 different
languages might find me an article in
Vietnamese Chinese English but I'm
searching in
English it's just not that good of a
search engine and then for videos I do
like this filter here where you can
filter by YouTube which is number one so
I'm glad that they put it there and then
put Rumble and then Vimeo and then like
no one knows uses Vimeo I mean if I
designed this it probably be YouTube
Facebook Tik Tok Rumble Vimeo in that
order and then shopping of
course okay
um now we got to talk about adventures
and odyssey so for those of you who
don't know Ventures and
odyssey well
true for those of you who don't know
Advent Odyssey which pretty let see a
freb know
is I V Odyssey just wrapped up some oh
it does there we go wait vinc has a
YouTube channel I need to subscribe let
me copy there we
go for those you don't know Vin is an
Evangelical Christian radio drama and
comedy series
for Wikipedia um they're playing The
ryel Saga over on khcb a local christian
uh n uh Channel like uh radio channel uh
radio network here in Houston Texas and
they're playing The ryel Saga which if
you those of you who don't know the ryel
Saga is this Saga about this kid named
Mo ryel started in 2016 still going on
to 2018 which is kind of weird 2024 it's
been going on for eight years which
means it's been going on since I was 9
years old eight years old depending on
when they started doing it and they had
all these detective
article maybe I think they started when
I was 10 yeah when I was 10 uh they've
been doing like these detective lucku
stuff here um he's really good with
computers and I just realized today that
I am slightly like him now
um in some ways I mean he did almost
cause World War um three between Canada
and China um by creating diplomatic
issues in Japan with him that's a Whole
sag I've R out a time and he is a master
like manipulator St criminal like he
examine people's stuff by opening their
lockers as in one of the episodes really
interesting like it's always given me uh
experience that I've always wanted to um
have
uh uh like being good school detective
and everything like that um but it's
exper I figured out that I'm kind of
like him like he's good with computers
I'm good with computers as you can you
know see by the channel you know
existing um and then there's
the the uh in today's episode which they
played on KTB I heard this clip of him
walking up behind someone and uh he
scared him and for those of you who
probably aren't watching this channel um
I've done that to you multiple times
because I know
walk quietly apparently and uh
or maybe you have
airpod hurt in your ears I'm listening
to airpods
um yeah um and then there's
also like he's good with computers he
can walk up behind people um and even
though he said he's not that good of a
detective his sister is good at being a
detective and I'm good at being a
detective so there's that and he
probably uses an Android phone he does
use a Mac because we heard that from the
startup sound in one of his episodes oh
he's also good at cyber security I don't
use a map though
um and speaking of
Google speaking of
Google um we got to talk about let me
see where it
is so this guy here from the Bon B he
uses Google which oh he also uses an
Android phone as you can see he's using
Chrome I think this is probably the
Android version of Chrome let me
see I don't know well at least he uses
uh he uses Chrome right and and
which I was oh you can't even see which
I was I was I was glad because like Dr
go was trash and we proved that twice on
this channel we have proven that Dr go
is garbage and then I
said why why is someone respond
responded like I said said why are you
still using Google and I said because
it's better than free spoke or duct that
go and someone said I like Brave and I
said it's still better than Google so
we're going to see see if this is true
um you know I'm Pro Google has been made
where
of uh since 2021 this fave search engine
looks
like if they're paying you to use their
search engine it's really good search
engine like if Google paid me to use the
search Eng I use it all the time I mean
you.com yes Google is great and though
they may have views that aren't entirely
Christian until someone else comes up
with the half is better algorithm
um I'm not going to degrade my search
experience um because of uh and you
start using free spoke a duck. go or
like acosia which I guess is guess see
use on test too
Samsung the design is very
old wait what happened to our Wikipedia
page it's
weird I do like the bubble design we got
some videos here from you
oops from YouTube which is good glad
they're not pulling videos from like
Rumble
um then but then it kind of goes down
the
train like you're putting search results
from Samsung Ireland Samsung
Australia
and another Australian thing and uh it's
localized Houston Texas and I can assure
you Houston Texas is nowhere near
Ireland it's nowhere near
Australia at all what's
goggles why do it withy sear Eng you can
find right
left okay you see what this means like
is this a new is this a new
feature Newsmax says Tech I never knew
that is this a new feature built into
search engines you can just filter by
right wing and left wing it's kind of
interesting why would I use Brave
if it's kind of a weird uh feature for
your Swit engine to have let me see
come on okay it's loading it's not as
bad as some like d goes I guess and they
do pay you to use it
so let's see what we have here post you
say that that's terrible why are you
talking about some random Walmart deal I
mean what we want to know is about that
I mean if they get this right get mid
does kind of suck um it's piece of
garbage of
what
else
yeah happy Hug Day that's nice okay
um hey Haley's Haley's World from what
country is that South Africa upload a
new video um so she talk about the AI
Tools in new Samsung phones I like the
LI logo paid yeah get paid in Bitcoin or
cryp some type of
cryptocurrency um and you can either
donate them to creators or you
can uh keep them for yourself and
exchange
[Music]
them I found the best new AI tools of
the year like AI that generates as you
draw AI that makes any image come to
life and all right let's see if we can
use these tools here because I've seen
both of those here you go and even AI
that turn your voice into a musical
instrument it's mind-blowing what you
can do with all this new AI so let oh he
got a new studio too I mean look at that
TV and accent lights I mean it's kind of
nice but it's kind of I don't know like
too much stuff going on back there let
me blow your mind
okay so straight up the bats you can use
these AI tools on a phone a computer or
even a
tablet no yay
no so just pick one and for the first AI
tool head on over to
leonard. Once inside the website it's
super easy to start using just by
tapping on launch app and on the left
hand side they have this new realtime
canvas tool oh let's see if this works
okay
see basically how it works is the Box on
the left is a canvas where you can draw
what you'd like the AI to generate and
don't worry your artwor can be pretty
bad but here's where it gets mindblowing
because now I can type in what I'd like
to see and as I type the well that's
good animation from her editor AI will
generate the artwork straight away which
is crazy then you can even pick the
exact art style you'd like it in whether
that's cinematic photographic fantas wow
I mean look at this contrast here you
have
just stick figure and you got that
whatever that is piece of
metal let's see okay I cck on app let me
see if it makes me sign in hopefully I
don't have to sign in yay I don't have
to sign
in okay what was oh I have to sign in
and they do have a mobile application
only for for iOS for some reason
Android's better okay share just tab
again art sketch uh do you want to see
what it looks like or can we move on
Dynamic art there are so many different
options to choose from then there's even
this instant refine option let's move on
to AI
paintbrush so imagine you had a
paintbrush that could magically make
pictures come alive well you can
actually do that using this AI tool
called Runway ml.com which I have
actually before but it's gotten some
cool new features so once you've logged
in using your Google account if you
select this text to video option you'll
find this brand new tool called motion
brush all you got to do is drag and drop
in any photo or picture you have or like
I got that's a really good picture this
picture of a bird then what you do is
paint over the areas you'd like to bring
to life so I wanted the entire bird to
move so I painted over the whole thing
but you could do the background instead
if you wanted now all you do is actually
adjust the motion by using these sliders
you can move them left or right up and
down and even zoom in and out but once
you're all done just click save then
click generate and in a few minutes your
photo will literally come to life which
is just so freaking cool I mean that's
interesting but what are you going to do
with that I guess maybe make animated
wallpapers and this works on pretty much
any picture just use the brush on
whatever it is you'd like to animate and
let the AI do it magic I also noticed
this works really well with elements
like fire and water it did enhance the
smoke C it made the sky darker it looks
incredible with animals and really
understands their movement plus you can
even use selfies which is just crazy to
me and almost any landscape looks
incredible so basic I guess you can make
good stack photo footage of that just go
mad and see how far you can push
it so this next app is something totally
new to the AI world it's called Hey
genen and it's been blowing people's
mind it's actually totally free to try
out and all you got to do is log in
again using your Google account then
head over to the video translate section
over here now you just got to take a
video of yourself talking it could be
around 30 seconds or if you want you can
make it even longer but then it's time
to take that video and drag and drop it
into this upload box then what you can
do is oh it's going to change your
speech it's great from this list of
languages you can choose something like
French for example and if you click on
let's do the instruments
thing uh oh what happened hello tech for
your
needs those things I have ever seen and
it's called musicfly LOL musicfly
musicly trust me the LOL must stand for
off out loud because of what you do
using this tool once you've loaded it up
click on get started and in the corner
who's ever heard of a LOL domain it
seems kind of sketchy over here just
make sure you log in using your Google
account and don't worry it's totally
free to use then once you've logged in
all you got to do is change to
instrumentals and over here select the
instrument you'd like to use like
electric guitar and then this is where
things get really funny you'll have to
press record and please don't laugh but
then you'll need to literally make a
sound like a guitar something like
this
then once you're done just click remix I
you have to sing for it instead of and
the AI will turn your voice into
something like
[Music]
this interesting I wonder if you can
convert humming to a song as
[Music]
well which sounds so cool and you can
also add some rhythm
guitar what's it called uh
uh something.
LOL let's see maybe we can test this
out you'll have to press record and
please don't laugh but then you'll need
to literally make a sound like a guitar
something like
this and don't worry it's totally you do
using this tool why you loaded music fle
okay
11
[Music]
the labs has come up with something that
is totally changing the AI voice game
just sign into it using your Google
account and again this one is free to
start using and once you're in you'll
see this brand new speech to speech
option once you've selected it you can
then pick from one of 11 lab's pre-made
voices oh
it's it's like Giovani for example we
did we did that for our what's it
called
uh uh Audio
Drama what was this called again when we
made our AI Power Audio Drama and all
you got to do is change to why is it
blowing out
everything music FY
thing that is totally and then we use
those voices to have you
know different uh sounds so we wouldn't
have to make them all right we going to
be testing a music flea a fly whatever
Ai and let's see if we can try it out
for
free then after this we're going to talk
more go more in depth on the s22 plus uh
on the s24 Ultras AI features let's
see okay let's
see okay I'm going to record audio so I
probably might have to mute for this I
don't know let's see I'm going to home
the
national wait it's making me sign in so
I'm just going to continue with
Google
and I'm just going to keep talking so
you don't think that I you
know
blanks like gave up on you
guys okay here we go I'm creating I'm
going to do an instrumental we're going
to record the audio all right let's see
all right going on
okay okay here we go going to share
screen I'll play it for you guys a
little bit let see what it sounds
[Music]
like all right you guys get to pick
instrument so oh there's no one in the
chat right now okay I'll pick a piano I
guess we go gener and it's extracting
the audio samples and as that is going
on let's go back to our
video
AI GIF says GIF swap you know I I
sometimes controversial but I'm not
going to be controversial about that
Miss gif. apppp on you're in the site as
you scroll down you'll see a list of
super popular gifts or if you don't like
any of the options you can also search
for your own one like black widow for
example which of course will bring up a
whole bunch of different options but
once you found the gift you like just
hit on the browse button under it and
here look for a photo of yourself or
better yet choose one of a friend and
once you found it tap on let's face swap
and then check this out after a few
seconds the AI will generate this
hilarious face swap GIF which let's not
lie does such a damn good job at making
it look real I I haven't even seen a
face Dr yet thing is is that all of this
is absolutely free once you've signed in
you pretty much get unlimited that's
pretty
nice okay maybe our music is ready oh
it's ready it's ready okay here we
go
[Music]
what was that maybe we should try
a a
guitar no no no I was doing electric
guitar I don't know what that was that
was a mess okay okay back to the
video Generations which is honestly kind
of perfect for sending to your friends
as a joke I guarantee if you send them a
face swap GIF of yourself you'll get a
pretty crazy
response so by now we should all know
about chat GPT and what's chat GPT how
would kick started the AI Revolution but
it's had a massive update where you can
now make your own AI with it oh yeah but
you have to pay for that
so there you
go recently in for no reason at all I
ask mint Mobile's legal team if big
wireless companies are
allow so AI clones of yourself are
definitely cool but if you head on over
to room ai.com with this tool you can
actually use AI to redecorate your
entire house all right and we'll just
leave off on that window and go to our
Mr Boss video soon and but first we have
to go back to our electric guitar
Nation
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
that's you know it's better I guess all
right now let's uh let's do M the
boss and he's going to go more in detail
on our AI Galaxy s24 Ultra
features
actually one of the most fascinating
phones of the last decade I'd actually
Peg it as the phone that's about to
reignite the entire Battle of the
smartphone that would been kind of
interesting if that circle thing uh
deleted his foot starting today I'm
going to be fully switching over to it
in place of my iPhone why well a bunch
of important hard let's get to the
point
smooth feel and the futuristic look of a
curved screen and so oh yeah they got
rid of the curved screen which is kind
of sad it's an end of an
era though I guess the curve screen was
supposed to be the transition for
folding screen and they have those now
for five years so no 2019 was a good
five years ago best in the wild uh song
from
VBS cuz like what's the competition what
does that what does that mean which is
why I specifically asked them multiple
times what's the actual difference
between this glass and the last phone's
glass yeah the glass is supposedly
stronger let's see he didn't put chap in
here so it reduces glare up to company
manages to seemingly remake a glass
every year and give it new features but
hey I'm not complaining the s24 ultra's
display does look absolutely Dr and it's
at 2,200 2,500 something like that knits
of brightness which is simply amazing
and of course it has one to 120 H
display scaling on all the phones and a
uh HD QHD display on the s24 plus which
is good S2 4 probably didn't need it
because the display so small but you'll
probably be able to appreciate the
benefit and have a on high resolution on
the cheaper phone which thank goodness
gous so these are good spec bumps to
what was already very much not broken
and I haven't even talked about the
biggest one the s24 ultra is powered by
the Snapdragon 8 gen 3 chip which is
probably the meatiest upgrade in The
Last 5 Years and oh I just saw the
Google messages icon and I was playing
with this like AI chat application I
would analyze your text and then try to
predict with the first what the person
was going to say it's terrible if it
somehow combine my text and the other
person's text and the one text and then
predicted that's what person was going
to say which is kind of weird and then
it also has is a that like
predict from
texts like what if if the person's like
your friend or something but the one
question it had preloaded the one
question and you couldn't even add
another one and it send all your text to
the cloud it's probably a virus I don't
know I don't even know what this app's
called uh let's see texting AI the one
question I had preloaded was does do do
they have a question on like the one
question it's such a dumb nothing else
my my goodness but Google messages still
can't use it because there's no message
organization just a long line of
messages you can't even organize them
you can't even customize the background
it's honestly
sad the first time in recent memory
where you can actually unambiguously say
it is more powerful than the latest
iPhone oh yeah I mean look at this 300
but no 200 point which is already big
but then Samsung uses a custom version
of that chip called the 8 gen 3 for gxy
which gives you even faster speeds than
all your normal peasant AG gen 3 friends
so there's no doubt in my mind that at
Peak Performance apps will fly it's just
that and look at this new uh Zoom I
guess that's the same thing that I have
I just don't have five and 10 times
Optical it also has 12 gigs of RAM and
OnePlus oh yeah it's called May AI which
is kind of
stupid because it has a faster technique
look at it there is so much faster and
the colors here I think they're better I
don't
know and speaking of camera and colors
and everything
um just forget the s24 ultra true camera
phone
here we go the s24 ultra uh does not
have a multi-sectorial camera but it may
have one in the next one this is able to
see true colors and smartphone fixures
here which as you can see here the
colors are B reproduced
in using the test phone then with the
fake phone oh yeah that's bad that's
good um and it's able to like take good
pictures
of pant tone uh stuff here which um will
prove that the cameras are better and
just proves that it uh could help
identify skin conditions eCommerce
and something and the this technology
can be influ within two years so expect
better color accur seeing on phones
soon and yeah I think we can talk more
about the AI features later uh that's
all for now go rest Tech
talk</pre>
