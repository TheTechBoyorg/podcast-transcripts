expectations and here's the best scene
in the movie of all
time uh should my Wi-Fi work let's

me a motion sickness I mean good grief
the the flickering but
[Music]

what what kind of outfit is
[Music]
that who okay sorry who on Earth walks
into a room and looks at a 45 degree
angle
up like how are he supposed to see where
he's supposed to walk it's no wonder
he's going to run over this PO
yeah if I saw that I'd be blinking too
like kid why are your eyes staring that
way look look look look his friend here
is also in the uh in the background
walking in slow motion so apparently
this kid has the power of slow motion
which I guess that' be a great power to
have but I guess it the side effects is
that your eyes end up getting screwed 45
degrees just still at the ceiling towels
so
[Music]
who dropped it oh yeah she dropped it no
wonder she dropped it she can't even see
where she's
going me can you direct me to the
chemistry
lab we have a chem lab yes according to
my sign up what does that music do what
of course the cam lab
I'm more of a biology man myself don't
concern myself with much of the
chemistries but you must concern
yourself the survival of the planet
depends on it he gets these like little
red flags here right but you guys see
where the scene is going right like he
has a crush on the SCAR or whatever but
then but then you you you'll see what
happens next so pretty views on climate
change not important and when we move to
a global economy we must make sure we
share all our
resources this communist alot went on
Al socialm alert socialm Al well here we
