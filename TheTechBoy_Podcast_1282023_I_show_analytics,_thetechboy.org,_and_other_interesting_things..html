<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
all right hello everybody this is the
tech boy and welcome to This Week in
Tech podcast let's see what we will do
today so let's see if we can get this
five minutes or less or not let's just
see how this goes all right so um this
is a very popular video that I just put
out today it's called the tech boy
reacts to Michael Knowles ginsey terms
we've gotten about 12 views on it since
I posted it at two o'clock
um I even got to premium some of my fans
so thank you guys for watching this so
this is just me reacting to a Michael
Knowles gen Z Tunes video there's
another Gingy video that I want to watch
by him so I will be reacting to that
later as you guys may be able to see in
that video
um I'm back on Windows 11 so now
um Windows 10 was kind of giving me some
problems the arrow keys not working uh
my backspace
um and minus keys still not working but
I mean at least my arrow keys are
working and you know I kind of like the
UI now live tiles on as good as I
thought they would be um going back also
I don't know maybe it's faster maybe
it's not I'm not sure but speaking of
Windows I'm running Windows 10 on my
phone right now or at least trying to
um so it's causing all kinds of weird
arrows on YouTube presumably because of
all the you know RAM management
Etc so
um I'm installing it on an application
called novel PC emulator and
um I'm pulling it up now it's also
actually causing YouTube to kind of like
crash when I leave the app let's see
still getting virals ready for
installation at zero percent so I'm
actually going to
[Music]
um
keep this app open which means that when
I try to close all of it uh oops no I'm
not going to split screen
um nope actually I'll just close all the
applications here and just save up the
RAM for limbo PC emulator all right I'll
get back to you on how that went also
um and up the news Samsung releases
cross device browsing um feature which
basically means that you can now start
browsing an article on your Samsung
phone and Fitness on your Samsung PC
I've actually I might actually try to
test it out because I have both and
we'll get back to you later on that this
is just a Samsung Music
um article here
um and this is a Samsung laptop Samsung
present with the s22 ultra almost
recorded the note 22. interesting right
here oh they're still using internet
all right so check talk to you oh that's
what the website was saying not Tech
talks all right guys don't forget about
the canceled the food petition um the
village is promoting some pretty bad
stuff and
um there's a petition there so they have
10 signatures let's see if we can get to
100 right at the end of this week well
not the end of this week but by the end
of next week all right
um and after Tech news and we're going
to check out my
sweet tricks analytics and while this is
happening let's talk about Samsung's new
Galaxy s23 plus
all right I'm sorry for the mistake
there I met the entire s23 Series so
yeah Samsung has a Samsung
um unpacked event coming up Wednesday
um um that is a
the Wednesday the first the first day in
February and I'm really excited for it
some people aren't really excited for
the s22 uh s23 series as it looks like
being itinerative update but I mean I'm
doing okay battery life but this s23
series looks to be like a battery life
Champion a battery life monster it looks
really good on paper you have a 2010 amp
hour battery life increase I would like
to see a four thousand milliamp hour
battery life I mean but size in the s23
um as the s20 has that but you know it
has some dumped down features no wqhd
screen it's actually slightly smaller
than Destiny so so that's fine also the
curved screen so I guess that's the
screen real estate
um yeah but the battery life and the
chip make it to be make it out to look
like one of the best battery phones of
2023 at least that's what I saw in the
Twitter post and also my own
conjugations
um except for the uh Ultra the ultra
will still have 5 000 milliamp battery
but it will have the new chip all right
um
I think this LG phone gets good battery
life I'm not sure anyway
um so now the s23 series does also come
with you know new tip which brings new
performance updates the ultra will not
have 12 gigs of RAM unless you get the
500 12 gigabyte version which is okay I
guess I like that it's still coming with
the S Pen I'm really excited for this 24
series but I'm I'm glad that Samsung's
doing what it needs to do putting in
um the hours and the time to improve the
chip improve the battery life across the
board and that's where I'm excited for
Samsung unpacked and the s22 plus all
right now let's go check out some
