<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 4525</h1>
<pre>Hello everybody and welcome to the This
Week in the Tech Boy podcast. Breaking
news coming in just now as Christy
Lamont has conceded the race uh to me as
uh we're about to uh win. So hopefully
that happens as it's going out live
right now. Um when it goes out over on
those channels, it's going to be like an
hour after. So uh yeah, breaking news
over there on here. It's probably going
to be a shorter podcast episode today.
Not much happened in uh technology news.
Nintendo did release their new Nintendo
uh uh Switch Switch 2 delayed here in
the United States, but uh we can still
talk about the specifications of this
device. And you know, I was actually
scrolling through Kora uh you know, the
answering website. Um you know, I was
trying to find some of those like stupid
people questions on there because you
know, like if you cannot emulate
something, if you don't know something,
like we we we always did this. So, uh,
you
know, you can at least try to read about
dumb people who did it over on Quora and
Reddit. It's always a fun time over
there reading the amount of dumb people
that are on that
uh on on that website. And there like
the amount of dumb people that do stupid
things over there. Uh, like, you know,
having parties and bringing horses into
them. Uh, and then the horse, you know,
messes up the living room and they have
to do all kinds of things to get out of
there. I mean, stuff that you can't even
make up for SSLW. I mean, SSLW the
election, the the book, right? We have,
you know, a literal scooter chase. Never
in a million years would I have thought,
you know, hey, let's have a horse come
into the school. Well, actually, that's
a thing of cows, but, you know, let's
have a horse come into Hazel 1.0's house
and, you know, like eat the files or
something like that.
Uh yeah. So here's one thing that I was
thinking about is like journalists,
right? You know, they have these news
websites, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, AP News,
all these people. They have these news
websites, right? And it's great. They
report the news. They type in what what
they're supposed to type in, you know,
especially AP, you know, they formed in
like 1846. I think they were one of the
first reporters to report over on the
civil war to use, you know, Morse code,
telegram, telegraphs, all kinds of
things like that to communicate with
their field reporters.
Uh, and like where do the reporters
actually go find stories? Like
how like like how how on earth did they
find out stories? Especially, you know,
back then, you know, always in these
Adventure Odyssey episodes, you have
these kids who come in and are like,
"Oh, well, you know, uh, there's this
thing going on." And then they'll go
into like the student newspaper archives
and investigate something. You even see
things like of this nature, uh, in like
the real newspaper over there, like
Odyssey Press, uh, First Press,
something like that. And the reporters
are going out to investigate something
like what where do they get this
information? like you know and I think
people have actually gotten worse at
this. That's why the news is so boring.
Like you know there's this application
called Citizen that reports all the
crimes that are happening near you in
real time. There's this house by me
that's been like broken into once or
twice. Uh and it's it's really
interesting. Like a house is actually
broken into but when you go search the
headline or search up the address to go
find um the news reports out of the
local affiliates uh you know we have Fox
affiliates here. We have KPC and then
there's KHOU. I don't know who affiliate
they are there, but those at the top
like three news channels they have on TV
for free and then you have the website.
So, of course, it's not going to be
recorded like cable news or CNN or
whatever. Uh there's nothing about the
house break and just like some boring
thing that's coming up here. Let me just
go on. Let me pull up
KO1 and
just not not the not the weather but the
actual news here. Here's a
KH11. These are some headlines uh that
they have presented here. I'm just going
over to their website. I was talking
about the severe weather that we're
having or whatever. Cougs fans
representing in San Antonio ahead of
Final Four match up with Duke. Yeah.
See, it's like obviously duh. I mean,
obviously that's a big story here, but I
I find it more interesting to have more
of like a local news affiliate that
would report uh you know, news that's on
Citizen that's already pre-reported for
them as well. Um, speaking of the Final
Four, uh, you know, they have this in in
basketball, like I'm always confused.
Like in the final four, they have the
cheerleaders that are sitting like right
there on the ground. Okay? Like in in
NBA games, right? I've actually been to
NBA games. I've never been to a college
basketball game. In NBA games, you know,
cheerleaders come out like during
halftime to go like, you know, celebrate
whoever did the half court shots and
give them the money that they won. uh
they come out for like the beginning of
the game like when if they do the
national game and then they're gone,
right? They they're gone, right? They're
not really a big part of the game.
Doesn't really matter. We're here to
watch basketball, not some like people
do some flips. Anyway, in college
basketball, they're like right there on
the uh on the lines like right behind
the goals and then right behind them you
have like the band members. Uh so like
what what would happen if oh I don't
know someone does a bad pass and you get
smacked in the face or you know
someone's trying to jump you know the
ball's going out of bounds jumping in
and you like you jumped on one of the
cheerleaders or band members there like
why are they right behind her and
especially why are they sitting on the
ground it doesn't really uh make sense
uh for that as well speak uh but you
know what doesn't really make sense and
it is this the light phone 3 guys this
is the uh light phone 3
uh and you know What? You know, Light is
playing all the games and you know, I
I'm a huge critic of them. Does look
like a pretty neat device. It does have
more buttons than my phone. So,
congratulations to Light for that one as
well. But, I'm a huge critic of this
company. Like, I mean, look look at
these prices. $799 for this a phone that
would not pass. It would not fly in
2007. They'd be like, "Bro, we have the
Nokia N95 here." Like maybe if you're
upgrading uh from uh pretending just
assuming that you're going to be in the
year of our world 2007 if upgrading from
like a flip phone or something like that
maybe. But no. Uh-uh. No. Okay. This
this light phone or any light phone for
that matter. It's just it it I mean
Lightphone is probably one of the
greatest legal con companies of all of
all time. you know, they release a phone
that purposely has zero features and
then they have this Light Phone 3 and
we're going to going to get into the
features they have here that still has
the same feature set as a, you know,
smartphone from 2007. So now they can go
around and be like, "Hey guys, look, we
added some more features and, you know,
they technically be right and they'll
never run out of ideas. They're never
going to run out of, you know, model
ideas like when you go between the
Samsung X S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra. Oh,
well, you know, it's lighter and, you
know, has a slightly different chip and
that's that's what the selling point is
going to have to be, right? Like, yeah,
but I mean, Light Phone can be like,
this phone has a camera and our last
phone didn't, right? So, they can just
essentially just, you know, reccon the
last 10 years of smartphone achievement
in se 2017. So, more like the last 15
years of smartphone achievement and on
when they're on the light phone 36, they
can catch up to Samsung Galaxy
S24. Nonetheless, I mean, they were
playing every single game. So, we're
going to get to the uh specifications
here, but let me see if I can read uh
the
thing. Wait, where is it? I was I was
reading the website yesterday when I was
preparing uh for this segment, right?
They have this whole nice, you know,
kind of minimalist aesthetic little
website black and white here going on.
So, here we go. A tool for better life.
Introducing the Light Phone 3. a tool
designed to give you the flourish as a
thoughtful, intentional version of
yourself. So, we're just going to count
the amount of games they're playing
here. Thoughtful and intentional version
of yourself. All right, game number one.
They're playing the digital minimalism
um thing here. That's again a trend on
Instagram, which this phone doesn't
have. So, yeah, you know, no one's
actually minimalistic, you know, for the
fun of it. Okay. No one no one's going
around, you know, hey guys, look, I like
to I'm rich, but I actually like to live
my life in black and white and have no
color and uh you
know, on on my screen. Like, no, not
even a metaphor. Like, I actually like
to live my life in black and white. You
know, if they had glasses that I could
only see in black and white, I like
that. I'm a minimalist. Of course, I
have this like weird looking house, but
has nothing in it, you know? Has an open
floor plan for the friends I don't have
to come over. Nonetheless, right, so the
minimalism uh trend game there, that's
game number one. All right, game number
two. We know how difficult can be go
against the grain of society that seems
ready to made to distract you. That's
why we uh created life 3. All right,
game number two. It's the uh hey guys,
you know, society bad game. Yeah, it's
kind of like when you're in youth church
and like, hey kids, you know, want you
ready to get do something with Jesus? We
want you to fast for 30 days to get off
of social media. yada yada yada. All
right, the game number three, digital
detox. It's a huge trend uh online. kind
of weird, but you know, it's like the
entire trend of people who hate the
internet yelling and and crying about it
on the internet. Uh, you know, and
you're saying, "Oh, you want to pay more
attention to your toddler? You're buying
your very first phone." It's maybe
they're trying to like sell these to
kids, which is kind of stupid because
the phone wolf
$600 and uh, you know, it's trash. It's
absolute garbage. All right. And here
here's your phone here. Oh, yes. And
game number four. Uh it's not
specifically stated here, but they're
playing to the e- in community game. The
e- in community is small in numbers, but
they are mighty. So, you know, people
love e- in. Uh so game, that's game
number four here. We future proof this
phone so that we can provide meaningful
software updates blah blah blah blah
blah. And they go in and talk about how
they hate, you know, uh what you call uh
obsolescent
uh planned planned obsolescence, right?
Except the thing is like this phone is 3
in and
like you're going to get tired of it in
a U. So obviously it's going to be like
planned obsolescence. Also, you know,
they they have to like kind of trickle
down the features uh in here. Like maybe
the next year they'll be like, "Hey, we
added some video recording features to
the phone." You know, they they cannot
add too many features to the phone
because then people just going to buy
it. And then of course, you know, since
they're catering to this niche,
especially the plan obsolescence niche,
the the digital minimalism niche, oh, I
don't need to buy anything new. So, uh,
then they'll come into school and
they'll go under. All right. Anyway,
yep, that's was that game number four or
game number five. Anyway, here goes the
camera part. I almost forgot about that.
They added their own camera. And of
course, they're going back to nostalgia.
Game number five or six. I'll go back in
editing and count the amount of games
that they're doing here. Taking
inspiration from their favorite point
and shoot cameras. And they try to pass
this off as with center focus and a
fixed focal length. Yeah, guys, no
autofocus is a feature now. Yes, you
know that trash dual camera you had back
in 2003, it is now on this phone and you
will thank them for it because memories,
you
know. Now, uh, you know, give credit
where credit is due. This phone does
have a metal frame, which is nice. You
know, some people like that. It's like
actual feature. uh USBC, fingerprint,
fast light, 5G, and FC chip, which I
having a I was all for fingerprint
scanners on phones, you know, as you
guys know, like my interest in
technology was always, you know, like
they you can't ever chart. My interest
in like uh uh you know, espionage um
charting with my interest in technology
would be like a perfect one to one
ratio. Like I wanted my first phone to
have a fingerprint scanner so I could go
around and collect people's fingerprints
and then like match them up when I got
them from databases. Unfortunately,
there are no apps that do that at this
time. So, yeah. Um, nonetheless, why
does this phone have a fingerprint
scanner? Like, like I said, I'm one to
one. I'm all for fingerprint scanners.
I'm all for like espionage, which is why
I said, "Oh, yeah, guys. I like Pegasus.
I like the Israeli spyware. People hated
me for that." Anyway, why does this
phone have a fingerprint ID? What are
you going to protect? Your uh text
messages from your three friends. Okay,
it's not like you're getting anything
important because you know the important
people are actually using phones from
the last decade. Okay? like uh you know
all this technology here was re in the
Noki N95 except for the fingerpoint ID
and of course 5G which didn't exist.
Also again if you're trying to say that
your phone has a flashlight and it's on
the main page of the website. Yeah, you
know there are no features on this phone
at all. Also um what do you think about
this two-toned like you couldn't keep
the same like black you couldn't afford
like we ran out of paint or something
like why why does this look kind of
green? Maybe it's just the screen, but
then you know, maybe I should have used
a better camera to take a picture of
their uh phone here, which kind of
reminds me of like an iPod. Why is this
thing $600? And they try to tell you
that as a discount, okay, it's made to
last. Do do we really need a new single
phone every single year? Can our phones
last 5 years, 10 years? I mean, sure,
I'm pretty sure it will will last. I'm
just Yeah. It says, "Play obsolescence
remains an outrage to us." No, no, it
doesn't. No, it doesn't. It is not an
outrage to you. Look, if you guys could
actually make a real phone that actually
worked and could uh you know, break into
the market, you know, you'd actually do
that. Okay. Uh but, you know, since you
couldn't do that, you decided to make
3-in phones that um are now talking
about their non-autofocus camera and a
uh you know, a flashlight as the big new
features of the device. Also, you know,
I don't know if the camera takes it in
color, but you know, since the screen is
eating, I think it's only black and
white. So, you know, uh there there's
that.
Uh all right. So, I mean, look at this
text. Imagine trying to text on this
thing. Also, I remember when we were
reacting to the Light Phone, too. It
came out and I'm doubting the screen
technology is any different. Why is
there a webcam on this thing? What are
you going to do? Video calling people in
uh black and white HD. Nonetheless, also
aren't selfies against, you know, the
minimalism people. Uh anyway, like what
what is
this? Let's let's see where game number
seven is. Oh. Uh also, there's this
whole blur about how people use this as
their secondary phone. I'm sorry if
you're sending $600 as a secondary
phone. I like this phone is just made
for rich people, okay? Like no one's
going to be giving their kid this phone
because, you know, like if you're going
to spend $1,000 on a phone, might as
well, you know, pay for, you know, an
actual phone.
All right. There's a nice speaker grill
here for, you know, I don't think
there's any streaming on here. So, uh,
you have to go buy your MP3s the
oldfashioned way,
which, you know, is it kind of harder
now back than than it was back then
because now everyone's moved to like
Spotify and Apple Music. And of course,
you can download your stuff on there.
All
right. Oh, yeah. See, we have the
navigation thing here, which is just
like,
why? Also, look at the bezels on this
thing. Bezel, bezel, bezel. 2017 called.
They want their phone back. And then
they will turn it back in. Also, you
know, they're trying to like uh that
button is going to be used a lot. the uh
the talk but talking to the phone button
because like trying to type on this
thing absolutely no not gonna work uh
yeah obviously it's running light OS
it's actually called Android okay and
here are the tools that are available
again imagine if you have a phone from
uh you know this makes sense for 2007
for you know future phones flip phones
uh in 202 in 2025 people are going to
people going to be like hey guys my
phone has an alarm calculator a calendar
it can even play music podcast timers.
You be looking at you like what? Also
notice the game that they're playing
here
again. Alarm and timer or f on here
twice. Alarm, timer. Yeah, usually
that's called clock. Uh, you know, I'm
actually shocked they didn't put um
available tools include clock, alarm,
timer, world clock. You guys can know
what time it is in Israel. You guys can
know what time it is in the UK. You guys
can know what time it is in India. All
while on the same phone that cost $600.
Isn't that impressive?
Also, you know, then they have the
whole, "Oh, guys, this is handcrafted
and we we pay employees good wages and
uh you know, this phone was made with
love
uh uh whole thing here." And then once
again, the big tech hating thing.
Everyone hates big tech except for me
because look look our phones don't have
the top little 10 most popular apps. No
sir, no sir. We are far above. Well,
Apple's not really an app. So, let's
count. We are far above Google. Imagine
having Google on your phone, even though
we actually use the operating system,
but let's forget that. Oh, we are so far
above having X. We're so far above
having Snapchat, which I mean I mean of
any of these apps. I mean, Snapchat
should not be on your phone uh on the
light phone, not on your personal phone
cuz like what are you going to take a
picture of? Oh, guys, look, it's a weird
face of me at 3:00 in the morning in
black and white.
Hey guys, we got Instagram again. Like
what a useless app. Uh on this phone and
Amazon, which I guess they don't like
Amazon because, you know, you can
exchange goods at a decent price and
then you get goods, you know, quickly.
You know, capitalism, free trade, blah
blah blah. Yes, exactly. Exactly. It is
a toy phone, but with extra
steps. He gets
it. Uh yeah. Okay. Yeah. Like what was
how dare you have Amazon in there?
Capitalism, free trade. We we can't have
any of that. No, sir. No, sir. We want
you ordering like direct to a person.
Not even ordering, you know, over the
internet cuz uh you know, we actually
don't want you to use our phone that
much. You know, we want you to pay $600
for a phone that's trash. So then you
don't use the phone, but you actually
keep the phone because, you know, you're
digital minimalism minimalism and you
actually like, you know, you hate big
tech and you want to stick it to them,
whatever. Well, so actually gonna have
to send in your packages via mail. Okay.
Uh the the Pony Express actually. No, no
Morse code people. No, no Telegrams. No
telegraphs. All right. We're on a
mission. Yes. It's always these random
like small companies of three people
working for them. They're always on
these like weird missions to come. I'll
change the world. You're not going to
change the world. Honest pricing.
Honest. They say yes, guys. $800 for a
phone that if you introduced it in uh
2010, they'd be looking at you like,
"What is wrong with you?" Now, just
pretend that the phone had 3G instead
of, you know, 5G, okay? Because, you
know, 5G techn didn't even exist. Hey
guys, guys, look, I have this great
phone. We're going to be selling it for
uh I I don't know what inflation would
be back then. So, let's say $600. Let's
say $600 in 2010. It' be worth $800 in
2024 or 25, whatever. All right. Hey
guys, I had this great phone. It's $600.
Black and white touchscreen. So, it's
like an iPhone but like in black and
white. It doesn't have any apps or it
only plays, you know, local things,
local content. And um
uh yeah, that's it. Oh, how Oh, how much
did you say it cost? Oh, yeah. $600.
Plus, you're going to have to pay you a
contract. They would kick you out of it.
Be like, who wants to buy a black and
white non iPhone?
Like if you want a black and white
phone, go back to 2002 and get a flip
phone from that era. They like honest
pricing. We have no third party apps
that sneakily take your data. All right.
Yeah, great. Honestly, if uh if if this
company was honest, they'd be like, "We
have no third party apps." That's the
honest thing. You can add, "Oh, they
take your data." Well, yeah, but they're
actually useful. Um so yeah, that that's
the Light Phone 3. They're playing like
six or seven games here. Um the one the
one game that they are not playing is
uh yeah the one game that they're not
playing
is the oh wow the the photos are in
color. All right. So that's great.
Anyway, the one game that they're not
playing is the eco-friendly game which I
expect the Light phone for to have. You
know that's the one thing that Fone has
over them. But let's go through the
games that they are playing uh once
again. So they're playing the nostalgia
game. They're playing the digital
minimalism game. uh the uh the just
minimalism game at all. They're playing
the digital detox game. They're playing
the
uh they're playing like the
repairability
uh anti- establishment game. They're
playing the e inc game. They're playing
the uh they're playing like the weird,
you know, they're playing like the
photography game, too. But, you know,
not actually that good at photography,
but you know, like just the like just
the aesthetic. Okay. This the whole
company is just an aesthetic. But like
if the stock the stock price, you know,
it's like you have these meme coins,
meme tokens. It's just an aesthetic.
Like all the hype is just an aesthetic.
And then they're playing the anti- big
tech game and the anti- we don't sell
data game, yada yada yada. All right. I
was watching an interview for an actual
CEO of an actual company of Snapchat
here. Uh I was watching him on diary of
a CEO, which is like a YouTube channel.
They go around and they interview CEOs
of companies. You know, I haven't seen
the Light Phone CEO on there. Uh,
correct me if I'm wrong, but anyway, it
was like a two-hour long interview, but
he was actually talking about something
that was kind of important, right? His
parents, they let him build uh his
parents didn't let him watch TV, but
they did let him build a computer when
he was 12 years old. So, I went up, he
said he was in sixth grade, so I'm just
going to assume 12 years old. Uh, so I
looked it up. He was born in 1990, which
means his computer when he built this
was around 2002, maybe
2001. So, just think the Novaccom era
for all the Adventure Odyssey fans that
are listening. Of course, there's no one
listening right now, but uh on replay,
you know, I have Advention Odyssey fans
who listen. All right. And so, he's 12
years old. He's building his own
computer and his his parents said,
"Yeah, we'll let you build your
computer, but you can't connect it to an
internet." Which gives me leads me to
this grand like interesting question
like what what was he doing on the
computer? Like again, it's the same
problem that we have now. what are
people doing actually doing on the
computers without you know the internet
and that's why I was on this website
called softedia called get multimedia
but uh soft media uh which is a website
that shows all these applications and I
was actually pleasantly to surprise to
see that there was and this is on
internet because I still haven't
answered the question like what what he
was doing on the computer uh and we can
talk more about Snapchat uh when we get
into that segment but
like what like really what was he doing
on that computer and there's core thread
actually brought me much comfort. And
then there's another core thread that's
just like deranged idiots. Uh yeah,
because um I've I want to talk about my
new strategy here where we just reply to
a lot of people over on exon like the
uh the like there's this guy called
internet hall of fame just finds like
these random screenshots and random
videos and for I was racking my brain
thinking like where are they getting
these videos? Where are they getting
this content? the family just getting it
off of Reddit and Instagram. And you
know, look, I hate the I hate that
people get famous by reposting this
content, but look, we have to win, okay?
We we have to grow this business here.
Like, we we do not make money, okay?
Like uh we actually have to make some uh
money here. So, you're going to be
seeing some interesting changes um
coming coming uh to to the channel,
right? So, if you're saying, "Oh, why
are you posting all these random videos
and like memes from Kora of a whole
bunch of stupid people?" There's an
entire subreddit for stupid people on
Kora. We can have an entire entire
episode about all those stupid people
over on core.
Uh yeah. So uh but you know this this
cord, right? Unlike the other one, there
was some person talking about like what
would happen if ducks rose up and uh
stole the means production or something
like that. Like no one cares about your
communist sentient ducks. Okay, I added
in the communist part, but I'm pretty
sure that's a cool thing as well. I'm
pretty sure people love their comm
ducks.
Anyway, what about computers? especially
like laptops back during 1999. So this
is like three years uh before he built
his uh computer, the Snapchat CEO and
the people used computers internet
pretty much back then. And this guy
built his own computer in
1978. Bro, he looks like that guy from
that Lord of the Rings movie that
everyone like apparently watched and now
is like all over not to be like bro
could you not use Lord of the Rings and
what's that other book? Hobbit something
uh analogies. Hey guys, this guy's just
like Gandalf who's fighting the orcs of
the lost power of the rings. Well, no
one knows what you're yapping about.
Anyway, what were computers, especially
like laptops back in 1999? At some point
point in the 1990s, I got a secondhand
laptop to use on my boat. So, this
assumes it's like 95 96. So, we're like
six years behind. But, you know, you
know, I'm pretty sure they didn't build
like the really best best computer. So,
you know, maybe we're like just a few
years behind in tech. Look at these
specs here. And it's kind of
interesting. Like my phone is more
powerful than this. So if you just think
about this, it's just that computers
used to be really really popular because
they could do these things that, you
know, phones could not because you know,
you know, cell phones didn't really
exist at this time. Uh they did, but you
know, they weren't that popular and also
didn't have that much power. It's just
that like my phone is more powerful than
this computer. So you know, we really
really shouldn't feel guilty about being
on it. This look at the specs. There's a
386 CPU. I there's no way for me to
quantify whatever that means. Not much
RAM, a small hard disc, and a 3.5 in
floppy disc drive. No CD drive, no
Wi-Fi, no Ethernet, no Bluetooth, no
there's no way that
uh there's no internet on this computer
at all. Like no way you could get it. No
Bluetooth, no Ethernet. No, no Wi-Fi.
So, I mean, did I have a phone jack?
Maybe get a modem or something. Uh
probably a serial interface. I forget. I
put Linux on it using a stack of floppy
discs. I forgot what the screen was
like. May have been monochrome before I
attended. It actually did work.
Interesting. He could transfer files or
floppies. No watching movies. Uh that'
be kind of interesting. Like think about
a laptop from the 90s that could play
like
VHS's you know you know computers used
to run off of you know cassette tape. So
I know like much smaller
but like you know laptops were kind of
thick back then. They could you know you
could stick a VHS in there. Obviously,
you could stick a VHS in a desktop
computer. Uh the CPU couldn't handle
more than a 128 pixel wide video, which
is really interesting because, you know,
we have 4K video that can just play on
our phones
natively if we wanted to. So, like look
how much technology has come. Around the
same time, I got a new laptop with a
logic analyzer. I looked up what there
was. I have no idea why it cost
$200,000, but just analyzes electrical
signals. How like for 200 $20,000 for a
logic analyzer? Are you kidding me? I'm
pretty sure you could just make one of
those with an Arduino nowadays compared
to my current lap. We don't know what
that is. Uh but yeah, here's the laptop.
Kind of really interesting to think that
like my phone is more powerful than
this. Like he was just using this like
write documents. Let's see what kind of
interface we got. Got some PGA. Oh. Oh,
this must be the new one because that's
some USB right there. So yeah. Yeah.
Kind of interesting. like he was just
writing documents on this thing, you
know, and is it pretty useful, you know,
transferring files to the floppy discs
and um you know that's probably what the
Snapchat CEO was doing or maybe playing
some uh games as
well. Um another interesting thing is
like those games, you know, land games.
Uh I like why why they take that
functionality out of games. Not like I
care I care from like a psychological
perspective like because like I have
nothing else to care about.
Uh yeah. Anyway, back to the Snapchat
CEO guy. He
uh Snapchat I think he said it came out
in like
2010. He actually did this as a way this
2010 to transfer photos between two
people but faster than what sending a
SMS might have been which is really
interesting. But like why do they still
exist to to this day? Like has Teen Pack
lobby you know Team Team has been on a
roll. Uh Tik Tok has been uh unbanned
for another 75 days. So uh
congratulations to Team Pack. Uh once
again, Patriotism surges, yada yada
yada. Um maybe I'll redo the video.
Maybe I won't have like the team pack
people standing like right here and then
have the national anthem and the flag
flying or whatever. Uh nonetheless, uh
good for them. But like, well, have they
have they been lobbying the Snapchat CEO
as well, too? Cuz like I want to
Snapchat make money. No one in their
right mind is like Snapchat AI is just
like dumb. Uh, actually, Gemini 2.0.
I've actually been able to get my hands
on it and try it out. Seems, you know,
pretty decent. Uh, maybe we can have a
segment on that. Anyway, Snapchat AI is
just dumb. Why would you pay for
Snapchat premium? All of um Snapchat's
videos are just like seeing this random
man who's fat go around and trying to
date these other woman or men, but uh
anyway, he tries to date someone uh who
he kind of looks like a man because like
he's 500 pound so no one can tell. And
then they have like this woman who's
like 120 lb like dragging him around
like, "Hey guys, would you like to I'm
your sister." Like, "Oh, wow. Wow. Guys,
look." I guess they think she's pretty.
So they think, "Oh, maybe her sister's
going to be pretty." And then, you know,
like the only way to attract it to her
is because like gravitational force.
Hey, this is Gemini to Let's go with
Gemini. Let's see what Gemini says about
this. Emily, as I'm pulling up Gemini,
uh yeah, so like I said, Snapchat is uh
like terrible for video. No one's going
to pay for premium. Their AI sucks. So
like sending photos cost them money,
goes through their
servers. So like how much are people
paying for the filters on there? not
customers, but like the the ad people.
How how much how much are the ad people
paying for filters? Like I got like I'm
pretty sure it's like a Hind filter or
something like that. I I don't remember
this. Like I'm allow this app all the
time. A I only have anyone to talk to on
there and b like I'm not a teen girl. So
yeah. All right. Anyway, here's Gemini.
Oh, let's see what the gravitational uh
let's see how smart Gemini 2.0 is. What
is the
The average man is like what 100? The
average woman's 170 pounds in United
States. I don't know. So, let's go with
uh
190. All right, let's see what Gemini
says about the gravitational attraction
on a 500 pound object on 100 pound
object. I can't believe I said li
anyway. Kilograms. We got to use these
common units. All right. So, it converts
it to chemical kilograms. Let's say uh
let's say
uh distance is I don't know what 3 feet.
Let's pretend it's like co but like
not. There you go. The distance is three
feet. So, let's find out how much
attraction Gorak the destroyer has on
these four random men. So, it's uh got
to put this in meters. Okay. This is all
right. And
it's
1.560* 10^ the 6 negative6 sorry Newton.
So that's that's the most attraction
that he she whatever will ever uh get uh
from anyone. All right.
Um so yeah that's Snapchat for you.
Bunch
of 10 to the 6* 1.3 uh Newton people
walking around here.
uh you know
like and I'm pretty sure and
unfortunately I can't poll this cuz you
know if I could poll this I'd be friends
with them but if I knew like enough
teenage girls to poll then I'd find out
how much of them have actually engaged
with a paid filter. Let me open up my
Snapchat on here, you
know. Let's open up uh let me open up
Snapchat
here. And I'm just going to swipe
through what the paid filters are on
here. The United States Navy is the
first filter on here. How much do they
pay for this? Uh it's actually in the
game, so you know. Shut up. Uh, let's
see what
another filter on here is.
Uh, well, doesn't look like the paid
ones are probably got maybe I don't, you
know, interact with them. Uh, you know,
there's also like filters that you
yourself can pay for, which I I don't
know why anyone would do that. Like,
what what are you going to become like
total teenage queen of uh of your queen
of your friends or whatever. Uh, you
know, even that would be like a sad plot
for a book. Imagine SSLTW, but like you
know, everyone's just fighting over
Snapchat. All right, speaking of SSA,
LTW, you know, I would really like to
write a book about, you know, SS LTW the
like the web series, you know, pick up
from right off as Ethan Shay, uh, you
know, lunch runs of Resin. But the
problem with that is is that SLTW the
web series is, you know, like 99%
accurate. Okay, like we're just going to
change a few things of course other than
the names. But you know it's 99%
accurate based on you know actual source
material actual classified documents.
That's why the website's called SSA the
classified. But with the book series you
know we move into uh it ends in November
of ambiguous year. We didn't actually
give it a year but it ends in November
of
2023. Uh because like the latest thing
is S22 plus. So it it at least happens
within the year of 2020 after the year
of 2022, right? But we didn't date it so
that you know it's still relevant to the
three people who bought it in the year
2029. But like it it'd be near
impossible to try to merge the series
together. Okay? Like I said, we're
trying to become a teen and tech media
company here, right? Because that's
that's where the money is. There's
always going to be teenagers and you
know, there's nothing much out there for
them. Like remember when we went to 17
magazine it was like five ways you might
know if you're gay like no one cares.
Okay like bro like when did your logo
become the pride flag? Nonetheless
uh the the problem with this is is that
in SLW the the book the election the
book right we start off in August and we
end up in in November. So it spans three
months of our time. However, in SLTW the
web series, you know, we're spanning
multiple times as well, right? The thing
is that the election CLTW the web series
is held in September which means that
you know of the actual you know
president which you know I unfortunately
lost because you know I was brand new
which means if we go by the way that the
book series plays it where Ethan Shay
wins then like half the problems in LTW
the web series like oh I don't know
someone you threatening to like throw
Hydro Flask at other people wouldn't
happen because I'd be like, "Well, no,
we we can't have that." Uh, you know,
oh, the uh
the like just all like the student
council, you know, episodes or posts on
the website, you like, "No, this this
doesn't really make any much sense,
right?" And also, you know, there's this
whole like trend thing of operation
Babbling Brook project 2024. There's
like there's an entire thread through
the entire series where it's just like,
hey guys, we need uh Ethan Sherry needs
to go to Babbling Brook before the end
of the show and he's going to be
manipulating all these events so that
this happens. when Eth and S is LTW
election the book you know Ethan Chase
is like running around the town uh like
speed running on a electric scooter
holding rallies in the middle of the
mall and like you know in the back of a
car like you know this this really
important plot point in the back of a
car with some well actually know what's
her name uh Sienna not not Sienna
what's some Sienna some go with an s
name anyway some girl with an s name
who's a totally new character. Oh,
uh, let me let me pull up her name.
Anyway, some girl, some 11th grade girl
from s name. Um, Sydney. Yeah, there we
go. From Sydney spills the tea, comes up
and and is like, you know, is like on
Ethan's team. And, you know, she's
driving Ethan and Maverick, Ethan and
Maverick on the back of the car, right?
While Maverick is talking to Hazel on
video call uh to a volleyball game. And
then Ethan makes his appearance into the
volleyball game. There's fog, there's
smoke, uh ex and he he opens in like
everyone's chanting and everything like
that, right? Yeah. Um if Ethan is just
in the back of the car, you know, of of
random like non family member students
and then like, you know, two months
later he's like, "Oh, well, you know, I
need approval to like go stand outside.
Hey guys, let's uh let's uh you know,
Gcam, I I I really have to do this with
him." Like, no, he's been running around
with Gcam. uh you know like literally
running running an election uh and
running around like malls and stuff like
that for like the entire series so it's
not really going to mesh well like you
know the the entire book is just
essentally like a fever dream. Um well
like it is based on real events which is
why you know Addison became in president
because it really really makes sense why
President Addison would like with like
the whole homecoming thing in the web
series. So like it is based off the web
series.
Sorry guys, we lost power. Anyway, it's
based off events in the web series, but
like you know it it takes creative
liberties, right? essentially like a
whole fever dream of like hey what would
happen if you know Ethan Shade did this
plus we add like seven times more kids
plus like you know we just like pretend
restrictions don't exist plus like you
know the school's in a totally different
spot okay like like in in in the books
in the woods in in in in the web series
which is totally it's it's not okay
anyway so yeah that's uh why we can't
base a book off the thing but we can
base a book off the end of the thing and
we also may have a new book coming off
exploring Molly, Valerie, Elijah, and
the entire cast of people who lost uh
back backstories. Uh should we give
Allison a backstory? Maybe, maybe not.
Um but yeah, anyways, going back to
Sswa. This can just be an SLW episode
because like we have two podcast topics
to talk about. So, Perplexity did have
have this new feature. They have a
circle to search and so uh on your
device. So that's that's interesting if
you're interesting uh if interested in
that as well. But you know back to the
whole you know restrictions thing. Uh
here we are with the SA
LTW website. We have Watergate where we
finally get to tell you about how I bug
G cam totally and legally. All right. Oh
wait. Oh. Oh wait. Wow. We have so many
so many posts to get to. Uh so the last
time we talked about this it was the
29th. So I have to go back and see.
Okay. So you guys play evangelical. Here
we have March 31st. This is exactly
report on the effectiveness and ease of
an external ally meet up March 2024.
Totally will report. It's actually
posted to the internet um in March of
2024. So if you guys can go find the
original Google doc of that,
congratulations to my little O centers.
And uh I only changed like one word in
here. And then I just merged it on to
another report from the 29th. Pretend it
was from the same day. Like I said, you
know, we kind of like change the dates
and thing times with this things like uh
there's going to be like this study hall
scene where like some kids trying to
like deport some other kid. We got to
kind of like merge those into one scene
and yeah, that does not make any sense
without context. Doesn't make any sense
in context. I live through the context.
It still didn't make any sense, but who
cares whatever. Anyway, here's the uh
report on the and also this text here is
also added here because I tried to like
that make it make sense. I'm not just
gonna like upload some random document
up here. It has to like mess within the
story. Anyway, SSA intelligence is
trying to figure out the probability
score of key allies meeting up in an
external place outside the school and
analyze what happens outside the school
in varying situations. And that's what I
always like to say like uh you know if
you can't live through a situation, you
have to like use Reddit or core to find
out what other people are doing.
Unfortunately, before this website was
created because uh yeah um and you know
AI wasn't as good, they were totally
completely unhelpful. So, if there's any
other kids out there who are reading
this website or watching the stream,
which no, because it's zero people
reading and watching right now,
uh, well, hopefully this helps out the
people who don't read. So, yeah. So
anyway, SA performs internal
investigations and talks about the
trickle down woolomics which essentially
says you know any rule that happens to
Ethan Shay and will since they get
passed down to Maverick and the other
kids we actually haven't come up with a
name for that. So, uh, it's going to
come key and important, uh, to the other
kids, right? Since he happened at the
same time, which is great for the other
kids now because like, you know,
essentially let's say Ethan Shay's like
trying to use a stove at age 12, you
know, the other kids going to be using
at age seven or whatever. So, you know,
congratulations for him, but Ethan Shay,
you know, he's they're going to be at
the same time. So when kid two or three
of Mavic whatever is at the same time
when Ethan Jay is at then you know he'll
be you know probably more advanced rules
of chance that's challenging the
non-existence of certain teen centric
rules is prevalent advanced laws seem
unnecessary due to the fact it's from
societal level kids yada yada yada this
entire point was just written for CSM/
not to be right this this entire point
was just like hey guys guys look we're
good people okay this this is this just
posted onto uh Reddit into CSM. Uh, by
the way, this the president having a boy
come over, yada yada yada. We go over to
2017 president, yada yada yada. And then
we go, why is this in black? Okay.
Anyway, I have to change this back to
white. Uh, this is a report that seeks
to find a parental precedent on a yes
and no and a potential out of school
moral outing within the first half of
2024. Common belief is that it would not
be allowed statistically, but there is a
proverbial wick room within the
president, presumably if our allies
request me to put a make friends act of
2019 to 2022. See, this is what I did in
my free time. I had nothing better to
do. Like literally nothing. Okay, I'm
over here reading like legal documents
of this. And this this is actual real
research that I actually did. So, um
yeah, this is I'm not making this stuff
up. Imagine imagine like making up some
legal documents like tell tell you a
story of friends and everything.
Anyway, to make your own uh make friends
was an act that mandated that I sit at a
table if I was invited to lunch even if
I didn't want to. Thank you Liberty Prep
and uh NA for that one there. Uh not
really but uh there's actress cars in my
time in Christian school online school.
No, not really. It's well yeah you guys
s if you want to teleport uh from public
school 10th grade and first have 11
papers invoked multiple times when
Oops. Whoops. I have to go fix that. Uh
make your own decision implied to
internet activity as defend defined by
mine as line yada yada ya. You guys can
read this as well. I'm going to go fix
that because it's barely you can barely
see it. Anyway, Watergate. That's the
story you guys have all been wanting to
hear. Well, I use my audio bug and audio
tape to like totally bug Gam. Look, look
at this. Look at this. And thank you to
some AI app for this where I add my
little headset on. Uh, and then we got,
you know, G cam and spy little
background here. It's designed by Freak
as tension for between the prom positive
G cam and the
event. Okay. uh SSA allies and
disagreements and destroy swirled across
TSM and people offering all sorts of
conflicting advice essentially on CSM.
The people were like, you know, they're
like, you know, you know, planning this
thing out. And I was like, okay, guys,
we we need this. We have we need to have
a plan. And they're like, well, what are
they going to wear? How the heck am I
supposed to know what they're going to
wear? I mean, these people had had seen
a for like what's wrong with you? And
yeah, that's why I'm all Kate Gate and
Odyssey War 3. Like, bro, I don't have
time for this. You know, all these
random, you know, Christians over here
like, "Oh my goodness, it's a stomach."
Goodness. Yeah.
Yeah. Again, like they have less of a
life than me, honestly. I
wrote touch glass. Nonetheless, anyway,
back headquarters, I prepped an old
phone, espionage tools, and dusted off
my headsp weeks. I let people talk into
the phone. Summer really loved that for
some reason. She was
like I I don't know why
I Anyway, uh I got a voice activated
recorder and recorder arrived cuz
remember that towback recorder I
reviewed somehow was lost. It's always
like whenever I need to go on some type
of mission but I've always been like you
know stockpiling all these spies toys
but whenever I actually need to go on an
actual real mission they're always like
gone or something. It's like we have a
nuclear like we have nuclear stockpile
but then like you know they're gone when
you actually need to nuke someone.
Anyway, the recorder arrived later,
especially if remain skeptical of Gam's
capabilities. See, the premise of this
is that Gcam was saying that they were
bu going to build a spy agency to
destroy SSA from the inside out.
However, of course, we doubt those
claims, but but remember, some of us
actually under investigation for being a
foreign agent of Liberty or Energizer.
So, I mean, it could have been true.
And, you know, they didn't make these
claims true. So that essentially just
gave us a reason
to do this and get away with it. So
you're welcome. Uh anyway, they
whispering of building a new spy agency
and destroying SSA with facts and logic.
Uh SSA still hadn't uncovered any spy
toys agencies with the tape filing
tidbits. Some asked about my favorite
food yada yada yada. We can have a whole
episode about the entire ridiculous
questions they're asking. He was like
remember November 9th, 2022. Remember
that. just this is a
May sorry March 22nd 2024.
Uh and then yada yada yada. They ask
some question about modesty. I go in and
yap about got questions because of
course I do. And then I go around get
some fake tapes here and uh uh go in and
we like help out Jayla and all these
people and
uh go in. You guys can go read this
story as well. All right. Now, we got to
get crushed where essentially I'm kicked
off at CSM says NTB. So, you know, you
guys have heard that seem to have been
there, done that. All right. Our last
thing that be supposed to talk about.
Let me pick up my Note, too. Oh, the
Nintendo Switch that came out. So, uh
it's coming out. So, interesting. It has
a really big screen. So, that's nice.
And for the last thing about meme
accounts and joke accounts, hope you
guys like those because uh that's that's
what we have to become nowadays to, you
know, become great and to to win, right?
This is the Nintendo Switch 2. Look how
big that screen
is. There's a Mario Kart World game,
which actually kind of looks interesting
because it's like open world. So that's
great. Let's see. Any any comments, any
chats?
Well, no. God bless. Uh, let's see.
Let's see what my father account is
right
now.
912. All right,
Christie. Uh, by the time you hear this,
it might be at 1,000. God bless. Tech
Talk. See you later.</pre>
