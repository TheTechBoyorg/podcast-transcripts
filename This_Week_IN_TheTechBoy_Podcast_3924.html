<h1>This Week IN TheTechBoy Podcast 3924</h1>
<pre>but it's not just
any hello and welcome to the tech booy
This Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody and welcome to
the this week in the tech board
uh podcast um plenty happened this week
in tack Media news um something good
some of it not all right so some of the
big stories from this week were mat Pat
has officially retired and his send off
videos are kind
of bad is I mean they
um we'll get into that later um um let's
see we got the Samsung s24 Ultra got a
massive update teot
TV um oh I was also
um
my
uh kie
instance um isn't working for some
reason so I downloaded the new one but
that one didn't work with my Wi-Fi
adapter so I downloaded Pirro OS and
that one also didn't work and also for
fun I made some malware sample well not
made some mware samples but used them um
off of GitHub just like fre you can open
S whatever and added my Discord tokens
and stuff to it and was able to make a
command hack into a computer with the
Discord but unfortunately
unfortunately
um all of them got detected by my
antivirus AV antivirus this isn't
sponsored not AV a asked any virus I
definitely no this isn't sponsored um so
um that's that's good for antivirus but
not not good if you know you try to hack
into someone but I guess if you try to
hack into someone you should only do it
with legal means which means you have to
have their consent or something like
that
um oh and one more thing Google's uh AI
Google Gemini AI Nano which is this on
device AI is not able to run on
uh uh what's they call the pixel 8 for
some reason for Hardware differences um
even though um it's able to run on S s23
Series the uh
Galaxy not S s24 Series which basically
has the same specs and it's larger pixel
8 Pro sibling and another weird thing is
that some of the features came to the
pixel 7 like Circle to search I think
did not come to the pixel uh fold which
cost a lot more money
and
it didn't doesn't make sense so the
pixel F has the same Hardware even
better like it has a better zoom camera
I think than the like a regular pixel 7
and so yeah that doesn't make sense why
the pixel 4 wouldn't be getting that
hard because the pixel 4 is basically
like three phones in one um one instance
combined together
all right so from the techboy dorg the
best tech website in the world Windows
11 that's have a built-in um graphing
calculator and the default kly password
so everyone knows the default kly
password now which is kie and kie the
username and password and windows 11 has
built-in graphing calculator so check
out those articles if you haven't um
used them um seen them um and windows 11
uh has a buil a gra graphing calculator
which is pretty uh interesting you can
graph stuff on it without um internet
having to use Desmos or Mathway or
anything like that I found that um
really interesting
um also there's this really interesting
hacking tutorial that says you can get a
shell on
anything where is
it yes you can get a shell on any um PC
here so I'm I'm going to try that right
now let's bring up
our I downloaded a new version of kly
that didn't work unfortunately um well
it worked but it
didn't connect to my adapter like the
drivers and stuff wasn't working but it
probably should work for this so let us
start go away there we go let us start
this
a tutorial from L Lang Yang here we
go in this video I'm going to run you
through what goes into an internal and
external penetration test and how so you
want to be able to remote control any
computers the what we need to learn
today is about reverse shells it is a
super cool way for us to be able to
enter thing next thing we need is a
hacker after this is the one that allow
us the ability to interact with the
computer through a command line so in WD
to print working direct 3 and so on so
far so we are interacting with the
computer through a command line and yes
it makes it look really cool like a
hacker not the problem is that if you
are a hacker on
a shells and everything but we're just
here for the tutorial so your call Linux
IP address as well as the port number
this is an online now the good news is
that this is really easy to create now
now the first thing you can do is go
over into your favorite browser so in
this case I can go over and say Firefox
I run firef Fox right now and I go to
this website called ref shell.com so go
ahead so I'm going to use it on chrome
chrome is my browser of choice
so shells and then we're going to go
share the tab hopefully you can see this
on the screen and this is the tab who's
looking at
okay speaking of IP addresses we have a
lot to talk about that today um there
was this scene from it some odyy that we
got to talk
about all right so I went to the website
and I'm back here an ref shell.com so
this is an online reverse shell
generator that we can easily use to help
us generate those code as well as the
listener in all the for us to remote
control this PCS the first thing you
want to do is to be able to change the
team from light to dark I've already
changed it over into dark so that you
look like a hacker one you want to be
able to set the IP and Port so in this
case the IP address is going to be your
call Linux IP address as well as the
port number to be hosting the listener
number two is the listener instruction
so in this case we have several options
and we will give you the code that gives
you the instruction to set up the
listener of your tipe number three as
you can see right at the bottom half we
have reverse buy Ms of Venom okay so
these are the type of shells that you
can make H shell so all these are
different type of shells that you can
set up and of course depending on the
type of operating system that you want
to Target okay obviously we're going to
Target windows and as you can see on the
screen you can Target all of them which
is just Linux Windows and Mac I'm just
going to say windows for Simplicity sake
oh back to the video yeah such a neat
solution so now in this case what I'll
do is open up terminal and I'll enter
the following of Ip addr to get my IP
address so in this case my IP address is
say full of 1 1821 16801 17 there it is
there it is okay I
see so this is the col Linux IP address
so we have already set the IP address as
well as the target part number the next
thing we can see here is the type so we
have several types that we can use as
part of setting up the listener so in
this case we have msf console which is
going to be using methasit or
interpreter or any other potentially
type of pays or different type of
listeners would set so in this case that
depends on what you set on the bottom
number three so in this case I can say
NC for msf controls is like very popular
here and you just use this tool and copy
and past it in very simple um so if you
want to make shs that's a way that you
can do it all right
also um so this's the scene from Advent
L episode that a today um hopefully the
website's not still down because they
I'm G to play
it but essentially Moy suzu and Emil uh
and Koopa are all trying to track down
this guy who's blackmailing Koopa Calon
okay and he apparently knows where
koop's location is because he um has a
GPS track on his phone right and that
that struck me as weird because it's not
like you can just like type in a phone
number and trace it um if you're not
like the government uh believe me i'
I've tried it's
impossible um so I was wondering like
how could you get a GP and besides even
if you trace the phone by a number
traced off of cell tabls not by a GPS Mo
says that he's tracing it via his
phone's GPS uh system now of course he
could be lying to impress Emily because
as you guys know from our work over on
the boy
blogspot.com uh Mo radio obviously has a
crush on Emily okay he has
uh
uh crush on Emily it's it's obvious this
episode we're talking about the team
right I mean he could be just saying all
this stuff to impress Emily like he's
saying he's creating an algorithm to
spoof a
location uh yeah as he was just typing
on his phone no that that's not how it
works so I figured out this is how he
track traced his location okay he hacked
into his Google or iCloud account we're
going to say Google and here's why
because all those location spoofing
applications on the like you cannot
spoof your location on an iPhone and
it's doubtful that he he would have a
gel book and iPhone or something like
that so he he obviously has an Android
phone right that that's uh key okay so
this guy has an Android phone and Koop
kahun and Mo just downloads a location
sing app that maybe he made himself on
like an App Maker okay um and the way
that they're tracing this location is
that they use Google find my device but
maybe he doesn't check his email that
much and we like how do you get his
password or anything like that he just
like because he sent his sent him a
phone number so we probably know his
email address or something and maybe his
password is exposed in a leak or was
just like really easy to guess like
Cooper one two3 question mark or a
Cooper coun or football or something
like that like something really easy to
guess or maybe just got sent a fishing
email from the guy who was hacking into
the system now later into the episode
they send a USB flash drive into the
computer so that he can fake change is
gr um I was thinking about this and
since uh later in the episode like when
they catch the guy he it's discovered
that he don't know that much about
computers I was thinking like how would
he get the IP of
the computer or
everything like that that was kind of
confusing to me like it's not like I can
just like type in here and go tag any
random computer in the world unless it's
like connected to the internet but then
you could just go to like zoom ioda in
and then find something that's connected
to RDP and Pro Force supports or
whatever
um but it's not like the principal's
computer is just you know connected to
the internet as a like file sh or
something you just connect to it but he
said that the the thing was he sent him
instructions like the hacker guy sent
him instructions on how to change his
grade and stuff and then confirmed to
prove it so I thought that it uh
probably
what more was he set up just like random
Linux virtual machine got some random
online this is key this is key online
like grade software like say rreb or a
power school or something like that and
maybe create like a fake version of that
with like fake grades in it so then that
Cooper could create it and then he just
stuck it in there Cooper booted up you
the virtual machine right and that
virtual machine in addition to having
like the fake grade software on there
that's accessible via the Internet um
also had a team viewer on it or
something
and maybe the guy was like trying to
like team view in or whatever like
remote desktop programs s for Linux
let's let's check that right
there remote
desk VNC connect wom any desk team view
xrdp okay great he had any one of these
wonderful programs on uh here right so
he had these programs on here so he
could RDP into just remote desktop into
this the grade system Cooper changed it
and he was trying to log in but maybe
you just had some problems typing or
something or there was a Wi-Fi
connectivity issue or something but then
here comes the main problem so here's
why web race is important so he opens up
the browser he checks that it's in there
he clicks the website and it gets his
[Music]
IP I think we stumbled on a problem cuz
I think that if I would like team view
in from a phone that get your IP address
well anyway somehow this this Linux box
is like a Honeypot program that gets his
IP address so he can get the
location yeah that I'm still trying to
figure it out the way um yeah so anyway
he's trying to get the location of the
device so then they they track down the
guy and find him in some abandoned chat
or something like something right that's
a problem
like I was thinking maybe C click the
link but I I clicked on grabify right I
made up my own grabify link or something
uh it only got my city which is you know
normal right until I enable like smart
data and GPS logging but if you're
checking in for my laptop then GPS
loging wouldn't make sense or work and I
was thinking maybe he got his Wi-Fi
network because uh as you guys know with
wiggle Wi-Fi you can uh identify the
location of a building just by the SSID
uh as long as it's been um more drove U
my theory is that somehow Mo set up a
Honeypot to get all the IPS accessing it
in there and since odysse is such a
small town or something that they're
able to trace it besides it said he was
in an abandoned shopping strip right and
I looked up like really
Advanced uh IP tracing programs right
they got like everything and it was able
to get within my neighborhood or
something like that it says like 15
minutes away or something like that um
and it changeed depending on if I was
using my cular IP like mobile data um
which is using like the sales hours or
like my IP it's connected to the
internet through via Wi-Fi um so that
changes of
course but I mean it wasn't it was too
large of an area to like say oh it's a
shopping center I using like a really
big shopping center like maybe say like
the mall but even that's even that's uh
pretty small comparatively for an IP
address um you now if you was hacking in
to it from his phone that would make a
lot more sense because maybe just
consented to giving his GPS location or
something like that or of course Mo Rell
was just lying this whole time and he
knew the guy and he knew where he was
something like that but we'd have to
find out about that or Mo R um secretly
as the program was running he got the
guy's phone number sent him a link or
something like that and then he can send
it to his GPS location or something like
that um so yeah also one last thing uh
so Mo Emily suzu and Koop all talking to
each other on these like ear pieces and
headsets and stuff like that and it's
like they're on a four-way call but over
a walkie-talkie Ando is able to mute the
audio and the walkie talkie I'm not sure
you can do that but whatever um so yeah
that's that's very interesting uh Evy
episode right there and speaking of
Advent and odyssey we got to talk about
the lane and the episode that started Co
it is got to be the most annoying
literally the most annoying episode on
the planet okay let me let me set you up
here so in D Lane there is I think I can
pull it
up uh I wonder what I wonder if Beyond
gillot did an episode of this not beond
gillot Beyond gillot podcast something
let's see
down I promise you we will get to Tech
topics but this is this is important oh
yes return to Gilead the return to
Gilead podcast Sunrise upset okay as you
can see here this is season 4 episode
since so nearly season five okay okay
last time this episode aired was around
this time preco okay so this like four
years ago when I was still in eighth
grade okay and this when I first heard
this episode I was so mad okay they have
been putting together this entire Saga
of the victors and Grace and everybody
um together like this is whole thing
that's going around Gad okay now to put
this in perspective okay Down Gilead
Lane has been around or not been around
was aing has 12 Seasons right this is
the fourth season so this Saga has
literally been going on for a third of
the Season not third season third of the
ear right so
lital do we use real time well no no
because they just started redoing this
when I was interviewed on keys for kids
and I was interviewed on keys for kids
like October and then they finished that
and then
and yeah so this has been going on for
like a year okay it takes about yeah
probably takes about three years to
finish djl because Odyssey it takes
about three and a half years to finish
that three AOS every day except for
Saturdays because those are the like new
episodes end in Sundays they on Saturday
but DJ they only a once a week of a new
episode yeah so they that right there's
like 12 episodes in album so in Four
Seasons I in a season so Four Seasons 48
episodes that's year right so they
basically started this whole soccer
thing that's been wov and draw all 48
episodes well eight minus two like 46
episodes
plus like bonus Christmas special
whatever
but okay they've been doing this for an
entire year okay and they get to this
episode here Sunrise upset season 4
episode 10 and they're going to a
grown-ups only lunch meeting no kids
arive it's curiosity was Micha in their
parents meeting when they go out for a
Bo or michaelin op eliminated get the
best or parents stay away from the big
meing at the Sunrise girl after all my
mom and dad never said they couldn't go
anywhere okay so before we get into
theity ethics up this episode I'm I'm
going to say like from a listeners
perspective you okay you've been you
have been in the ad meetings in
operation lemonade right you have been
the
people going out and in doing the stuff
and investigating right so you as a
listener are basically sitting in on the
ad meetings you want to know more right
so you as a listener could kill ass of
what Brooke and Caleb and all these
people uh Michael are doing is moral
right second of
all you are sitting there for 30
minutes okay 25 minutes whatever
listening like as they when they sit
into the booth behind their parents
because there's no one else to say
that's explicitly given in the episode
it's not like they chose to sit there
right it's not like they had that much
food to eat at home anyway um which
those are the excuses they give in the
episode I'm not I'm not going to defend
them okay last time we did that we ended
up controversial uh
but
like just give benefit out they sit
there right and they are listening to
hear this information all imagine you
The Listener are also sitting there in
the in the booth right you The Listener
are sitting there in the booth right you
you're here eager to hear information
right you've been on this Saga for an
entire year maybe even when it
originally AED maybe even more years I'm
not sure how they did it um back then
like in 2000 okay like think about it I
like to use this analogy here you I
think I've used this before you are like
one oh yeah I used this when I was
talking about episode 167 of EV Odyssey
and how it shouldn't even be Canon
because it's uh the uh it's the episode
where someone L time travels back from
odys no not time travels travels through
time and space from Odyssey into
uh into the real world focused on the
family headquarters right
here here's what I say imagine
Christian's family remember Christian
the like the home school conservative
girl from advin ly right with like 17
siblings or something like that imagine
Christian's family listening to episod
1995 all who listens to an audio drama
wakes up early in the morning the milk
the cows like I say it's 1995 so there's
no like internet to listen to see right
uh wakes up the morning to milk the cows
at 9:30 and goes to radio to listen to
the broadcast in heres of full 30 minute
ad for a television show Odyssey now
imagine it's like 2002 right imagine
it's 2002 you wake up right and you hear
this entire episode where about to
finally give you the key bit of
information that you have been literally
waiting for for years a year right okay
this has been going on for third of this
so right so uh in Odyssey terms that
means this has been going on for like 13
years okay um imagine like the mo by Del
Saga and then right when they I take
give the key piece of evidence when
about to link mrck to everything uh
that's been going around on around the
town they get a conscience and they get
up and
stand and then tell their parents which
sure right thing to do but imagine you
to listen to you just wasted 30 minutes
of your time listening to this and then
you don't even get any answers because
they I mean that's kind of annoying
don't you think like
it's annoying like like maybe like if it
was if this was real life then yes
obviously they probably did the right
thing you can debate that whatever this
is not a debate
well well I
mean it it's kind of a debate show
whatever
um but imagine you get up in from Mil
calls and you just hear this like I'd be
so
annoyed I I would be very
annoyed but also let's say this is real
life why didn't they just do other stuff
like order and get it to go I'm pretty
sure Sunrise girl does
that it's just one of the most
like I mean they literally bugged
Grace's house with a
cup and we didn't get information from
that okay I mean we we at some point we
got to get information somehow I mean we
we can't just sit here and listen
to kind of sort of Secrets because we've
been on this mystery for Lal Years
anyway we got more things to talk about
there was just one of the more annoying
episodes that I've heard about and yes
they do have a podcast episode that I
gotta listen to later I'm pretty sure
that they want me to
listen uh
to doing that
all right now it's time for our mat pet
segment no no no we can do that we got
Mr mobile to talk about we got uh
OnePlus the
one okay we got a M mobile ad
here mint Mobile's legal team if big
wireless companies are allowed sponsored
by incog striking out and the OnePlus
Watch 2 is such an improvement over the
original that I'd have forgiven the
company for dropping the two from the
name entirely pretending gen one here we
go practically everything this is a oh
yeah it's a watch with an actual
operating system without a real time op
breing system from three years ago duh
handsome if beastly Beauty it's 47 mm
case size and needed counter to the two
small pixel watch and a sensible
contemporary to Samsung's similarly
sized Galaxy watch 6 classic interesting
but as you can see here looks like the
bezels of this watch are a lot thicker
so I'm not sure how that really
translates to screen
size so maybe it's just an optical
illusion because you see I have this
bzel here have the bzel though that bzel
is actually useful turns so that case is
stainless steel rated ip68 for dust and
water resistance and tested under 16
subcategories of the mil standard 810h
regiment it's circular plantform set off
by a flat flourish that adds two pushers
and some intentional asymmetry that I
like a lot OnePlus says the design was
inspired by vintage automobiles I'm not
sure how it's inspired by vintage
automobiles like okay that's a tire
right there stopwatches and I really
think the whole vibe just
works keep in mind that I prefer big
watches my normal daily driver is a
mammoth Mark captain at least until
Garmin takes its review sample back and
so the OnePlus will likely be too big
think that is like $2,000 I think but I
concur with Joe Maring over at DT the
watch wears its 80 GS quite lightly on
the wrist and yes you can swap out I
wonder how maybe like even weight
distribution strer bands stock straps
for any 22mm watch band you
like Power It Up and the pluses continue
on the AMOLED watch face neither the 1.4
in diameter nor the 326 PPI pixel
density are particularly special but
colors pop brightly under the sapphire
crystal cover and the platform producing
those colors is the bigger news the full
fat version of we OS 4 complete with
Google assistant ever since Google
effectively rebooted its where so that's
good it'd be kind of funny if they
brought Gemini to the watch before they
brought it to the pixel be kind of
annoying for Pixel fans terrible
platform in 2021 we've been waiting for
momentum to return to the long stagnant
were OS and oneplus's entry into the
space is well timed as an effective
counter to the unfortunate exit of
fossil group I didn't know about this
until I saw this video for the first
time so I'm going to check that out
let's see what happened
to fil
watches they are leaving the Smartwatch
business but they're going to make
traditional
watches they lost 90% of their market
value dang I leave too
and this isn't just new hardware with
the same old software it's the first
watch running the new I kind of wanted a
fossil uh Smartwatch I like them and you
could find them like places dual
architecture edition of
were alongside the Snapdragon W5 chipset
that handles the heavy lifting OnePlus
added a secondary co-processor I'm
pretty sure they know a lot about aio's
take care of the simpler stuff no to be
clear that's nothing new co-processors
are common in wearables and this
particular model the Bez 2700 is in fact
already on the
market used in this exact same
configuration in the Oppo watch 4 Pro
they are sister company so what's
different here is that Google has
rebuilt we OS so it takes better
advantage of that dual chip setup so
it's not just simple stuff like watch
faces that save power you can receive
notifications dismiss them even quick
reply to them with
just reading this response to a
comment without that high power
Snapdragon W5 ever needing to spin
up the place that pays off most
prominently is of course power
consumption OnePlus made the expected
exaggerated battery life claims but as
you know I don't play that game I just
don't see much use in shoving a
smartwatch into a power saving mode to
max out its uptime where I mean I do
that at least for most of the time uh oh
wait you can't even see this thing oh my
gosh there we goas I do see a lot of
utility and a wearable that lets me use
any watch face I want well I'm going to
go back to bring up the visuals let's
see
you to see this one
visual well contemporary here we go I
was talking about the bezels on the
watch see this black one looks smaller
than the black bzel here but I'm not
sure how big the bezel the silver and
the black are
combined well it still lasted me over 75
hours 3 days of hard usage with sleep
tracking and lots of notifications not
too shabby when it and of course with
always on display on cuz he believes
that watches should always show you the
time no matter if you're looking at them
comes to where OS and with a USB
connector that accommodates any type-c
cable the magnetic fast charger is a win
too I wonder what would happen if I put
an OMG cable into that
thing probably the first person to think
that you know what I'm also probably one
of the first people to think about I
think about cool like the geopolitical
relationships in them ins uh probably
more in one day that most people do in
one
year but despite its name the Watch 2 is
a first generation product which means
it leaves room for improvement in health
tracking basic interface elements and
its phone
app is he us going on the OnePlus fold
what's wrong with the app looks pretty
good to me the reasons I'll be going
back to and Google after
this interesting to note here he uses
the spons in cogy to like delete him
from the internet but I wonder what ever
happened to delete me those of you who
watched my recent retrospective on the
palm Prix that was a pretty good video
recall that phone's inspired gesture
area meant to keep your filthy fingers
from fudging up your screen and the
equivalent on a smartwatch is what
Google used to call the rotating side
button aka the digital
Crown well this I guess is an analog do
you think we should add something like
that back to phones like I know the
Blackberry had one with the touch ball
touchpad uh laptops have them uh with
their touch pads he has the touchcreen
um and Samsung you could like move your
phone with your eye or something like
that with your head um scream with your
head we talked about that in last week's
video um with ink we getting the Galaxy
S4 um
what do you think I think it'd be nice
to have like
handsfree navigation oh and uh pixel 4
you know they experiments or gestures
for a while a crown by which I mean it
physically rotates but does nothing you
can't scroll lists or messages you can't
zoom in on a map you can just fuss with
it which of course begs the question why
does it spin at all well I asked one
plus about that and the company said you
think they just ran out of stuff to do
like uh they they wanted to keep the
price down so they couldn't put the
mechanisms in there or something or
maybe they wanted to Big a battery and
nice product placement here you got your
clicks iPhone a component that rotates
is more durable than one that's rigid
which I simply don't
believe I
mean it depends on how it falls
but yeah is that epip pie no that must
be the one press I think if you bust it
open this watch you might might find a
sensor that indicates that OnePlus
wanted this to be a proper digital Crown
but something stood in the way yes
that's speculation on my part and I'm
not in the habit of busting open review
devices so uh hey Zach you want
to anyway if you don't care about
digital crowns more power to you and
you're smudged up screen well speaking
of Tik Tok it could get banned soon let
me see t i t which is be kind of funny
what's next Stanley Cups those get
banned
okay um let's see can Congress actually
ban Tik Tok yes they can wait Vox I
thought you were out of business why are
you writing
articles I think I saw an article saying
that saying that
um Tik Tock was
uh what what's it
called uh 48% of adults who have Tik Tok
don't post videos and like I was like
really Instagram over Tik toac is Ws
downloaded
app
congratulations it's a win for
America
uh yeah which also if they get banned in
United States I mean it's not going to
do anything if Tik Tok would have get
banned in the United States all that
would happen would be like people
importing EU iPhones so they can
download them from alternative app
stores probably to a surge of uh Android
sales because you could obviously just
sideo Tik Tok many random St on the
internet and Samsung also pre-installs
them on their phones and the Galaxy
store is not an American App Store so
they could be like oh it's exclusive the
only place where you can get fortnite
and Tik Tok and then there's also um
probably a sege of VPN Sals as everyone
manages to get around it in fact uh it's
probably a hot take out here but Banning
Tik Tok would probably lead to more data
collection um than leaving Tik Tock
behind if you think about it like bite
dance knows that they might get banned
unless they have lobbyists here in the
United States which will keep them from
getting banned whatever but let's just
assume that uh Tik Tok gets banned by
Congress on all devices and Apple and
Google immediately have to take them
down from their stores right what
happens well first of all there's going
to be an increase in malware attacks
against Android devices and more people
are going to buy Android devices U as
tiktock apps are then packaged with like
fake like Mal there which will which is
gonna be even easier to get that because
like Mal you don't have to like consent
to you know stuff and it can take
anything and stay like embedded in your
device like Tik Tok love ha it it's not
a piece of mware it's more like spyware
but you can EAS like delete it whatever
okay second of all who okay let's say a
Chinese government you know you're
monitoring bite dance like okay the
Americans might ban our super spy weapon
that we've had embedded in over half
half of Americans devices since 2016
right uh what are we gonna do well if I
was bite dance I'd be like he was bite
VPN okay and I'd say okay here we go
let's make bite VPN it's a
VPN um you put it on your device and of
course gets accepted to the Play Store
maybe not the App Store but maybe they
might uh Safari look around for it or
something like that so bite VPN and they
they make the VPN and then
suddenly uh hey maybe even spoof your
location like myy did and boom you can
download the app obviously from APK
store on Android and maybe for
iPhone yeah you might have to use the
website like someone at school does
um which if you're watching hi right
this zero counters to whatever
um yeah so bite VPN right you download
the app and obviously so you get b v so
you can get Tik Tok it's a free VPN
because they St all your web browsing
data in everything because like every
web every piece of web traffic goes
through there including text like IM
message text or by internet right and
they go through there and say maybe
encrypted or whatever right but
like I
mean the encryption is probably good
enough to fight off like random kids
with Wi-Fi antennas who are trying to
hack into their friend's phone obviously
never have done that before never okay
uh or maybe like random like police
people from like like with the gr Keys
devices and stuff like that right
which wouldn't really matter because the
stuff is all St device but I digress I'm
pretty sure the encryption is not going
to stop uh random not random like a
dedicated nation state of China like
putting stuff on here right first of all
laws don't apply second of all I mean
who's to say that bite VPN and Tik Tok
and um these these devices are not going
to use the collective power of your
devices say say use let's say B VPN and
Tik Tok each us just 1% of your little
uh phone 150 million
um uh what's it called processing power
um let's just pick a random chip let's
say on the Apple side we'll say the
A14 and then the Google side let's
say let's see what chips into a55 a55
chip not out yet but I think it's going
to come out
soon so I'll pick a54 cuz the a55 is
going to come out apparently the a55 is
going to have a new volume
thing let's see the a54 has an xnos 1380
chipset so xus 1380 we just put that
into
versus Snapdragon 788 whatever okay so
this is going to tell us the processing
power of the xnos
1880 um let's see here G8
see 2.4
gahz five watch
whatever um yeah so let's say you just
take a percentage of this and and and
you use it you could easily crack
someone's iMessage encryption with that
right oh guys can't even see this yeah
so let to say you take a percentage of
these chips here these are just basic
chips right take take a percentage of
the xos 1380 or a 77 HG iPhone Apple 14
I uh A14 right if you B VPN you can easy
crack to anyone's encryption there right
and no one would notice right and you
could even um
hide those traffic spikes through with
your VPN or whatever might just be like
a tiny scent more in the phone bill that
no one would notice right um
also
the the
um and AR that dat would be going
through there all that stuff could be uh
decrypted by the Chinese government so
honestly if you think about it Banning
Tik Tok will probably lead to a more
increase in data collection because it's
not like they're going to ban Tik Tok on
which it's illegal for you to have the
app I mean that would be
crazy I me that that would be crazy
could you imagine the the the crime
reports me literally every teenager in
America would be in jail um by next
Tuesday if if say we um banned the Tik
Tok um and made it a crime for you to be
imp possession of it which I'm not even
sure if that's
constitutional I think like I'm pretty
sure you can ban certain
softwares because they're like just
inherently illegal like nucle bombs it's
not like you can I'm just you know
playing with them in my
backyard uh I just wanted to see what
this would your entire neighborhood is
inated uh yeah so I I'm not even sure if
you can ban a specific piece of software
for you to have but I'm pretty sure you
can b a specific software for a coration
to use or say you can't use our servers
or anything like that like a sanction
which thatd be all for but honestly we
going to look out for bite
VPN and bite VPN sponsorships be kind of
funny and think about all the VPN
sponsorships that are are going to go up
it's probably going to boost the economy
too be
like uh here in America the land of the
free and the home of the brave Tik Tok
is Bann
so that's why I use Sur shock so I can
find my mindless content wherever I am
use code tech booy for 20% off if first
purchase' kind of
funny but you need to know about the
other big compromise oh
Health oh oh oh you know what I'm
talking about
oh what the heck what was
that yeah it's actually the official app
for the watch despite the Play Store
crediting the app maker Bravo unicorn
pte which creates among other
illustrious titles the official games
app on some Oppo and realme that's the
only icon that looks professional the
rest of the stuff looks like bunch of
stuff for kids as someone who does not
give half an egg tart about Fitness
features even I found the health
tracking wanting egg tart half an egg
tart nearly every one of my fellow
reviewers noted vast dispar and step and
sleep wait they lost to the whoop van um
band oh my gosh I think the whoop van
just like that thing that shocks you if
you AR exercising or something like that
tracking when comparing the Watch 2
against other Fitness wearables imagine
losing to like a shock machine what's
worse OnePlus says there won't be a
backup feature for your health data
until the end of March so if you need to
switch phones before then your day okay
I mean who's going to be switching
phones in like
20 days I'm I'm sure you can wait right
it's not like people just g go there and
buy a one place watch be like I I need a
new phone within 20 days and if the
health that is inaccurate like who cares
data doesn't follow you ad ditto if you
need to switch which phone your watch is
connected to you got to factory reset it
so okay that's bad but again that's kind
of a tech with you of problem not a
normal person like okay I mean this guy
literally uses a Galaxy fold
on like weekdays and a Galaxy flip on
weekends not to mention like other the
phones he's just like testing testing
around like an iPhone video and stuff
like that most people they carry one or
two
phones something were OS 3 solved long
time
ago sadly a similar compromise pervades
the collection of compatible watch faces
these aren't ugly so much as uninspired
which normally wouldn't be worth
mentioning because on WE OS I just tend
to use faer but in order to leverage the
power Savings of this new architecture
watch faces need to be built in Google's
watch face format and that right now
limits your selection to something like
80 compatible faces that's kind of bad
but it's not like
a terrible thing bummer that kind of
makes sense since like facer is an
external application and it' be kind of
hard on the Ros to run that external
application um
continuously fortunately OnePlus still
does know how to price at 299 this
undercuts both Google's pixel watch and
Samsung's Galaxy watch 6 classic and
that's not even counting the trade-in
program that can net you up to a couple
hundred bucks off depending on what
you're giving back wait a second I want
to see if you could trade in a phone
wait aund a couple hundred at that point
they're giving it to you for free let's
see one plus
watch
two want to see I can trade in let check
this
out it would be kind of funny if someone
traded in like a really expensive phone
for this
watch here go here you go send in your
old device and get up to
500
it's not the is this the McLaren edition
of the phone who don't Earth to be
trading that in for 10t how old is this
website oh my
gosh okay here we
go wait you can trade it in
huwei wait you can trade in any watch
even if it's not a smartwatch it's kind
of smart uh besides you you won't even
have to
uh won't even have to reset
it let's see I wonder if I can trade in
my amaz FIT watch in my spy watch do you
think they'll take that some random
watch
60.0 skip the
addons okay here we go here we
go
where's my trade in it's not letting me
trade
in that's unfortunate oh well too uh too
bad for you one plus I'm not going to
look around for
that wait you can trade in the Apple
watch Ultra
titanium for 280 are you crazy and I
like this even if all you've got is an
old dumb watch OnePlus will still give
you bucks off if you order by the end of
March okay that's good from the low end
let's trash from the high end so saying
do Apple watch
Ultra wait was that that's the original
Ultra that thing retail for like $700
let's see Apple watch
Ultra let's check
eBay for the prices kind of sad that the
RO depreciated 50%
W uh but that's still a bad deal I mean
you can probably find it yeah look at
this
725 619
5.99$ 799 I'm like we're we still in
phone territory right here okay so uh
one plus is literally undercutting you
by
about no 75% what a scam still you got
to keep in mind what else is is out
there for were OS while I prefer the
look of the OnePlus over the mob boy
tick watch Pro 5 that watch got me an
unprecedented 5 days of battery life and
it's currently on sale for Less with a
working digital Crown to boot if you
don't trust mob boy to keep your
software current that's fair enough the
non-classic version of Samsung's watch 6
comes in for Less two with a much more
robust and reliable Health platform to
back it up with competition like that
and rumors of a bigger pixel watch
coming when Google refreshes the lineup
later in the year well while it's nice
to see OnePlus try trying again and by
no means do I want it to quit the Watch
2 is not quite enough to match the
smartphone successes that have
rightfully had OnePlus back in the
headline I wonder if they're using the
same whim for this for watch
recently
that's interesting uh take by Mr mobile
do you know what's not an interesting
take this here we go
uh what is it film Theory okay film
theory is about to get ripped no
Watchers right now
interesting play War Thunder now join
millions of players across the globe
watch this whole thing it's like 20
minutes long but
mean let's watch watch this oh let's go
to like the entire the entirety of the
terrible takes in this episode okay so I
was thinking okay uh let's see the here
we go feels so
important great good father figures from
children's media I'm talking okay so
that's that's a good that's a good point
right um it's been made before I'm
pretty sure focus on the family made it
uh and they plugged in reviews or they
they
what they call Daily Citizen articles I
was like okay okay that's great that's
great it's a good take nice way to end
it off right so from 1:34 to like 4:25
we would gra I was like yes it's a great
take it's a great take and then this
happened into their life according to
research most kids don't start to
identify with one gender or another
until the age of three and it's
important that they're encouraged to
explore that at their own pace the heck
does that mean what explore that you are
what you are the last thing we want to
do is to sort kids who are still
discovering themselves into boxes no I I
think we should do that you know that'
be a great thing for society and
likewise children can of course have
role models who are not the same sex or
gender that they are that's kind of
redundant it's the same thing it is
awesome for boys to have role models who
are women vice versa and everyone Beyond
an in there's no such thing it's no such
thing okay so he already stuck with that
but then for the entire video and this
is made to me um by someone online he he
he didn't like stick some into boxes
because there's obviously no studies
made by Lego in 2011 for non-existent
madeup
stuff emulates at a quick glance the
modern era it's seen a wide spectrum of
overwhelmingly positive affirming female
and female coded characters what is a
female coded character everything from
Doc McStuffins to the miraculous ladybug
Hello Kitty Bluey L from the I never
knew that Bluey was a girl until like ow
house most of the gems from Steven
Universe Carmen San Diego who's
apparently a hero now Barbie just had
herself an yeah okay and then then he
brings up this point which makes me
think about the DGL episode he's
completely wrong here oil narcissist
jimy arrogant destructive mean to girls
and regularly uses his intelligence as
excuse for being a jerk to his friends
even Phineas and Ferb who are smart and
resourceful and funny are outright
disobeying their parents no they're not
no they're not okay uh in the F and
universe their parents don't know what
they're doing okay they they they never
know okay they cannot disobey their
parents like their parents never told
them don't build a roller coaster now
they could be disting like government
codes and regulations and all sorts of
safety stuff but if that doesn't exist
in this world they're not breaking any
rules each and every day of summer
actually the reason Ali wanted to stop
watching the show he was afraid of them
getting in trouble for constantly
breaking the rules what rule the only
person who's mad at them was uh Candence
Cadence Candice episode after episode I
think you get the idea look at media
through this sort of lens and suddenly
you see examples everywhere you go just
to get some hard numbers in here that
same Gina Davis study that I mentioned
earlier noted that male characters
they're more likely to be violent
compared to female characters and also
almost twice as likely to be depicted as
a criminal remember we're not talking
about fun characters to watch or
characters that you yeah well I mean
that's the overall of theist just of
theist no absolutely not I don't know
what he's talking about like he SED the
good premise but then he's just suchar
going off track
nope um then I haven't seen this one so
let's react to
this oh and apparently there's save
website where you can keep up with him
um because apparently X is not good
enough that's
[Music]
basically oh my
gosh guys and welcome to GT not live
where today you know just a normal
typical day here at theor stink not
really though no it's far from it uh it

Pat's Legacy oh my gosh like the guy
died on the official YouTube this is a
40 million subscribers I know it's on a
40 million subscriber channel it's kind
of low for a 40 million subscriber

YouTube
so be kind of funny if YouTube channel
got hacked yeah man okay here we go
let's try it did did you hold up I tried
clicking on it then so since it didn't

[Music]
thumbnail no no no because I cuz I got
to say thumbnail pretty pretty solid by
YouTube standards I was given I was
given two options for this thumbnail
this is the one I chose I can't say that
I put any input into that would be
unfair she knew about the she knew about
the video statement fair enough awesome
but I did pick this one as oppos we
didn't there was an AB test sent to me I
chose between the A and the B okay
sounds good all right's okay I'll click
on it I'm I'm nervous my gosh hello
retirement that's Legacy on YouTube wow
okay going us for a heartfelt farewell
to our you want to know you want to know
where the information kind of think he's
going to come back I kind of think he's
going to come back
digging going it going
to is it this pleas play my goodness you
don't have all day for this podcast
hello Internet welcome to Game Theory
you are an absolute Legend so much
passion for what he does he's the big
brother I've never had my brother from
another mother he's a movie
star I have no idea who these people are
thanks Tommy
I got I got a couple seconds in a movie
movie YouTube Red this must be like 2015
let's see if we use a unique phone
identifying software and upload up the
quality to uh
1080p all right let's okay I'll click on
I'm I'm nervous hello retirement my
arrow key is broken I have like five
broken Keys our heartfelt fwell to you
want to know you want to know where the
information is digging
you know B what's this S5 S6 S Note four
so maybe like 2014 2015 walked he does
not care about your legacy it doesn't
seem no
clear the Judgment over my legacy is
happening real time there that's funny
oh man well this was also before there
was Legacy right this
is
uh didn't he create a phone no never
mind you we did no no he has a pixel he
has a pixel yeah it's just a leg six
years ago seven years ago it's crazy how
long ago we did game lab that's nuts I
know seven years ago 24 244
2017 you're 12 seconds in man hold up
well yeah
but Ash and Stephanie as people who know
what this is yes presumably uhuh should
I do this like a normal GT live and like
actually like stop and theorize and
pontificate as we go or should I just
consume it
I could see it both ways I think I think
you should watch it all the way through
and then I think you should go back and
GT live I think it's a six minute and 21
I've never just seen a GT live for
second video I think you can sit and
watch it maybe YouTube will claim us
though I don't think so
okay I may have I've already had some
talk that'd be kind of funny really of
course oh that's awesome okay here let's
let's go well now since I paused I want
to go back okay hello Internet welcome

Legend so much passion for what he does
he's the big brother who is it who are
you I've never had my brother from
another mother he's a movie
star chat we have breaking news today

hey it's me I'm here too as the channels
grew up been here the whole
time you're like Sam R you've been here
the whole time who okay we also grew up
somewhere along the lines and I've been
so proud of every Milestone that we've
seen you do this over and over again
Stephanie you do these things where all
of a sudden you're just like why does he
look like I've been working on a secret
video in the background gotcha rug
pull don't don't look at me it's all of
the network of spies that I have around
me to help about with it there were
there were all kinds of people involved
here you don't think I know what's going
on in my own building I'm getting
pinpointed I don't know I think I make a
theory saying that all the theory
channels are linked so I think I could
prove that
easily I going
on a lot
okay okay grew up somewhere along the
lines and I've been so proud of every
Milestone that we've seen along the way
we just passed a million wait he passed
a million subscribers after a year oh my
gosh that means I've actually slowed
down in subscriber count you know no
they actually stayed steady I think
subscribers we finally joined the elite
million plus Club I like I like the fact
that they didn't cut to the live stream
of us crossing the million subscribers
where the the chat decided to troll us
and unsubscribe
just as we're about to cross a million
and that was uh that was the internet
and
nut I think they did that to um what's
his name Pleasant Green in his live
stream hello Internet welcome wait film
theor been around since
2014 to film theorists it's like film
school but edgier funnier and a whole
lot cheaper it's 10 years old uh to be
fair
definitely overestimated ourselves on
that one right yeah it was not it was
not film school is actually different
than film Theory definitely not funnier
either let's be honest like calling
anything that we've created funny is is
a thing he's very funny he's like a
conspiracy do that's been accepted by
the media there's a there's a smiling in
the cringe though you see you told me to
watch this all the way through but you
can't take the GT live reaction out of
the man because I feel like I have to do
it I also love that they made a logo out
of the theorist logo for the the World
Conference I know the detail oriented
the detail orientedness is very
impressive I I Matt Matthew Patrick did
we edit this did our team edit this no
is this YouTube no wait he met Pope
Francis that can't be
true a
Christian oh he just met a bunch of
random
YouTubers
oh he h
okay no way YouTube did this entirely
entirely for
you they volunteered out of the blue
yeah out of the total goodness of their
hearts and respect for the time that you
spent on the platform to do this compl
completely on their own for you that's
awesome they're pretty good people
that's awesome shout out to Jake uh well
the reason I call it out is is not
because YouTube's editing is bad but
more so because YouTube's no which
because it is not uh if it had been our
team he'd been like well yeah Tyler
could have tightened up this no no the
the reason I was G to call it out is
because this looks like a Tyler edit and
I'm like and because Tyler is incredible
and Tyler's awesome and I look at this
and I'm like this so closely mimic and
matches like the Aesthetics and style
that that Tyler would do through the
lens of YouTube in a lot of way like
it's very good marriage of the Styles
and I'm just sitting here appreciating
that anyway that's me and my buddy
Francis that bud this is this is a right
this his reaction when I gave him under
tale yeah yeah like here you go Pope
he's like he that was his that was his
reaction to that moment yep educate our
viewers by talking about video games I'm
where's the game lab oh man
gameb million it's
[Music]
crazy iidea
guy 40 plus million subscribers oh food
launching that's why they have all the
like
mask I'm keeping them running no matter
how crazy things got matat still found
time to have fun with his
friends
I de losing a chance of winning a
million dollar and now that Matt's
retiring I don't think I'll ever get a
chance for that rematch oh I will
rematch Bing but in real life that's the
thing YouTuber bowling that is an
untapped Market I like I don't know why
lwig jumped from like YouTuber boxing to
chess boxing or like dodgeball bowling I
feel like is Market here yeah you don't
need really much you know athletic
ability to get going to just get the
ball down the lane anyone can
participate in that I would love the
memes of B what am I doing with the
fashion show we should be doing YouTuber
bowling
tournaments we'll put that on the
private we're talking about what we're
doing after the fashion show WR down
YouTuber bowling tournament that is it
be the latest game of bowling you've
ever seen dude that would be amazing
kidding the trash talk people would
watch YouTuber bowling and and the trash
talk at time the trash talk would be
great the gutter balls would be all over
how' you get a gutter ball I don't even
see a gutter buers but that's fine buers
you would have to have like a
bumper maybe you could add in some like
like some um can you imagine the shoes
the drip it would be amazing oh that's
great okay YouTuber bowling we're going
to make it happen oh it's close it's
close that was proud that was that was
clutch sometimes he
sings what what quite a
s this is a crime scene sometimes he
stabs me with a chainsaw frequently do
actually in an upcoming video what are
they talking about oh I I I get to stab
myself with that exact same chainsaw
it's great YouTube will totally fine
with that GL they got a lot of
efficiency out of the use of the that's
awesome oh totally right this this
doesn't pass this doesn't pass it was a
different it was it was a different I'm
saying but they put it up
today sometimes we end
picture of us stabs me with a
chainsaw sometimes who are you are you a
cooking
show to actually bake I just want to
keep dancing when I'm hanging out with
you those shoots with row took so long
they took so long they all day what that
what
did videos did you guys shoot like like
five and you'd be like no two got like
one one and a half we got we had to rush
through the second one no for like a 15
minute baking video or what so we
noticed at least 2017 ended up being
like a four hour shoot for each one it
was
crazy I am always thankful that you gave
me the opportunity to play your rocket
League IRL we like a WiFi signal right
now but we put him in a wig and I convin
and meat grasshoppers we had the
how many collabs has this guy done with
random people I've never heard
of to be fair the Grasshoppers were the
the the least extreme option on that day
what is this the loop
show for those who don't know the loop
show is like a Christian show where if
you like mess up something then you eat
something weird cat food there was uh
there was breast milk oh yeah that was
on there Ash behind the camera has
literally lit up and is traumatized now
hello
yes and I'm like there's no world where
I'm comfortable toing yeah it was like
you could either eat a steak that was up
in our ceiling Rafters or drink this
breast milk like you know what guys
going to go with the steak that's dirty
and covered with feathers thank you very
much that was the obvious choice put him
in a wig and I convin to meet
grasshoppers I'm I'm shocked for as much
as we've done with red and Link and or
like as much as we know them and like
passed through the same circles and
stuff that like we've only
truly done this and then like one of the
charity live streams like there I know
no no they they've been awesome at
coming on our charity live streams
impact on my channel once that video
dropped I hit a million subscribers and
within all five
days
good who are these people are these nfcs
man such a great song when working with
stupendium I knew that that was going to
be a finale song like even even in the
comments you could see people being like
oh wow this is such a good culmination
of the Channel's history and then they
pulled off the streamy awards which was
unbelievable oh my gosh and then pulled
off stream award wild like so fast it
was crazy had incc wos I thinkc did but
I knew that it would be like I knew that
that was like a culminating moment like
it was science Blaster like 2.0 or like
a like a good sendoff song for the whole
thing and that's why you know it we
reuse it as a part of the final Theory
too which is was important to
[Music]
me what song is
that gotta love how Matt pad always
brought others along for the ride with
them I remember freaking out because I
got that notification that said Matt Pat
reacted to my video just seeing myself
and I've done be taken as seriously by
the M pack was so much the M pack could
you kill someone with a potato yeah
being taken so seriously so seriously
right I think I think what was it at
that was great that was that was that
was a really fun what was at that point
like you fire a potato out for fast
enough Cannon and hit it out the vital
organ yeah you could kill someone with a
potato like the S&P I I knew the the
number of deaths that everyone had had
better than most of the people who were
on the S&P at that point or something
like that where everyone's like they had
to rewrite the wiki and rewrite the lore
a little bit because they're like oh
yeah I guess that did count as a death
like well sorry
let me throw that one off I worked the
S&P like the S&P 500 was that a video
game with them for about three years I
was just the history guy and the editor
I started making Roblox piggy Theory
videos and the idea was maybe I can be a
little bit like
matat didn't just I made a the video too
better show up on here other creators he
also paid it forward to communities
outside of YouTu we are here today to
benefit St Jude Children's Research
Hospital Matt Pat has always been a
leader and taking advantage of the
platform and actually man imagine
donating $60 and you end up on YouTube
but then you get blew it out it's head
being back when Matt came on for thankas
he showed up and he had so much energy
and I love you too in a plutonic way
many people maybe a little too much
energy I think I think Sean was a little
bit surprised by like came out really
EXC overwhelming an overwhelming amount
of energy little flood little flood gate
of energy are now if it weren't for you
your generosity $3
[Applause]
million at this point I think I'm kind
of evolving into a grandpa Pat from Matt
Pat to grandpa Pat well we've got some
theories of our own it's the start of an
Epic Quest not a goodbye I definitely
don't think they're going to sort of
ride off into the sunset he's going to
