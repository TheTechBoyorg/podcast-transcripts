<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 32324 I have to stand with Apple AGAIN</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to the this
week in the tech boy uh podcast hello
and welcome to the tech boy This Week in
Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody we have lots to
talk about today okay we have the Apple
first is the doj thing that's come up in
Tech news we have our road to s24 ultra
thing coming up and yeah we can talk
about the advertising we received on the
tech boy and our digital AI influencer
Ava Haru so here we go here's Ava
hopefully you can see her on the
screen
TDA we started it last week and7 posts
we now have 169 followers which means
we're g to have 200 uh followers very
very
soon this is the technology that we use
behind it it's called playground AI uh
playground.com that's create you type in
your prompt and you put it in and I find
this is even better than Leonardo AI in
some uh cases and 100 images a day a day
generated so obviously we can keep
running off of this and then we will
switch over to
vn.com says faceap you get about eight
credits a day but if I switch your phone
and laptop that's 16 credits without
having to sign in or pay for anything
that's perfectly good that's more than
enough heav we post like three images
daily um and we're already bringing in
the followers so there we go that is our
path the s24 ultra
report um also on the tech boy.org no
sponsor post yet but we're going to get
some soon thank you in fact our top post
this week is our very first sponsored
post writing children's books with
Nelson R Elliot founder of copper
jungle
um unfortunately it appears at the
Galaxy A35 and 55 is not coming to
America but but here are some
Alternatives that you can seek uh if you
don't want the 835 which would retail
for about
um 367 to 488
USD
really it's pretty
expensive uh okay so the Galaxy a54 T
and basically the same phone so the a54
is basically the A35 okay s22 plus it's
older but it's better unfortunately you
do lose our on micro SD card SL
compatibility it's glass so it's pretty
tough glass from personal experience but
still you may want a plastic phone and
you won't get as many updates though
it's probably still going to feel faster
on Android say 14 then the 35 would fill
on 16 17 18 19
20 and then the a25 is it's the cheaper
option and it's from this generation so
it's going to have some of the newer
technology and features but of course no
AI features nothing like that it's just
a normal basic run-in the-middle $200
Android phone with Samsung you know
branding on it oh here it is on theeb
boy.org so as you can see our number one
article was our sponsored post and then
our article for this week was the Galaxy
A35 um we're saving articles right now
so that people want to do spons Post
have them without cled up by all our um
stuff right here but now we got to get
to the big story of the week
um the gala not Galaxy the Apple versus
doj dispute so personally I believe the
Galaxy S sorry apple apple
um Apple I don't like them at all but
but but I want them to win
it and keep the things the way they are
because if if they become open stuff
then Android becomes better worse or
there's less of a reason to buy Android
like if if you hold up say the Sams X
s22 Plus and the iPhone 15 plus right
obviously I picked the Samsung or s24
plus over the 15 plus right Samsung all
the way first of all Samsung has better
AI it has more and better cameras uh and
the screen technology is better all
right but let's say under this new
hypothetical law the iPhone 16 plus and
the iPhone and the s25 plus yes
Samsung's gonna have the better camera
Apple's not gonna add the telephone on
they regular right and yes it's probably
still still gonna have the better screen
technology but like if you can download
random apps from the internet like if
you can download your apks right if you
can you know use it on a proper foul
system if you can I mean
text people on any application that you
want to from it uh split screen I mean
just there be serious pressure on
Android so this lawsuit would
technically make apple better it make it
more like Android which would be
annoying because you know I want people
to buy Android phones because they're
bat all right but here we have a video
reaction to
it let we just fast forward do the intro
and then we'll get to the press
conference and the
commentary okay here we
go about 70% of Americans own an iPhone
that's kind of sad
honestly uh for it's about 89% so 87%
actually most Americans are pretty Happ
with their
iPhone
um I'd say it's just that most of them
don't
know like their conception about iPhone
is like oh iPhone x it's $1,000 $1,000
$1,000 right there's never been a
Samsung phone except for except for
maybe the Galaxy fold but someone's like
$1,000,000 when you say Samsung people
think like stuff like 803s a825 a13 why
because that's what sells the most
that's what they go in to the phone
store they see them up there uh you know
on TV uh that Christian phone company
what's it called Patron mobile right you
get them you get that Samsung 8113 815
something for free right so that's why
people don't have the conception but Sam
Apple a never gives their phone away I
mean their two-year old iPhone SE I'm
pretty sure it's still for $29 same
price when it launched launched out
right um on Boost Mobile if you want an
iPhone you can get a four three year old
iPhone right and you still have to pay
for it $99 okay if someone tries to do
that with a Samsung say
like S21 s20 right they better be giving
that thing away for
free you know how you know because I
paying more for their iPhone than
they're paying for an Android again not
necessarily uh since the way phones work
in the United
States they uh they go by contract and
also that point I getting is wrong
because if you pay $8.99 Samsung and
Apple okay biggest companies here uh
they they're the same price essentially
Samsung is a little bit cheaper but I
mean people just don't know better so
it's not that they
don't like Android they like the iPhone
because it is an extremely user friendly
product it's not that useful I use I'm
like what are you doing what is this
what is this button and why is this foul
system so bad like Apple's products
their computers their and their
computers it's about 17 30 something per
of the market show I mean they're the
number two computer company uh OS show
in the world but it's like Windows 80
something per Apple into 10% and then
Chrome OS 3% and that's heavily
leveraged by a bunch of students who are
like forced to use chromeos
airpods
airpods I mean if you were to compare
all of the
earbuds to airpods I'm pretty sure that
all of earbuds are over them especially
since most people have airpods have
iPhones iPads they like iPads it's the
default tablet Samsung noovo all of
those things because they're incredibly
effective and user friendly no it's
because Apple's marketing is pretty good
and it's what carriers are given to push
and since carriers are pushing them
consumers use them consumers don't
really like to change between ecosystems
and platforms like once you got Apple
watch the iPhone and like I mean you're
always going to get an iPhone you're
always going to get an Apple Watch so
naturally the Biden doj is now going
after Okay so let's go get to
the interview wait a sec this is from
Washington there we go grainy video can
ATT test ever seen a green text message
this part is funny okay this guy is like
I don't know 100 and go and as any
iPhone user who has ever seen a green
text message or received a tiny grainy
video can
attest again I me he's explaining to us
how texting works like we know how that
works Apple's anti-competitive conduct
also includes making it more difficult
for iPhone users to message with users
of non-apple products I mean it's not
difficult it's just social stigma I mean
it's kind of Apple's fault and it's also
kind of people's fault just for being a
bunch of bullies
it does this by diminishing the
functionality of its own messaging app
and by diminishing the functionality of
third-party messaging
apps uh I don't know how it diminishes
the functionality of third proving
messaging applications like if you
download signal or telegram or WhatsApp
on an iPhone right and you message
another signal telegram or Whatsapp USU
it's uh not diminished at all just just
get all your friends these W signal
um if you mean now it does uh the
minister qu the of SMS messaging
applications because that's the way SMS
was designed wasn't designed for
reactions or anything like that but we
have RCS now which it's going to get so
I don't even know why this lawsuit is in
uh going to apply now because RCS is
coming on the iOS 18 update um next year
so it's going to be more interoperable
with Android phones it's still going to
have green Pur but videos and reactions
should show up better
by doing so Apple knowingly and
deliberately degrades quality well yes
Apple knows what they're doing they're
a$2 trillion dollar company you don't
think they know what they're doing
privacy and well I mean privacy it's not
Apple's job to ensure the privacy of
well anybody so it's it's it's nice that
they do it for iPhones I mean again not
really anyone's going to be intercepting
your text messages over the air unless
you're getting them for one time
password or like have sent information
which then I mean that's kind of your
fault for sending them over SMS in the
first place um now if the most likely if
it's going to get Mar on your phone
which
then you can't really do anything with
that if it's encrypted or not because
it's decrypts onto the phone and can
always six screenshots security for its
users for example if an iPhone user
messages a non iPhone user in BR if an
iPhone user messages a non
iPhone
oh really
like like who else would they be
messaging just say
Android you think we have running around
out here with kyos phones in America the
only people have kyos phones are 80y
olds and uh yeah that's it in apple
messages the text appears not only again
Apple messages that's not a thing say I
message there such thing as Apple
messages as a green bubble but appears
as a green bubble okay it's not really a
any trust any consumer thing when green
is actually good for your eyes so when
iPhone message users text Android users
and give them green they're providing
them a favor a benefit it incorporates
limited functionality again yes and we
tried to fix that with sunb which was
annoying sunb was great but didn't app
will broke it so if you could suit them
and they get bring sunb back I'd be all
for it the conversation is not encrypted
again like okay video are pixelated and
grainy and users cannot edit messages or
see typing indicators you could never
edit messages until like 15 minutes ago
editing messages is a brand new feature
in 2010 or 2014 or 2018 no one is
editing messages unless they like on
Discord or Whatsapp or anything like
that iMessage as a whole just is bad
okay it's it's it's not good compared to
say what the only good thing about it
that it has is like the little game
things as
iPhone users perceive rival smartphones
as being lower quality yes because
iPhone users when they do that it
becomes their own little social class
little social ticket and they become
snobbish that's teenagers all over again
okay because the experience of messaging
friends and family who do not own
iPhones is worse right and also Apple
sub tries to trick you into thinking
that it's bad uh to have Android phones
because they don't want you to do that
even in their own presentation okay look
look I'm going to bring up
uh here's the official Apple Facetime on
Android
thing uh where is
it me look at this this is the FaceTime
on Android or Windows device here we
have a military style Windows computer
that look like it's from 2007 that's so
bad it still has a CD drive a wireless
indicator battery and like storage
indicator right there okay and then for
Android
devices
uh where was
it here it is FaceTime on Android
device I think this is the official
Apple thing uh was pretty similar to
this image here just have this like nice
clear screen iPhone here and then this
like budget more bezel and screen
Android phone here of course Apple
doesn't want you to think that opposing
products look good it's did job which is
annoying by way I'm not defending
Apple wait so you mean that Apple
doesn't want to subsidize
Android wait what that's what he's
saying right there he's saying doesn't
want to do cryptography for messages
with Android and if Android wants to
upgrade its own abilities then it should
upgrade its own abilities okay that that
is a terrible take right there Android
has upgraded the abilities with RCS and
Android did hack into iMessage with
sunbo okay for like two days it was a
glorious day December 6th December 7th
and December 8th they all crashed down
okay I'm not like this is a terrible
take what how on Earth are they supposed
to use ibash drift out hacking into it
Android messages is based upon SMS right
and RDS now okay
um it's not like there's a beta program
where Apple's like okay look Android
users if you're messaging application
meets these standards will let you in no
apple deliberately deliberately uh does
not allow people to get imess because
they know iMessage is the key's iPhone
sales so this the key iPhone sales right
po you get them in with imessage it
starts from like sixth graders that high
schoolers right who uh apparently bully
you over green bble and not being able
to send uh images in
high high quality video high quality
right once you get your iPhone then
maybe they'll get you an Apple Watch
Once you ins the ecosystem you got an
Apple Watch iPad uh Apple TV right
MacBook then then you're hooked because
let's say you took that out you take
iPhone out and say you replace with the
same price Android phone so iPhone 15
check it out put in s204 right then
you're
like uh wait what am I supposed to do
with this watch I can't use it piece of
junk so you have to sell it or not and
then it's not syncing with your you know
your your tablet uh so you have to use
St Party Services like Google who is all
too happy to give their stuff to Apple
or sell their stuff to Apple I mean
default search engine on iPhones it it's
about to become the default AI assistant
on iPhones uh you can download Google
assistant on iPhones okay Google doesn't
really care if you down if you use
Android Samsung and well LG used to and
motola and all these companies those are
the ones
that is that a monopoly
problem like who who is the crowd for
this this is like well I mean the crowd
for this would be kind of like
Android users I guess not iPhone users
Android users who are like yeah get them
Apple but I uh stand with apple H
unfortunately because I don't want this
stuff it will may I message bring back b
mini bring back b mini um but I don't
want Apple to get better being forced by
the government that's what like the EU
it's annoying like why do they think
they have the power to Mandate of
charging port that phones use let Apple
users stay back in Stone Age with
lightning ports and make Android better
right um make uh Apple users stay back
in their little club with imessage and
make Android better make Apple users
stay back with their Clos life ecosystem
and and let Android users use apks to
make Android better if both operating
systems are the same right then I'm just
going to buy the stuff that has the best
hardware and the hardware is essentially
the same is right now I mean Samsung
buity is winning the hardware world with
better features with the hardware like
reverse powershare on device AI better
cameras and stylish but if Apple I mean
if the EU says hey look Samsung pretty
big company here uh you need a stylus in
your phone Apple you need to have uh
what it called apple pencil all right uh
you need to allow split screening on
your phone because it's any competitive
not to uh you need to allow sight
loading on your phone because it's any
competitive not to you need to allow
browsers to use the engin because any
competitive not to I mean I might as
well just mandate that all iPhones screw
iOS and use Android download the iOS
launer that's basically what the EU and
I guess the doj US wants which Apple's
obvious G to win like2 trillion doll
company you think this is going to bend
over and be like n we we'll use Android
right
so yeah that's my take on that now
speaking about ecosyst systems we got to
talk about the Samsung
ecosystem uh
which
is uh almost I say as good as the Apple
ecosystem NBT nothing but
Tech used the Samsung ecosystem for a
few
days want to
upgrade still paying off your locked
phone break free from three-year device
contracts Samsung makes many different
products they make phones tablets
headphones watches in a lot of key
categories they have the best-in-class
product but some let's go through these
projects we got the Galaxy s24 Ultra
Galaxy S Tab S9 many different products
they make phones tablets headphones
watches in a lot of key categories they
have the best-in-class product but
something really unique about them is
that their products work really well
with each other it's not really unique
it's just that most people companies
don't have products like there's not
really a motor tablet or computer that
you can go out and buy but also really
well and so today's video I'm gonna
switch every product in my life to the
Samsung version to see what performs
starting with the phone this is s24
ultra it just came out pretty good phone
to switch to in my opinion now if you
don't want that iPhone I'll take it and
then sell it have to s24 ultra last
month and there are a bunch of really
interesting features that they added
over the s23 ultra that I'm excited to
test out throughout the day including
some camera upgrades so s24 Ultra has
multiple resolution option I mean
honestly the s24 ultra kind of looks
better I mean she's more zoomed in here
but mean she looks no off dead she looks
like she's dying on this camera here she
looks you know better here 8K video this
is 4K video from the s24 ultra and it
also is the first Samsung phone to have
a qual Telly system so the zoom range is
much improved we're going to test that
today most part here is the footage
looks really good for video in the past
I feel like Samsung was excellent at
photo but video there was a pretty big
difference and Samsung has also
partnered with Google on a really cool
feature called Circle to search so for
example if I take a picture of my cof
that's a good feature I I want it to
come to my phone here and then I go to
view that picture I hold down on the
home button it will kind of prompt this
Google screen where I can Circle
something and it will search this image
without my having to leave the app and
now I can go here and see all similar
images I think it's really nice that
Google and Samsung work so closely
together on a lot of features um so for
example but I do like Samsung's other
apps Samsung email Samsung Notes instead
of Google keep and Bixby mix something
called Bixby which is their voice
assistant not beloved in the Tech
Community but then yeah I belove it
Google has Google assistant and you can
actually set that as the default
assistant on this phone you want to
because I'm using Samsung products 13
degrees fhe Celsius
dang to day I'm actually G to use Bixby
so what we're going to do right now is
compare how Bixby responds to three
different questions and then how Google
Assistant does to see what the contrast
is between them because I feel like bxby
gets a lot of hate but they have been
subtly kind of improving it over the
years and I want to actually see if that
has led to any real world Improvement
how old is the President of the United
States 81 years old where was he born
Joe Biden was born in Scranton how old
is the President of the United States 81
be kind of funny if you gave him a
different age one person said 80 one
person 81 You' have to fat check thator
here's I found onine what's it
say oh it's just that question I was not
able to keep up the fact let me try this
on my Galaxy s24 maybe Samsung saw this
video I was like oh no
okay you
go
how old is the President of the United
States
what how old is
he I didn't understand that okay how old
is the President of the United
States
oh kind of sad still talking about Joe
Biden one of the main advantages of
Google assistant is that not only does
it have like really good conversational
memory like you can ask multiple
questions in sequence and it will know
that you're still asking about the
previous line of thought like for
example asking someone's age and then
asking where they were born it will
remember that that's what you're talking
about but the other main advantage is
they have Gemini which is their AI um
and Samsung is obviously much fed behind
on AI development so it's cool to see
Samsung partner with Google if you get a
Samsung phone it is Android and a lot of
those Google Ex yeah yeah Geminis pilot
is better in my opinion that's right
Google is better than being copilot is
better than Gemini cuz Gemini Coop
actually has this interesting feature
here at least on Windows computers where
let me show it to
you here we
go you
can here we
go
and when you open CoPilot hopefully it's
loading so as you can see it's on the
side oh you can't even see copilot let
me let me try
again so here we go when you open
co-pilot as you can see on the side of
the screen
here come on come
on
it's kind of slow
so that's not good here we go there we
go you can click this thing here add a
screenshot and you can screenshot what
you're searching and I use this for the
Instagram influencer all the time and I
say and it can generate good images of
people and sarch images of people um so
that that's a useful feature right there
in my opinion and it's going to generate
some hashtags for us so while it's doing
that let's go back to our
video it's 11:59 a.m. check you that on
the Galaxy watch 6 classic which um is
their main Smartwatch they have their
regular version I'm going to go work out
with this a little bit later today it is
just such an outrageously beautiful day
in New York on days like this or
honestly any type of day I often go for
a very long walk and I'll wear
headphones to listen to either music or
a podcast an Audi book I wonder if she
listens to her own podcast and the
Galaxy buds 2 by Samsung I feel like are
one of their most underrated products
they are great they're $99 and they have
a really Slim small build that when it
goes in your ear I feel like it's very
easy to forget it's in there it's only
five grams for each Bud respectively and
they have really good battery life and I
feel like with competitor products like
five crackers let's say the airpods some
people feel like they don't stay in
their ear that well because there's not
a tip for my ears they actually stay
really well I think I'm just lucky that
my ear shape works for them but for an
earbud like this yeah never no have tips
you can but the airpods don't have tips
try multiple sizes of so you can get a
more secure fit and they're so
comfortable for an extended period of
time the Cape is also really small which
I like and the sound quality is great
like I feel like there's a lot of face
and it really brings music to light they
work with the Samsung phone they
honestly also work with iPhones or other
Android phones and I feel like people
don't talk about them enough for how
good they are so on a day like this
popping them in and just going for a
walk and I love
[Music]
it Samsung has an app called Samsung
Health which allows you to pair with
their wearables this is the Samsung
Galaxy watch 6 classic and we'll be able
to get our workout out it into the app
and we can analyze it later and I've
been using a lot of the cycling workout
preset because I stress fractur my hips
I haven't been able to do my normal
running so cycling has become the main
form of cardio right now which is wild
because like a month ago I didn't know
how to ride a bike she just like AA
Parker from V odyy still a novice but
beautiful day for Park so I'm going to
start a workout right now by swiping
over here and hitting cycling and it
will bring us in and there we go one of
the cool things about the Samsung Galaxy
watch 6 and the classic is that it has
different Zone modes so you can see
which heart rate zone you're in during
your workout so you know if you want to
push it or keep at a slow pace and then
it will also track where you're biking
like it will give you a map and
post Hyundai Sonata versus Honda Accord
look what Sonata has and
what quick little mini bike ride done
still need to get better at the mounting
and dismounting process so the watching
you stop to work out and it will
actually Auto pause it and then I can
use the rotating vessel here to slide
down and see what my heart rate is what
zone I'm in what my minimum part rate
was and my average throughout the
workout and then if I slide over here I
can access my music controls like if I
was using the Galaxy buds 2 at the same
time and I can actually adjust the media
the volume with the rotating bezel which
is pretty clutch like I feel like having
a that's pretty goodal interaction Point
makes this a little bit better than the
regular Galaxy watch normal version but
you do pay $3.99 for this so it's about
$100 more and then if I hit the button
on the side here I can access the
controls to finish the oret resume it or
start a new I'm going to hit finish and
it's collecting that that is I wonder
what the seven will have like what kind
of features could they have today maybe
they camera that would be nice um the
first sync ride because I just paired
this with a new uh phone paired it with
the s24 ultra 6.9 miles was the max
speed and if we go over to the s24 ultra
here you can this is pretty slow see
that it's paired with the watch it has
the battery life time I think we're
going to be able to get given 64% watch
faces Etc and if I open up the health
app here this integration will
immediately have wow that Ting or a
super fast phone thatd be nice if my
phone was that fast my bike i' come up
the amount of calories burn dur it and
the speed on the
bike the tab S9 is the next part of the
ecosystem it's the 11in $699 tablet that
actually comes with an S Pen feel like
it's a great value product the build is
really nice it's pretty thin and the S
Pen snaps onto the back magnetically a
lot of other tablets on the market like
we think about the iPad have the stylus
as an additional purchase but I think
$129 for an iPad you know maybe the dog
is gonna make it so that uh you have to
include styly in all your purchases feel
like the Spen is so built into how you
interact anything from writing on the
screen that goes from handwriting to
text or taking notes like if you're a
student I still think a laptop is the
far superior setup for school it just
makes it so much easier I feel like
anytime I've tried to make a tablet work
it's always been like a weird workaround
and not like an actual convenience
utility ad for most things and the
tablet makes sense also comes enabled
with Quick Share which is Samsung's
ability to quickly share files among
which is now integrated into Android and
laptops uh Samsung at least uh so they
merged nearby sure I've been having
problems oh hello Samsung has good
Chargers yeah I do yes oh so janaa
welcome back to the channel uh last time
you were here we were helping teach you
about technology uh do you still want us
to do
that different Android devices used to
just be Samsung devices now it's
anything with Android because of their
partnership and I also like the QR code
stuff as well Google it's very
reminiscent of airdrop and it works
really well and you can also lots of
view oh we dropped someone left all
right great ask away when we done this
video we'll go the
tutorial system like for example I would
love to be able to copy something on the
s24 ultra and then and you can do that
see then comments somewhere it is hi MBT
Community
uh he you having magic day one correct I
was wrong Samsung does have copy paste
let's go Samsung paste it on here it's
little things like that that just kind
of feel like a magic ecosystem U why
You' want to buy all of your products
from one brand it also has a really wide
from facing camera which is incredible
for if you're like on a zoom room or
it's not good if you say like trying to
hide your location
which doesn't look like the sharpest
quality in the world yeah it looks like
720p but it could be the what's it set
it yeah
720p um it is technically 4K but this
just goes to show like the quality of
the sensor is a little bit more
multifaceted than just the um resolution
that it should yeah my drone says it's
in 4k thing looks like if you're shot
off of a smartwatch it's hovering into
air no stability in lines there is a
flying Wi-Fi rou but
still but 4K fixp video scam color
balancing like moving all around this we
work right now and the back facing
camera I think the iPad lineup has a
better camera than this this does not
look as sharp to me well the iPad lineup
you probably have to computer to say the
iPad Air rather than the Galaxy than
this one to like the iPad Pros because
the S9 plus is dual cameras so and it
really starts to fall apart when you
zoom in a lot who Zooms in on a tablet
though I would like to see a tablet with
good cameras when I went to the beta
store when they were still in business
at the Galleria uh they did have a 3D
tablet that's pretty nice but I feel
like in general the main thing is just
having a camera that works well and I
actually like the placement a lot of the
camera the placement is at the top um
when you're holding it in landscape mode
which I feel like is how a lot of people
would use it for video calls versus
having it on
like where then it looks like you're
looking off to the side um in kind of a
bizarre way so let me know what you
think though of this image quality from
the front facing camera this is such a
fun day using all the sampling products
I feel like Samsung does not get a lot
of credit for a how extensive their
ecosystem is and then B how great a lot
of the products are like I feel like
headphones with the tablet this must
have been awful imagine having to used a
pixel tablet which is basically a
glorified Nest Hub Max uh for a whole
day as like a tablet no stylus you know
got that weird looking back and then
hopefully she pick the good pixel pixel
8 Pro it can actually support Gemini
Nano uh sorry pixel 8 uh guess your
screen wasn't big enough or something
all right anyway let's go to janaa who
has Tech questions for us uh back in the
studio of the techb boy.org
and yeah so guys we're on the path to
the Galaxy s24 Ultra we got to get it in
less than 40 days so I can record a
school news video on it so remember to
support the channel by clicking our ads
um utilizing our virtual influencer AA
and
uh uh also requesting spaed post
on uh detch
boy. oh also you know sending products
so that we can test review and sell them
so say send the phone we review it or
sell it or anything like that U maybe
probably won't drop test it because the
value goes down but if it gets fused
then you know it's
manageable but as we are waiting for our
first technological question let's see
what it is I'm trying to think of
questions with my limited knowledge okay
so as we wait we can go check out our
sweet Trix oh wait wait did I get a
slack messages about the
thing I almost forgot to check my slack
this could be our first big sponsored
post break y'all about app apps and
stuff like that
come on internet here is kind of
slow right see any questions what kind
of phone do I use and what are its pros
and cons all right so right now I'm
using the Galaxy s22 plus and I'm
pushing for an s24 ultra all right so we
did a full review of this phone over on
the Block but the pros of this phone it
runs Android big screen 120 HZ display
and a pretty decent camera all right
good pictures decent video um the cons
are the battery life is kind of sad ises
a bad chip so sometimes overheats uh the
charging speed is pretty good though so
that is it's acceptable
25 25 watts oh no no actually is the
plus model so 45 wats
charging 45 watch charging is pretty
good
um Andrew have big screen yeah this
screen here is
6.6 in and it does have big which M it's
an old Motorola okay
um yeah so here's the phone right here
this is actually the way the back looks
it's a skin that I got sent to
me all right let's see oh as in a few
years this a few years too came out in
2022 that's why it's called s22 has
large pixels and the camera quality is
mid yeah so what they budget phones like
those molas and noo or not noos they try
to use big pixels like 48 50 megapixels
to bring in BIOS but the CER sizes are
small so when there's not when there's
lots of light when there's lots of light
it's pretty good pretty good but when
there's medium light so say lighting
condition like this room here uh it's
not going to take good pictures at all
the screen is massive and the loading
quality is pretty good what the heck is
loading quality like the speed of the
phone what one thing about my s22 plus
like it's supposed to be fast but it's
sometimes slow like searching through
stuff or swiping it's like what are you
doing oh that's pretty good what kind of
Motorola is
it like in fact there's a pretty good
video about this uh it's about the some
Poco phone which is a sh me offshoot
um so they made a phone with a 200
megapixel camera right Pages it's hor
horrible in online wait it's horrible in
some yeah because the censor size isn't
good now if you have a prom mode on your
uh uh on on your phone you can increase
the iso and aperture and maybe not
aperture but it to let in more light but
then you're gon it's gonna take a longer
to take a picture it's 5G oh so you
probably like the motor style 5G pages
and things load quick well that makes
sense I mean page has been able to load
quick since for a long time in fact like
phones if you think about it it's 24 now
2014 iPhone 6s came out think about
you're high school say 10th grade
whatever with iPhone 6s and high school
say Galaxy
s24 all right I mean they probably do
the same things I Instagram and Snapchat
which is really weird app it's
like to people like the're terrible
pictures like why would you buy the best
picture uh quality uh for for your phone
okay and then proceed to take terriable
P pictures
of yourself on Snapchat like really why
but I mean you basically do the same
things from a phone from 10 years ago
and a phone today just that it's faster
and well phones nowadays have ai built
into
them
uh let's see what is our Christian
advertising Network christianet.com let
us see how many profits we made from the
greatest Tech site on planet at tech.org
a week after we put it into advertising
let log in here
um any other technology questions oh
wait yeah yeah I don't care much about
quality exactly yeah I mean Snapchat is
such a weird
application um things other people do
like scan photo MTH bunch of Cheetos uh
stuff bunch of camera applications but
they don't really they don't really try
that hard like at least I try like I
edit videos on my phone so if I was a
high schooler 10 years ago with the
iPhone 6s
Galaxy S5 and I recorded and edited
videos on my phone first of all the
videos were like awful we'd be trying to
upscale to 4K uh well I mean you could
have recording 4K back then but it
really wasn't that good um and editing
would take a long time also snap snap
snap Snapchat has a lot of Christians
really I mean everyone in my school
Snapchat so I guess they could be
skewing the count um
um but you can't even upload images can
you I have to like take them which is
kind of hard if you're running a virtual
AI influencer like how am I supposed to
take a picture of a fake person it's not
like I can just upload screenshots of um
all right anyway back to our Christian
advertising
website uh today we made nothing we made
zip all right but over the month we have
made with 100 30 Impressions put your
hands together for 10 cents we made 10
cents you can't even see this can you we
made 10 cents with our
ads I mean we don't have time we need
this phone before like want to actually
use it to edit video and stuff I mean 10
cents I can't even pay tax for the
phone I could even buy a wallpaper
screen protector or an app 10
cents we're going to have to get more
ads um people start clicking go go watch
those Christian movies that are on the
site from
pureflix anyway M the bus talked about
this Poco phone shiai split
off I mean sales tax not like regular
like tax tax business taxes or employee
tax not employee tax personal taxes I
mean sales tax I couldn't even pay sales
tax for the
phone hopefully it's built in your tax
before after you receed your paycheck
and then on every individual item you
purchase true which means that 10 cents
might as well be negative 10 cents uh
here we go oh wow he's close well close
in the context says I'm close to him oh
only 500,000 subscribers to beat Apple I
mean yeah technically only 5,000
subscrib I only need 500,000 subscribers
to be a 500,000 subscriber channel so
I'm really close but I mean he he can he
can move okay I mean my uh AI influencer
is going to have more followers than
this actual Channel than um in like a
day uh she might have it more than out
just like anything involves money but
yeah all right let's see his Poco Rie
oh wait wait wait wait wait the nothing
phone 2A he did a review on it I did not
get a notification that's check this out
this is a nothing phone what do you
think about nothing
janaa here's one thing you need to do
before you buy anything online don't
spend another dime on Amazon and
when the nothing tech company first
launched in 2020 their oh wow I remember
being in the nothing comment and B see
never heard of it like to know here we
go let's go oh big selling point was
that they were going to build technology
that faded into the background Tech that
improves your life and keeps you more
connected but without getting in the way
of it oh yes yes Tech that Fades into
the background so let me think let's put
a whole bunch of lights on the back of
phone that will really Fade Into the
back and I absolutely love that vision
launched the nothing phone one which
sort of did that with this glyph
lighting system ah yes yes you know how
your phone is always so annoying with
all your Instagram messages from all
your friends and stuff you know it's so
distracting with your emlet
display let's put an entire flashlight
on the back of the phone that will
really keep you uh less distracted that
meant you could keep your phone faed out
it looks like a
bomb but still see your notifications
from the back yeah which if it's like
any kid probably goes to my school one
of those weird Snapchats at taking at 3:
in the morning with like terrible
lighting conditions that thing just
might as well be a nightlight just plug
it in and make it a nightlight you're
gonna be getting notifications every two
seconds you might as well just keep the
screen on or anyone who owns that phone
can't cheat I'm pretty sure you can turn
the lights off and uh no one in the
United States oh that kind of cheat well
I mean of course you could turn off the
lights well yeah it'd be kind of
annoying but then like there's no reason
to buy the phone it's just like some
random
uh uh Google pixel 5A in fact when this
phone came out we said bye to Google
pixel 5A instead of this piece of junk
uh we got like 100 views on our website
that day I was like
wow then the phone 2 which did the same
thing it's actually a flagship which was
nice slightly better and now we've got
our third the most affordable so far the
nothing phone he looks like a pair of
binoculars right there 2A which is $349
for top end 12 GB Ram model I wonder
which would be better the 2A or the
original nothing phone which would
probably be the same for
I gosh oh my gosh' be kind of funny just
use it as a nightlight and I think this
is a really good opportunity 12 gigs of
RAM on a 300 l
phone oh my
gosh this company has had three whole
phone releases to decide is what they're
doing actually achieving their goal can
using a nothing phone and improve your
life make you a more present person I
mean it wouldn't improve my life the
camera I mean I if I got that phone or
any of the nothing phones from my phone
I lose a camera have a giant flashlight
on the back of my phone and
um I don't even know if it works on 5G
in the United States because it's a
British phone company you 330 well I
mean it's probably better than your
phone from for $330 but at least you
have a stylist cuz I'm pretty sure you
can find a motor Styler 5 for like $90
on eBay we sold a phone similar to it
from TCL for
140 but this is more of an aesthetic
phone it's more based upon the looks
more than digital detox which is a
terrible way to run a brand oh yes yes
uh well yeah it's British well I mean
Motorola is not even American anymore
they're Chinese uh Samsung South Korean
uh LG was also South Korean apple is
American Nokia is European I think
the're Finnish and yeah so most foam
Brands aren't from the United States I'm
pretty sure the only two foam Brands we
have here maybe three technically if you
count cat which uh which phones are
built by the bullet Group which is also
British
um so apple is American and then there's
this phone called jelly jollo something
like that which is also American they
make oh Plum pH yeah Plum phones people
more focusing on packaging actually
they're focused on less packaging to
save the environment which is stupid
like just give me a charger and
earphones in a box I paid $1,000 for
well I didn't pay but allegedly people
are well I mean a nothing phone here
isn't too popular because it's an
Android phone and everyone in United
States thinks oh airphones are better
that's what we talked about at the
beginning even though Android is
objectively better than iOS it has
better features set and it's more
affordable and you get more features
like that like that but if say apple
came up with a grand idea to put a LED
flashlight on the back of a phone people
be acting like it's the best thing since
they added a dynamic Island to the back
to their
phones or are these really just basic
phones but with batty designs for people
who are happy to sacrifice value to be
different let's figure it out I mean if
you want to be different go get a case
in fact I'm going to give my friend wait
a I got these like random iPhone 14
cases from a company and I don't have an
iPhone 14 and unfortunately the case
company didn't send me a phone to go
with it I'm just going to give them to
someone Android is definitely better let
me think about it you we are the only
phones that support styluses uh natively
you got your moot to stylus there so
people want to feel wealthy yeah and IM
is lock in apple locks you in Samsung
you can always leave now I mean with the
Samsung watch you have to stay with
Android but that's because apple is so
restrictive and like I only knew
personally one person who used a Samsung
watch with an iPhone which I mean good
for him good on
him so this is the package I got from
nothing okay there's a white that box
look like it got stepped on like I don't
care about the box but I mean for
company that prizes aesthetic and design
over all else it's kind of bad 2A and
then a black how adventurous oh they
gave you oh okay it's to a viewers box
because pretty sure they won't be giving
you two phones if I sign that is kind of
the intention though so let's un again
looks like binoculars right there kind
of looks like a robot the white one it's
an unfortunately thin package which
means no charger but dangit where
credits due at the very least it's got
personality I would rather have a
charger in the box and personality I
don't know about you but I mean you're
going to throw that box away uh cuz it's
design and that's actually the box so
the phone's probably actually smaller
that's just the design on the box I'm
saying like they spent more time on the
packaging of the Box than they probably
did on the actual phone unlike the Sea
of generic phones you have to Wade
through at this price point and also fun
transparent nothing cable yeah I mean
that's great it better be a good cable
and it better work oh these peels are
looking pretty tasty what the oh wait
wait wait wait so the white why that's
so weird why would you do that me at
this point just move it down to the
bottom and make it C
mounted
po my gosh why would you do this and now
the black it's nice to see a
pre-installed screen protector on these
two I I think that's called plastic but
I'm not sure and immediately the second
nothing nothing I will gladly say great
things about your company if you pay me
money uh that charger looks like an
incon inconvenience incompatible with
other no no no no no that charg is
normal it's USBC it would work with your
phone that's how to make
Chargers yeah
smartphones uh the charger is compatible
that's the way my charger is it just
looks different that you or my charger
could charge your phone which charge on
iPhone anyone picks this up you will get
a reaction it might not be a good
oneisha thinks it looks like a face with
some intestines coming out okay which is
fair and I can't completely erase that
image from my mind now and Joseph and my
team just burst out laughing the design
is clearly not for everyone and you are
going to exactly which is why I use
successful companies like I don't know
Apple Samsung don't go out they would be
like yeah let's uh let's do
this have to be ready to defend your
choice to people but there's a few
reasons why I personally oh it actually
looks good in black with like the lights
on it and this is actually if the lights
get bright enough would be good for
filming because you can get lights on
people not good if you're at an online
flame water do rate it part of it is the
screen to achieve even slim screen
borders like this at a sub three that
launcher looks horrible I mean this look
why I mean we say it's to get you off
your phone but how are you supposed to
make money
H how on Earth are you supposed to make
money if people aren't on their phone
you're in the business to make money
that's how capitalism works okay people
aren't going to be like oh man look at
the bezels of this phone look at the
back of this phone because phone start
to do
R
like just launcher which I know you can
change but if that's a default icon back
that's just terrible everything's in
Black I think you can change some setup
which is good but I mean you just hand
this to someone they be like what are
you doing
Sur like I could barely identify this
let's see surf Shar X
threads messages phone Chrome YouTube
some random thing there I don't even
know what that oh YouTube Studio uu
which if the Uber didn't have a word
Mark you couldn't even read the thing
it's just like a black circle
Facebook uh Prime video I think yeah I
don't even know what that is selfie
camera $350 price point it's very hard
to ignore like when I cycle between my
$1,200 s24 Ultra and this yes I prefer
the s24 ultra obvious oh really I mean I
prefer a phone four times more yeah I
mean I I get it you know you want people
to be off their phones less which is why
it's terrible stuff like this exists let
me show you this
uh but but selling a product so that
people don't use the product has got to
be the dumbest has got to be the dumbest
idea of all time
selling a product so that people don't
use the product is just like makes no
sense look at this look at this phone
here first of all go back to 2007 from
when you
came okay it's using an e in
display a text based interface and look
at this it's a little keyboard at the
bottom like
why why would you do
this it's the ultimate sacrifice for the
gr you're good yeah and you know what's
going to happen they're going to go out
of business because someone's gonna buy
stuff that they don't want to use I mean
at this point you might as well just
start setting phones with cracked
screens and no batteries that will get
people to stop using your phone obiously
but it doesn't feel like I'm jumping
from expensive phone to cheap phone
which in itself is an achievement part
of it is the sides it's got a completely
print resistant finish I like that it's
flat it's great for holding and pick uh
your phone taking video and stuff like
that I love these matte black buttons
and also how you can kind of see bits
hey Matt Black is in kbd oh also we're
also raising money uh
for yeah maybe if it's Apple but not
Android
uh yeah also raising money for a digital
voice recorder uh for Spy War thing so
uh that that got the cluee so we also be
using money for that to review on that
well yeah but the same people buying
those poses uh are buying iPhones okay
no person who has a $500 post has an
Android
phone wait denim like jeans oh yeah no
person who has a
denim post that costs $500 will even
look at an Android
phone mm
yeah so so uh back to fundraising for a
second here we're raising money for s24
Ultra of course coins and we're also
raising money we just need a few few
dollars uh either on say a few dollars
for a digital voice activated
recorder we need like uh $20 for that so
we're fundraising for that while also
selling there's no gun over here on eBay
um so to support the
channel rear design through it and part
of it is of course this bizarre
uniqueness that you would call the rear
this is a plastic phone by the way which
it's plastic I mean that's good that's
actually a practical thing which is
fairly standard for the price but what I
like is that they've leaned into that
material as opposed to trying to hide it
there's a lot of companies who try and
make their cheaper plastic phones feel
as similar as possible to their
flagships which aming the Sony phones
actually plastic it's pretty good I
wonder how it handles heat okay so let
me post the comment here
here we
go
Made of Glass and Metal but doing that
okay okay made just makes them feel like
knockoff versions of the real thing that
are lighter than a feather and I had a
plastic phone creepier than your
grandma's M whereas with the phone 2A
this feels like it has been
intentionally designed to feel
well but you know a solid premium cool
toy you know those fancy robots you'd
always see on the store shelves as a kid
but you wouldn't even dare to ask your
parents for that's the vibe that I
get
from the phone 2A especially with this
whole glyph lighting interface running
through its veins and whether it is or
it isn't it doesn't feel like yet
another mass produced SL well yeah it's
probably not mass produced because no
one's going to buy it no one's like I
want a budget phone that looks
good but it's made from this obscure
company that everyone makes a joke
about no no no no no he's about to he's
about to drop it on them
look ready what about the software cuz
you can have Crazy Design but if the
goal of nothing is to have Tech that
truly does disappear into the background
of your life in a way that's
fundamentally different to I can make my
phone disappear into the background I
throw it over there somewhere like go
like look now my phone disappeared into
the background anything else out there
then whether or not that succeeds is
going to rest almost entirely on what
it's like to use so one part of it is
the UI this black and white completely
stripped back aesthetic ah yes that's a
feature black and
white which I like there's lots of
useful widgets you know what you know
what there also be a feature this phone
printed out film images the
personalization is great like with your
folders for example you can configure
exactly how you want the app that's
great I I that's actually a pretty good
feature to display and even pick from
nothing style cover photos if you find
that cleaner yes 8 bit uh images which
nice but I mean I me if you're
advertising the 80s as a feature uh
what's next fa machines and the AI
wallpaper generator I think is fantastic
is an AI wallpaper generator that's so
neat because you could screenshot those
and sell them for a profit for free
essentially it's a hem nothing we
haven't seen before but it feels very
much tuned with the nothing minimalist
philosophy in mind they've made it easy
minimalism is annoying say to make
wallpapers that naturally suit the
software's aesthetic with the ability to
make them scrolling wallpapers if you
want and to add atmosphere and the
nothing glass effect to your Creations
now pretty neat don't get me wrong the
software is not exciting to look at but
you think it's in black and white same
type of uh aesthetic since
1901 that's kind of the point it's
trying to strip back the power of any
one individual app to demand your
attention and therefore control your
life and I'm all for that the Temptation
is to say well it's just a black and
white icon pack there are literally
thousands of those for free on the Play
store but there is more to it than that
like yes special black and white the
lock screen widgets for example you get
to pick basically anything from live
widgets to app again you can download
those from the Play Store I did on my
phone I can make my phone look like a
nothing phone in five minutes which
we're g to have an article come out
about this really neat I actually didn't
throw my real phone are you kidding me
uh this really neat uh Google feature on
phones where it actually has picture and
picture now which is great because you
can picture and picture the article that
you're reading and then search something
again on Google really neat really
neat uh let's
see I almost forgot about
this we got like $5 in
this oh man my v a coffee is so old but
that it's I asked for an s23 ultra kind
of funny s23 Ultra would be
nice we are we have a buy me a coffee
here there we
go all right here we go that you can
quick launch to device controls and it's
right there for you to use without you
needing to even AO plane mode lock your
phone and face your
distractions uh you can do that on here
I can put turn my phone in airplane mode
on for my lock screen but there's a
really good reason you want to unlock
your phone to use airplane mode because
if a thief turns airplane mode on your
phone then you won't be able to track it
anymore so every night before I go to
bed I put on airplane mode so that's
there t that's dumb what if you need to
I don't know like call
someone why would you turn on the
flashlight cuz you never know when you
might need it
wait wait wait you're telling me that
you keep your phone on airplane mode at
night but you keep the flashlight
on all the way
around okay that is a compass I've been
doing a lot of potential houses recently
and so anytime I want to check what way
things are facing tap and that is
North
useful except I got an actual compass
that shows all the directions on my
Samsung Edge screen and I can use it it
even shows my
coordinates let's see I can get the we
on here let's see right now I'm am
finding uh 129 degrees
Southeast there you go that's
East so uh that's not pretty that's kind
of useful I guess and also yes I have a
ton of apps but very little is actually
pre-installed on nothing Burns it's
clean and it does which means you're
also broke genuinely feel feel like the
phone is trying to make you use your
Tech less as opposed to most affordable
phones which feel like a gateway to the
company then spamming you with
promotions or trying to sell you on
their services too at least now how do
you think they're going to make money
nothing is going to have to put ads or
something on these phones there isn't
any of that here the software could do
with because nothing is like they're not
even on the top 10 phones list probably
a little more consistency like why when
I'm using completely stock widgets do I
have three different fonts on my home
screen it's meant to be nothing not
everything and also polish like the lock
screen apps they should animate in in
line with this transition as opposed to
just popping in but for the most part
again like
who right let's see I don't like that
form in the style of the phone
yeah it does look good and it does I
didn't see what else it does like is it
fast does it take good pictures how's
the call Quality like actual stuff like
you just spent five minutes talking
about the launcher into packaging
effectively make your phone less ATT
seeking in a good way however however I
don't think this on its own would be
enough for nothing to claim that they're
doing something particularly different
yeah that's not a
feature yeah my phone wants me to use it
less that's why I spent 200 x to get the
same
thing what might though something that
you don't see anywhere else is this
glyph
interace you do su that somewhere else
it's on the UN Hood's phone which
retails about the same price let's be PR
wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa okay
okay I don't like how the phone I don't
think he likes how the phone turns on
and off matter yeah let's be practical
pushing it there there is another phone
that looks like this now it's not good
but there is another phone that looks
like this with their past premium phones
they've had many glyph lighting zones
this being their more budget offering
it's got three and that is actually
completely fine they still look cool the
lighting is high quality and consistent
and they have somewhat limited the
amount that the light bleed into the
rest of the design which helps improve
the perception of precise engineering
but most okay importantly you can
absolutely tell that this nothing
company has spent a lot of time in
boardrooms figuring out every possible
thing that you can do with a set of LEDs
all right all right all right now I'm
not W to knock on a feature I like
features if Samsung had a feature like
this that'd be great
yeah like they can beep different
patterns depending on who's calling
which that would be useful if my phone
was in my pocket all the time but if it
was on the desk yeah that' be useful
just cool and well executed as a feature
even if most of the notifications
themselves do just sound like a fridge
door that needs closing or like a smoke
alarm that needs its batteries replacing
I it's very weird so they spent all
their time on the lights but not on the
sound they can light up when you play
music and sync to that music you know
the useful if uh most music apps don't
like you know most times you look at
them but that's actually pretty useful
as a party check
if you go to
Danes I don't
know I don't know
how well I mean that's the setting point
of the phone take the lights away from
that phone and you have like a piece of
plastic Android phone that thinks having
a black launcher is worth $350 the
promise of all those Philips hu lighting
strips except it does actually work fun
party trick probably won't use it since
turning it on enables it for literally
every single piece of content you
consume including your Morning News
update the tech boy news you
see oh we got our first ad Google Play
gam games are going
big play the official P terrible but
okay essential notifications though I
think this is such a cool feature you
can choose any one of your apps and then
specify any type of notification from
that app that you'd like to Mark as
important that' be useful like to have
it so that my parents phone calls and
text messages come in like with big
blinking lights and other people's like
for example with your emails you can
choose which inbox counts as high
priority or for slack you could say well
it's only really vital if there's an
incoming call and once you've done that
anytime one of those notifications comes
in from that point this glyph will stay
lit up until you next unlock your phone
seems like a battery drainer but
useful wait how do you hold a phone
he's trying to show it to us but yeah
have you ever heard of the saying
there's two kinds of people those that
keep their phone face up and those that
keep their phone face down who says that
and there's also the third person who
doesn't have a phone so they well
choosing a nothing phone is basically
you declaring that you're part of the
Down Club this is designed so that when
you're out at dinner for example you
flip the phone over which can activate
Do Not Disturb mode by the way so
nothing's ringing and you can rest easy
knowing that anything important you'll
still see it it's pretty useful but I
mean we have aods for that but good for
the right person and all the rest of the
notifications well you can get to them
later that concept this of a cheap
budget phone which means it's going to
be like going to like kids and kids
aren't going to Care oh you know let me
let me put my phone down on the table
here like it's not like it's not like
these are gonna be sold in in like
T-Mobile uh stores like that in my mind
is beautiful and something introduced in
the last generation which takes it a
little further is that one of those LT
is also a timer so if you set a stop
that's useful for example you can see
the progress and if you order an Uber
you can see how long to pick up that's
also useful tip it only works in ubu so
it would be work
in well you could get a clear case but
yeah but I mean the phone's have plastic
you don't really need a case I don't
even have a case on my phone because the
dog it all of this sounds amazing what's
wrong with it well while I do like the
idea of looking at the back of your
phone for a notification you're using
most of the information that accompanies
that notification so for example if
you're using this to time your Uber at
some point close to pickup you're going
to need to see the number plate of the
driver who's picking you up so you are
at some point going to have to turn your
phone over yeah yeah that's a screen of
phones are for you know there's a nice
screen on on the front for it and enter
the app anyways or like with emails for
example even though it's very thoughtful
of them that you can set certain inboxes
as priority the problem is that within
any given inbox there's still going to
be vast amounts of variance between the
level of importance of each email that
an LED on the back just can't
distinguish between well yeah but it's
be the same on the screen it's really
dumb to have your emails come on your
phone screen emails and text should not
come on your phone screen when it's
locked okay you should not be able to
read your email and text when it's
locked because people could just send
tofa codes and passw reset codes to your
emails and phone type in the links and
stuff and get in without even having to
hack into your
phone I mean just for an example over
the last few months my emails have
ranged from would you like to take a
flight to the United States to would you
like to take a flight to United States
to interview the CEO of our big tech
company to would you like to test our
rotating makeup rush and pretty clear
one of those is more important than the
other yeah if someone asked me to tested
a rotating makeup bus i' be like yeah
and then go get some kid from school be
like test this and then paid him like a
do and the same is true for messaging
like in theory it makes sense to mark
your parents for example as important
enough to light up the glyph in case
there's an emergency but then the vast
majority of their messages are not going
to require immediate attention and so at
that point are those really essential
notifications after using this for a
little bit of time I imagine most people
will experience enough false positives
messages marked as important that end up
being not very just licked his foot
important when they check them that they
start to tune out this essential
notification glyph and then you like
drain your battery because you have a
big light on your phone just kind of
defeats the purpose of it in the first
place and now you just look like the
fool who left their torch on now I will
admit I have given this whole glyph
thing a bit of SL over the last few
Generations because it's felt like the
rate of improvement was so he doesn't
even talk about the camera battery life
callard you know normal phone things we
still talks about lights
and black wallpapers the Quake that the
next big gamechanging update always felt
just around the corner but this is the
first time that I think I felt that
progress slowing down yes this is a more
affordable phone I have no doubt that
the next Flagship nothing phone will
push the boat out a little bit more but
since their last device like eight
months ago the point where we were
promised developers were about to
suddenly start having their way with
these glyphs we've had support for like
one major new app Google Calendar and
even that's a bit weird it just gives
you like a five minute countdown before
your meeting starts it does work and I
can see the use case but I mean if I was
at dinner and i' flipped my phone over
completely forgetting that I've got an
upcoming meeting I would personally much
rather my phone buzz me like 20 minutes
before to make sure that I knew as
opposed to waiting till 5 minutes before
the meeting and starting a silent
counter just in case he just in case I
look at the light I happen to glance
over in time once again we're uh two
thirds of the way into the video we
still haven't talked about the actual
phone okay this thing could literally be
a LED lamp for like you I mean this
thing can't even can it make phone calls
I'm that show Su since we haven't even
talked about two of using this phone has
made me feel like we might be starting
to reach the limit of what you can do
with LEDs yeah well if you could give
information with LEDs oh oh oh let's see
it' be cool if you could choose to an
email address and phone numbers are
important message email certain color
only uh yeah that would be interesting
except a they're only white LEDs and B
yeah that's the major problem not only
white LEDs um I'm pretty sure you could
f to by email addresses if
you do some stuff like text stuff on it
if you do some automation of routines
doesn't take hours in the Board Room to
figure well multicolor LEDs would cost
more and probably would drain the
battery
more but if you put lots of multicolor
LEDs you could you could do lots of
stuff you can make like an LED American
flag you can make an LED an animation of
uh soldiers watching now that would be a
useful feature like basically an LED
screen on the back of your phone that
can make stuff oh Jan used to go work
for nothing go fly to England and work
for
them I think I think you can send them a
letter maybe you don't read it on
a now maybe if in the future they ex
phones up here
uh there's an actual phone has a dual
screen so you can see yourself and take
like a picture
uh
let me see where's that
image come
on let's see here oh here we go the
xiaomi Mi Ultra 11 I mean look at this
it's an actual screen so you can see
stuff and turn it over and you can take
front facing cameras with the the front
like face pictures with better camera
setup but of course you all know that
feature is probably wasted on kids using
SnapChat at 3 in the morning
uh taking like trash pictures uh like
legitimately trash what like of their
tongues and noses and eyes they can't
even get their whole face in the frame a
secondary tiny display here that could
summarize everything that you needed to
know in a really intelligent concise way
it could become a game changer but as it
stands or like old Samsung phones I
think like the Galaxy Note for Edge
what's at the edge on only one Ed uh
side of screenless the screen was off
and then on the The Tick you could see
stuff come scrolling across that's
pretty useful that's about where the
glyph interfaces useful functionality
ends and if you're enjoying this video
then a sub to the channel would be tag
glyphic this awful hi we're visible the
Wireless company that makes things
visible with us what you see is here we
go so before we tie this all together
the final thing that I want to
crystallize is if took away all the
nothing extras is this oh yes finally we
geted the specs of the phone with 5
minutes left let's get into it let's get
into it so let's take the lights off
let's take the uh oh yeah let's the one
feature take the lights off just
overpriced for what you're getting well
for starters you got the screen this is
a 120 HZ AMOLED full HD Plus display
it's okay it's pretty typical that's
what I have that's what most part phon
have maybe it's for the full HD Plus
there and for the price it's bright it's
smooth it's slick how bright how many
knits you honestly couldn't really
expect better you get the latest Android
14 which again most phones what version
of Android does your phone have janaea
there's already more than most phones in
this bracket yeah most phones in that
bracket might have like Android 13 12
something like that but also you know
you're going to get solid support like
three years of major Android three years
okay okay Samsung does four years for
phones in this price is bracket version
upgrades and four years of security
updates pretty good pretty good because
when your phone stops getting security
updates you can go online you can find
vulnerabilities and somehow get them on
your computer or something and exploit
them uh and hack into people's
phones it's got a chunky 5,000 Milli
battery pretty good typical for Budget
Fone Stu which with which kind of makes
sense because you need the thing to fun
because you know got a little flashlight
on the back of the phone fast 45 W
charging that fully charges in basically
an hour on the dot is a nicely rounded
battery pack again 45 wat charging on a
budget phone pretty good it's not
Supreme battery life possibly cut into
slightly by the glyph lighting and the
extra software that goes into that but
it's good it's a reliable all day phone
and then for performance there's either
12 gigs of RAM and 250 again really good
for the price I mean at any price
honestly my phone doesn't have 2 56 gig
of storage 56 gigs of storage for 349
and then in some regions you can get an
8 GB Ram option for cheaper but that's
paired with the dimensity 7200 Pro
chipset and it's it's actually gotten a
lot faster as I've been using it when I
was first setting up the phone and it
was downloading 100 apps while messing
with the settings and the camera at the
same time it was chug City it definitely
got overwhelmed but as I've settled into
more normal usage and the phones learned
my behaviors it's fine it's fast for the
most part it's smooth for the most part
it plays the games I want to play for
the most part the only reason I'm wait
there's a Mario game
on mobile really let me
see I might download it you know I
actually play a video game who wants to
see a video game uh better not cost any
money I not paying any money for a game
oh man maybe I'll review this I didn't
know this came out Mario Kart
tour who wants to see the tech booy
video game
stream let's see what the comments say
oh no comments yet okay getting it is
because every now and again you do get
reminded that this isn't a top tier
flagship like sometimes when you exit an
app you'll get a bit of lag sometimes
the camera takes a while to load
camera's pretty fast sometimes the
photos when you capture them a while to
process oh that was that was not good
but those things only stand out because
for 95% of the things you do it will
slice through them like butter so then
the only remaining question mark is the
cameras is that why you're here all
right fine go on I'll take one and the
cameras sound good this is two 50 megap
sensors on the back all right all right
attention here see see how say
is I mean Instagram's going to make me
money soon all you want to see one okay
all let's see pay attention he says it
has 50 megapixels probably like your
phone but the center size I mean it's
kind of small so it's probably not going
to take and a 32 megapixel camera for
selfies which is actually quite
refreshing compared to most phones at
this price which try to squeeze like
four cameras onto their phone one will
be some crazy 200 megapixel camera and
then the rest will be like five and you
have that's true this kind of looks like
the LG v no balance but in the end as
far as its actual output I'd say it's
only decent in a way I'm
impressed like the video it cranks out
is on the upper end of what you'd expect
it can take professional photos with
that tasty natural background blur and
the camera app it feels premium I've
never heard to someone refer to a photo
as tasty unless they're talking about
like food in the photo which then not
phone into a photo
itself which does make it feel a little
bit more like you're shooting with a
proper kit the fundamentals are solid
that doesn't look like a proper bit of
Kit to me my phone has a pro mode but
there's just little weaknesses all
around like often times it will apply to
what is
this look at the blue on both sides of
the leaf I mean I guess that's good
there but the edge detection I mean it's
kind of blowing up those edges though to
much of the high dynamic range effect
which is a common shortcut for cheaper
phones because it can make Landscapes
and City shots look instantly more
impressive but often times faces and
hair they suffer because of it
color you think that's a good camera
quality decent I
guess are often exaggerated versus
reality kind of for the same reasons but
more jarringly they aren't even close to
matching between the phone's two lenses
like look how different the wood
paneling looks look at this this look
like a painting and this looks like you
know an actual image it's on the main
camera versus the ultra wide oh yeah and
that Ultra wide even though it is 50
megapixel it doesn't feel it in
day-to-day use it feels distinctly not
very detailed the front camera only
shoots in 1080P there is no 4K and while
that's that's got that's really G to
hurt all those uh all those
ticktockers which I I could kill this
about it's not bad for 1080p you can
tell that it's lacking as far as 2024
standards go and the fact that there is
no zoom lens means both that Zoom shots
aren't going to look too hot also you're
going to struggle to take any kind of
beautifully framed Supernatural looking
portraits now I realized that sounds
like I've had an enormous dunk on these
devices but those are the differences I
feel coming from a flagship phone for
this price the cameras are about what
you'd expect it's middle of the line so
it's you know it's just it's just you
know it's a budget phone with
nice cameras and you know it's basic
going to say for the price it's good so
we got to talk about spy so someone triy
to declare that me so we got to invest
in spy Tech so we we got to look at all
the best uh the best
spy uh equipment here so uh this company
might sponsor me they might send over
something again we reviewed their how
would the Tik tokers make money they
they sent over a device to me uh in the
summer and they might send me one again
I sent them an email today here we go
atto digital voice recorder we got uh
let's look at the technology that we
have here okay we got voice activated
recorders we got like an actual
professional recorder here and we have
where are they oh here here they go here
they go okay let's go up here let's go
up wait are they out of
business oh
no oh no well well they they at least
used to make voice recorders okay you
know our website is actually a a pseudo
Spy website and uh I will you know how
we were trying to get uh
phones to uh use a Bluetooth microphone
as a receiver well there this
application called microphone in the
Play Store and it looks like it sends
Bluetooth audio to your phone speaker un
unfortunately all the bluetooth mics I
have here are also speakers so when I
pair them to my phone the audio comes
through the speaker so it's just like
I'm talking to myself that's a that's a
problem there
um so there there's other technology
here and we're just going to go through
here from Amazon I mean look at this
thing what do you think uh janaa we're
going to pull this up on Amazon this is
some of the best technology that we have
here and this watch this watch is a
disgrace I set it up to record you
record it for 5 seconds and disabl piece
of junk okay absolutely piece of junk
okay and this drone here again I
actually figured out how to get the
cameras to rotate but the application
and stuff again
junk junk so we're going to go through
here and review it in a uh you have any
more questions and then we'll end with
like at 1 hour and 30 1 hour 40 minutes
left of time of of time on the show and
I'll make a thumbnail and be sure to
leave comments and share the podcast
with your friends and also to uh say hi
to AA and if you don't like the podcast
make sure you sh share it with people
you don't like because then maybe they
won't like it I don't know uh oh we are
freezing
okay
uh oh oh no we also need a new laptop I
guess yeah I'm not able to get down to
the bottom
bo uh
oh
no
clusive live stream magic is our hashtag
good for them uh oh we lost
connection thank you oh we're back live
we're back live uh yeah so I guess we
can talk about this next week when you
come back
good night and God bless and God bless
America</pre>
