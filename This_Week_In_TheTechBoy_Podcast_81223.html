<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 81223</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to this week in the
tech boy podcast
in three
two
one where's my music oh there it is so
in three two one
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
hello everybody and welcome to the this
week in the tech boy podcast secure
folders been having some issues over
this weekend we'll tell you how to
um if you can put in the chat if you
have these issues
um I got a real life audio drama project
ish it's supposed to help people with uh
dyslexia we'll see if it's useful and
also best part is doing some weird stuff
so you can take that out all this and
more coming up on this week in the tech
boy podcast this would be a good place
for the intro to go anyway so let's just
first wait and share here I'm going to
tell everyone I'm live
then we'll get right into subscribe
we'll be reacting some stuff and Mr
who's the boss up
uploaded oh dear
I'm live on the checkpoint yet okay so
I'm gonna switch channels here uh okay
anyway
um Miss Tuesday boss uploaded some stuff
so you know we're reacting to that maybe
just a new cell phone view uh
and we're also still sending a TCL 40
Pro XL so if you want that check it out
it's on eBay store 170 dollars
yeah yeah 170 right now
um shipping based on your location and
there's all the proceeds will go to us
will help support the channel
um we're looking into getting an s20
view also because this s280 plus is kind
of slowing down
um
let me just go over here
and
live
oh I forgot
we're here guys I gotta turn off these
lights because then you'll be able to
see my actual nice Studios
standby
oops
oh
there you go
all right see oh adjust my cat speaking
of caps and Texans detectives ones
that's good
hello
everyone all right great we're live and
let's get right into this secure folder
issue that Samsung's having for some
reason it's kind of weird so
and I'm also going to talk about I wish
there's an app like the script we're
going to talk about some Tick Tock uh
oops
I'm going to talk about some tic-tock
problems
um in reactive videos I was supposed to
react to last week but forgot two and
now I have a nice little monologue that
will get clipped because it appears like
our Clips are doing better than our
podcast and hello to viewer number one
welcome please announce yourself in the
chat
here we go
Samsung secure folder it's having a
chrome issue okay I told Google Chrome
and Sam mobile and Samsung I also look
at Samsung support that their phone when
you open in Chrome crashes
both times
so
let's say I have
Google Chrome on a non-secure folder
device right and I open chicken folder
and open Google Chrome
usually I use Samsung internet but for
personal use and Google Chrome for
everything else insecure folder because
it knows all your password to step but I
was opening Google Chrome I undisabled
it because I don't even use it on my
regular
thing and it works but when you open the
skin folder version of Chrome because I
type in Apple or Samsung whatever it
crashes
which isn't good
so yeah Samsung needs to address that
um I'll probably put up an email onto
Samsung members app or something like
that
okay
um
but this issue as far as I know has not
been resolved I need to tell them it
needs to be fixed all right and then we
also had two posts to our X how to embed
Exposed on the website X and it really
looks not showing up this was taught us
because Bray s wanted us to know and
embed Expos on the website and it's
August 10th which means I've had this
phone for about let's say September so
we're gonna film about nine months
um yesterday was my name of anniversary
I basically got this feeling about the
same time I've had this Thanksgiving
weekend so like the 22nd and this phone
here it has been overheating a lot uh
not overheating but like getting really
hot I know it's hard outside but it's
still pretty good I'm getting fat when I
use it outside it feels a bit kind of
lagging I don't know it's running out of
storage too because no expandable
storage only 120 gigabytes and since the
camera's good I'm taking more pictures
than usual it's an okay phone the
pictures are good but I just wish it had
a little more to it I'm I'm looking into
getting something for Galaxies that's
right we're pushing selling devices such
as the
tcl40xl which has 4G uh 120 hertz
play
it doesn't think we're together guys
doesn't think it was scary so it depends
on what you like you want a big screen
you don't know who to display
good okay performance or whatever it's
not the best but 470 dollars
I say let's let's go for it support the
channel you can buy
comes with everything in the Box comes
with the charger comes with the
charging cable
what's up you know look which is better
that way you know I'm giving you the
charger in the charger cable better than
Samsung or Iphone and I wait till we get
to the really juicy stories we don't
have like one person coming to the
channel
and don't forget another way you can
support the channel is by asking us for
oops I forgot to take that space off but
oh yeah
um
we'll do sponsored interviews and posts
like this one so to check it out put
them in the chat you know it's part of
my job that's it promote this
and there we go and before we get to
today's Best Buy store we have a YouTube
story
um we're going to do an old-fashioned
Windows versus Mac OS
um comparison
from Mr Boss
is waiting for it to load I don't know
where to arrive exactly this slow oh
there's a link to that
board thing was just from Analytics
oh wow I'm Excuse the boss is almost at
16 million subscribers so here we go
maybe we can do this I
oh we need to talk about the new one you
write 6.0 beta 2. I need to run another
store that sells so last week my
teammate Joseph decided he wanted to
become an editor I wanted to get him the
best computer to be able to handle it
his teammate or team member Blitz but it
was a bit of a dilemma yeah we couldn't
decide whether to go with Mac or Windows
it turns out me and Aquarius
360p remember that this episode
oh in 2023 there are now vast
differences between what the two can do
oh hello we got our first visit to hello
how are you today
uh
uh taxa I know you DW fans over there
are going to be extremely excited we'll
be back soon
post
and I still need to cash out on that
money you sent me
um
and speaking of that any people
listening is like what money are you
talking about we're talking about uh to
buy me a coffee here's my first sponsor
about buying both kinds of machines so
that we can test them and figure out
which is actually better oh yeah and
this video is oh speaking of video
editing remember last week I was talking
about how the AI on
the AI or what you call DaVinci Resolve
DaVinci Resolve I downloaded it I
downloaded last night I was like okay
I'm gonna use these AI transcribing
features and stuff and guess what you
have to pay to unlock the AI stuff so
it's just like a normal video editor in
in fact all those clips you saw from
this week with me clipping up I didn't
know the butterfly video oh guys look
I'm clipping up this uh what was that
that gardening video
um all those are done in my phone I do
not Video Edit on my laptop anymore I
just use this for big screens go and
like inspect I guess cyber security
stuff anyway back to Mr spross
being edited by Joseph using the
computer we choose so you'll be
um first thing here he's going to get to
it but the screen
up looks better than the windows thing
unless you I will give it but Windows
fit but I guess it's just because all
these icons like you got Chrome
PowerPoint Opera Drive aren't there so
just let's clean it and since it's more
dull colors and this is more Vibe it
looks more vibrant
so our total budget was 1600 pounds here
in the UK which if you go for Mac allows
you to get the absolute highest end new
1600 pounds I wonder why do they go
after 14 it's macro let's see 16.
to dollars that is
yeah it's two thousand dollars I'm
pretty sure you can get a Mac
yeah you can get a MacBook Pro for two
thousand dollars I don't know the
storage requirements maybe we can look
at that later but I mean the pro I I saw
in a video from snazzy Labs today is
better than the air so
all right I don't know when I got that
maybe you want it branded or something
15 inch MacBook Air that currently
exists and with this same budget you
could also afford to go for one of the
very best on the Windows Edge so this is
the 2023 Dell XPS 15. and I gotta say
all right um by the way this guy whoever
this new guy is editing it I have no
idea where you should be best on the
Windows Edge so this is the 2023. why is
he using that fine like this looks like
stuff I got in like coil
and I gotta say I've unboxed a lot of
Windows laptops in my time this is one
of the best presentations I've ever seen
as always the Apple unboxing experience
is not generous but quality love the
braided magnetic cable which is also I
mean that's nice I'm not gonna
just oh I am
but why is it in Cosmic Comics to
announce color match 2 whichever laptop
you pick and then a couple of manuals
and stickers and the wall adapter the
Dell's power cable is a little less
pretty sorry
these wall adapters from a US
perspective we don't have this the
little USB hub that gives you an HDMI
and one full-size USB and
uh the other side of the cable this this
is a brick all right so anyways it's
peel time always my favorite moment
I'm sure that the quality of the
presentation of Apple products is a big
part of why so many people give them as
gifts they're also like high appeal I
think everyone wants well not everyone
we we technology up here want Androids
and windows but most people want
Apple but in this particular case I
think it's been bested in the unboxing
experience very slightly interesting I
was using the Windows Vista Windows 7
logo and
um it's probably from the same era buy
the Dell XPS 15. now as far as build
quality goes my preconception was that
the MacBook could be a noticeable step
up every MacBook I've used in the last
10 years has felt structurally
unbreakable with their 100 aluminum
enclosures and very few individual Parts
whereas I've used a lot of even
expensive Windows laptops made of cheap
wow look at the porch on it
oh my gosh
this guy who's editing the videos using
basic transition she just used a star
transition plastic that literally starts
creaking the moment you take them out
the box I'm pretty sure we have the same
video editing ex office but that's not
really the case here the XPS 15 is
machined aluminum paired with a carbon
fiber Palm rest it's got these really
snazzy glossy accents on the sides the
hinges of it uh to my viewers what do
you guys think about this editing
doesn't this look like something I could
do no if it's this guy but I mean he
just spent like
two yeah four thousand dollars on my
laptop for you well two laptops between
preseason Center back but
like I'm pretty sure he could do better
oh let's see I got a message
I'm going to say that oops oh thanks bad
um
um please answer questions while I'm
chatting but there you go
all right and what do you think this is
editing the top two both very firm and
can be opened most important I mean if
he's just the first time I've ever
editing something
possibly with a minimal fingering and
while both laptops will make a little
bit of noise if you apply a lot of
pressure because the material is so thin
neither feels like they're about to fall
apart anytime soon so we'll give them a
draw the Dell does have more ports
though and you'll tend to find this on
Windows versus math in general
considering it's such a slim laptop it's
by more important it means oh there's
like three usbcs
it'd be cool to see them fit in not just
three Ultra fast USBC ports but also an
SD card and a security Lockport to chain
it to a desk compared to just the two
usbcs and no card slots that you get on
the Mac as a general rule Apple goes for
Ultra minimalism in everything they do
so you'll tend to stay on the map as a
general rule Apple goes for Ultraman
again not trying to criticize the guy
but
why is there a space between all so to
be a Dasher or something Ultra animalism
in everything they do so you'll tend to
get exactly what they think you'll need
and nothing extra so in a very surface
level way Windows takes the ports
category it'd be funny if this is us if
you're doing like a Microsoft Surface
Studio or something me too but it's not
a whitewash there's a couple of
redeeming factors for this near portless
Mac one that instead of using a USBC
charger it uses magsafe which I way
prefer there are USBC Maxi style cables
when produced today
snaps into place it feels satisfying but
most importantly if you accidentally
walk into it it's less likely to pull
your laptop off the table with it and
shatter it into Oblivion this is what
happens if you walk into the Dell cable
and cover the floor embedding because I
do not trust this
standby
it's a pretty snazzy it's a little twirl
at the end two that the Apple charger is
this nice tidy thing that you can fit in
a pocket which is
who carries your laptop
um chat chat do you carry your oh man
you have to go oh anyway
um bye
um but do you carry your laptop charger
if you're in your pocket just checking
you know could be a
England thing I don't know is it only
possible because if our apples
engineered their laptops to have lower
power requirements compared to the Dell
brick which is literally like lugging a
whole second Gadget around with your old
times and then three the fact that when
you do literally like lugging a whole
second Gadget around with you all times
and then three the fact that when you do
plug your Dell in because the charger is
USBC you are losing one of the three USB
ports that you could have used for
something else
yeah losing an essential break degraded
Windows land but it just gives you two
USBC ports
which is what the apple is so still at
winter then you turn them on and you're
faced with the components that you're
gonna oh
foreign
[Music]
looking at the screens and for this the
Mac is quite a bit sharper Windows
laptops tend to stick to Industry
standard resolutions which in most cases
is 1920x1080 or in this case 1920 by
1200 but apple pays very little
attention to what the number itself is
and instead just focuses on making what
they call a retina display a resolution
such that from the distance you'll be
viewing any screen from you shouldn't be
able to see any individual pixels so
you'll end up with some strange sounding
resolution numbers like in this case
2880 by 1864 but hey I mean in the end
that is two and a half times the number
of people yeah I can kind of some pixels
on my 1080p yes infinity plus now so
pixels versus the Dell plus you can
probably tell this even through the
camera the fact that it's a glossy
screen also helps with the way that it
represents color is it a two and a half
times better screen no there are
definitely let's see let's see
your skin looks less
wait washed out and this is like the
lights all on them you can still see
some color tones here
um both iPhones look the same
oh wait I think it's dramatic
that's why I look at it again he's still
I don't know he looks kind of red on
that one
um
what do you guys think I mean what do
you think it's my color definitely
diminishing returns to having more
all right since I pause at the same time
both screens are just as bright as each
other and I obviously prefer the
bezel-less look why is he using Firefox
I thought he was like sponsored by
Europe or something anyway but the Dell
XPS 15 has going on as opposed to
Apple's dreaded Notch but the Mac is
still a little better here and I suppose
if you are going to have a notch then at
least you'd benefit from it on the
MacBook with apple having more room to
slide in a better webcam so this is the
Dell's webcam it's uhp have a look at
this
it's uh pretty bad
yeah like the way it's representing the
skin tones I look ill you look pretty
ill
and this is the Mac which is 1080P and
that's one factor that definitely makes
it look better but it's not just a
resolution thing like the skin tones
look better the exposure is more
consistent the background behind us
actually looks like the background
behind us what are you doing
oh yeah and then there's an icing on the
cake you're also going to sound better
on the map the audio has a level of
richness to it which the Dell lacks this
one very much sounds like you are using
an inbuilt microphone one thing that
very few people seem to consider when
they buy a new laptop but that they
really should is the keyboard I actually
managed to give myself a pretty severe
repetitive strain injury last year from
using a keyboard that had a high level
of impact I don't think this will be an
issue for everyone but we have a second
viewer welcome welcome please come and
join the chat if you feel like you are
susceptible to this then I would
slightly Veer away from the map I'd say
that Apple generally just doesn't like
their keyboards to be in any way at all
squishy so they make it quite a sharp
clicky key press
well I mean
I guess now Apple cares about keyboards
there was a time
long ago
when they didn't
with minimal cushioning that makes it
nicer to use it's more satisfying than
the noticeable springiness that you get
wait what is that
wow look at that you have all the little
like the pound keys for quids and stuff
which
wait that's a different keyboard here
his quotation marks on the tube on mine
I have an ad symbol
he has the American dollar or I guess
any dollar symbol the percent sign
that's interesting [ __ ]
excuse me it's still a quality layout
yeah in the Dell's keyboard but it is
also conducive to more hand strain maybe
it's just different manufacturers so
don't spend a long time typing to be
honest either way if you use your laptop
at home then you're better off just
going for a proper ergonomic mouse and
keyboard like this stuff is from the
Logitech Ergo range because clawing your
hand around a trackpad all day is also
not the best for you but if you had to
then between these two just like the
keyboards Apple's trackpad is the nicer
one to use now don't get me wrong it's
great that Windows is caught up a lot
when it comes to how you can use your
trackpad to fluidly interact with your
machine but this is something that feels
really satisfying and intentional about
the Mac click which the Dell just
doesn't have it feels like a dull Hollow
press with a hint of something loose
inside so it's pretty neck and neck so
far a couple more Hardware comparisons
before we get in well
I mean the Dells
practically losing two to four since
unboxing oh okay guys guys
so we got the uh s23 Ultra and we have
the iPhone 14 pro um the unboxing is
what really matters it's it's much on
the outside that counts
then it's the juicy software comparisons
okay one thing that you can be sure of
on any current MAC system is that that
is a
speakers microphone that's supposed to
simulate you see the ear molding there
will not be bad I mean the ones on my
16-inch MacBook Pro are easily some of
the best laptop speakers on the market
and the ones on this air they're not as
good but they're also not far off it
doesn't have any massive speaker grilles
like the Dell does and all the sound
comes out of this Gap here so it's
actually being bounced off the screen
towards you as opposed to coming
directly at but it is a six-speaker
sound system compared to the Dell's quad
speaker and let's listen to the
difference 2021 has been an unbelievable
ride I'm still in physical shock and
what we've managed to do this year it
sounds pretty good and it feels that the
audio has space because of the fact that
you have larger speaker grills but the
first thing I noticed when I listen to
that is that my voice doesn't sound how
it should sound so this is the Mac 2021
has been an unbelievable ride for the
mysteries of the boss Channel I'm still
in physical shock at what we've managed
to do this year okay so you might have
been able to hear here that the audio
feels a little more cramped
voice feels spot on and also it's just a
little cleaner now whether that's the
fact that this whole laptop is made of
aluminum and therefore there's less
micro vibrations to disrupt the intended
sound or just an audio algorithm on
Apple's end I've got to hand it to them
in that the result speaks for itself
Okay so we've just looked it up and
Microsoft's YouTube channel is on 1.12
million subscribers which means they're
getting absolutely smashed by Apple just
like we are but we're actually gaming on
them so if you want to help us get there
then the sub to the channel would be
delightful
bucks maybe the biggest Hardware
question of them all is performance if
you spend the same amount of money on
Mac or Windows which one actually gets
you the faster machine and it's a more
confusing question
oh my goodness speak I'm trying I almost
forgot I made a promise to my ntp people
that I'm gonna make an NTB flag so
which one actually gets you the faster
machine
what is that and it's a more confusing
question than it's ever been before
because Apple doesn't use off-the-shelf
parts anymore there used to be a day
where Macs and windows would both have
the same Intel processors and the same
in video or AMD graphics and life was
easy but almost everything Apple uses
now is custom that said I don't think
it's a stretch to say that on the spec
front windows feels like a clear winner
I mean you have a 13th gen Intel Core i7
which has 14 cores and can go all the
way up to five gigahertz compared to
just eight CPU cores that can go up to
3.5 if you get 16 gigabytes of RAM eight
plus one terabyte aside phone is eight
gigas right but it is solid state
storage which is again double what
you're getting on the air for the same
price it's nice
and providing that you're in that
applications that can take advantage of
that power you'll see the difference
like open up a CPU benchmarking app like
geekbench and you can very clearly see a
35 higher multi-core score I wonder if
you paid the licensing because you can't
use geekbench like the app in the Play
Store
um for commercial purposes unless you
pay so I wonder if that's a client if
you want every type of video storage
speed test and the SSD in the Dell will
come out on top only slightly though and
running a game even though this Dell is
using Intel's own Graphics which are not
the best you'll get like 20 higher
frames per second so that should be it
right Windows takes it away well
the numbers aren't the full story for
the vast majority of your day-to-day
tasks we are long past the point where
the limiting factor is your Hardware
it's all about software and the perk of
Apple making their own chips is that
they can build software around that
Hardware so it's basically the iPhone
though it's more optimized so if you do
your work or you can do your work with
Apple apps like pages and keynote and
Safari some code
then editing ones like final cut those
Apple apps will perform extremely well
on the M2 Apple chip that this thing has
guys in in the podcast uh live do your
work
if you have the choice be sure to use
Microsoft Google or Apple applications
like legally office
with leaves right I mean I'm useful for
Trucking but but what apps do you use
like would you switch to make
actually better than any Windows
counterparts because like I mean Dell
doesn't have any say at all about how
programs are specifically optimized for
the selection of Hardware that it
chooses oh yeah well we got Stamp Set
it's a pretty big company producer they
can talk to Microsoft and the biggest
part of this Which flies so far under
the radar is that because the power
requirements of Apple's Hardware are so
much lower
stays fast when you take the cable out
Windows laptops not so much as a matter
of fact just
this cable without changing any of the
power management settings turns a 35
performance win into a 40 loss and on a
laptop who's entitled I mean might as
well get a PC
my purpose is to be portable that's a
big deal so I'll call this overall very
broad performance category for draw and
that's a good segue to be a better of
our performance but Apple's more
efficient I guess you could say which I
think overall efficiency of this thing
this Mac is silent it doesn't have a fan
because these Apple made chips the M2 in
this case are based on phone chips which
have had even less room for calling than
laptops they allow the MacBook to boot
up almost instantly and the battery is
that boot up I was interested I just saw
a couple of X cleats battery life is the
single biggest Advantage the max in 2023
have over windows I mean to give you an
idea of an average holiday might get you
yeah
this Dell will actually be above average
it'll get you seven or so the 15 inch
MacBook Air can come out 10 to 12. and
because do you think I should get a Mac
guys in the chat do you think I should
switch to make
as the Windows laptops also have to have
so much larger batteries to even try and
keep up their bulkier and it takes
longer
to charge them oh my goodness look
oh look at this so we talked about this
apple brick this is a 30 watt charger
which is not by any stretch of the
imagination generous from Apple I mean
I've got phone chargers with three times
the wattage but still this thing can you
have to spin up the laptop battery
like that fully charged the MacBook in
140 minutes there's an optional 70 watt
brake that can do it in 80 but the doubt
even with all of this which is like
bigger than Milo's face takes about 150
which puts it very behind overall in the
efficiency category but okay it's time
to shift gears to the software so the
Mac is running Mac OS Venture uh it was
a good edit I did I was a good edit
Windows 11 both will do the same core
computer things but just with each
having a couple of their own clear perks
if you're used to Mac it never really
feels like subscribe to the windows is
D1 if you're someone who really wants to
get into the guts of your system to make
it yours if you want themes easy you
want a Legend of Zelda wallpaper that
reacts depending on where you hover your
mouse sure you want to make it look like
a Mac you can do that too on Windows
looks like Windows takes the
customization point so just with a
slight caveat that Scrolls without any
customization Mac OS is the prettier one
I guess the one upside or a lack of
customization is order like the file
explorer feels less cluttered apps have
more design consistency because Apple
forces them to all work in a certain way
if they want to be on Mac and well
do they though
like
and also never really got installing the
link
like just a web app oh yeah Discord
um
do you later like I mean you can just
download a Mac app online What's App
it's a very clear priority on it so we
got Photoshop DaVinci Resolve Spotify
slack I have no idea what that is
Photoshop again and setting animations
which makes the Mac feel less like a
tool more like a hit nice nice like an
experience the other upside to this
control
stability the fact that Windows is made
for everyone from the extreme gamer with
their colossal twenty thousand dollar
rig today a person who just wants to
make their TV smart with a literal stick
the size of a finger means that there's
just a lot of room oh beside the
internet I saw this thing about like the
best gaming laptops under 200.
uh that's nothing as you get on it
because someone off like no there's no
best gaming wrapped up under 200 but I
think it's gonna barely too long
and after this one I show off the
MacBook Pro rooms to encounter
unexpected problems not to mention the
Apple authors a lot more of the
experience whereas on Windows you have
to rely on third-party developers making
their own drivers which tell your
computer how the hardware is yeah
they get it wrong and then the cherry on
top for all this control is that Macs
are harder to penetrate
the viruses they're not invulnerable
like I've heard a lot of people say but
there is less malware out there for them
because I mean if you're a hacker you're
going to want to build your hacking
tools to Target the operating system
that has the most number of users so
window yeah I think it's like 13. maybe
20 now because
because Chromebooks and because Windows
is so widespread across countries and
versions and devices it naturally has
more vulnerabilities for hackers to
exploit speed is a bit of a weird one
on one hand this is where you really
feel the benefit of an operating system
that lets you do whatever you want like
with Windows the fact that you can snap
Windows into full screen and half screen
is so much quicker than on Mac where
Apple's basically just said no and
instead you're left there fiddling with
your windows manually until they're
exactly 50 50. but on the other hand the
lack of customization on Max allows for
more optimization the software feels
like less of a burden on them than
Windows can and they tend to be able to
perform better with equivalent Hardware
compared to Windows plus they age better
you tend to find that Windows computers
get very clogged up over time with the
mountains of Windows updates so they
Chuck at you and the file fragmentation
that occurs as you install more and more
programs Max do also slow down to some
extent as new updates introduce new
complexities but it's not been nearly as
noticeable in my experience here's the
key thing that I'd say it boils down to
though well actually first you can't get
a new Mac for anything less than a
thousand dollars or so so up until that
price Windows is your answer yeah but
there's plenty of refocus strikes we're
going to look at the 14 inch Mac Pro by
default but then between a thousand and
two thousand dollars I think for Mac as
a general light Computing device feels
like a more light Computing device for a
thousand dollars are you kidding me
jurious experience than an equivalently
priced windows in that I think Apple
prioritizes the little things that add
up like the sound and the feel of the
trackpad the Stellar Hardware
construction and apple also optimizes
its own apps in a way that Windows
hasn't yet found a way to compete with
but the Mac lacks compatibility this is
the single biggest redeeming quality of
Windows compatibility with a lot of work
programs especially those involving
servers and also games if you want a
game in any serious capacity on your
computer the choice is made for you
you'd instead use this 1600 pounds to
specifically buy a Windows gaming laptop
like this Rog strip associating Windows
is more specialized yes I guess it's for
everyone in it's more specialized but
I'm wondering why he can get the 14 inch
MacBook Pro for about the same price we
said to two thousand dollars USD but you
got 16 units memory 512 gigabytes of
storage you've got more RAM but the same
room storage faster charging when it's
smaller screen but you get more approach
you get HDMI and Microsoft equals right
three Thunderbolt four points and get
Max save so you get more purchased in
the Windows laptop
excuse me that's already magic keyboard
um
of course Process reviews
like I I don't know I didn't get this
and I can get Final Cut appropriate
detection pretty soon
I it doesn't make sense so what do you
think do you think that you should have
got an F14 which Mac Pro or the 15 inch
MacBook Air I'm the reason I'm saying
this because I saw a video that said to
get this accepted but maybe we wanted
something new and why was the name of
that they're on laptop I mean it's
probably down in the description as an
affiliate link
XPS 15 and let's let's check that okay
so the final verdict was Windows but
wait what taking an XPS 15 for 1500 US
dollars maybe the import fees iOS I
don't know
um let's see here
um 13th gen Intel a project that I won
5G coach processor or you can get the I9
which I guess
okay see you can get a four gigabytes
graphics card 16 gigabytes 12. oh he got
the terabyte version which changes the
price to
daughter
okay
um I mean about a hundred dollars so
let's see where we got here let me just
make that up
oh yeah we've got two USBC ports here
a usb-c port there here USBC there USBC
everywhere
but you know it isn't nice
Segways but anyway did you know what is
a base
bye because they're doing something
weird
and then we'll start making a flag oh
wait oh I almost forgot about this we're
gonna talk about Sam Bateman free
this guy is going to jail
Sam Bateman freed is heading to jail
after a judge accuses him of witness
tampering in his massive fraud case and
revoked his belt interesting so he
was an ex billionaire who scammed people
with extremes FTX which I think I had a
Super Bowl ad in 20 treatment
22 I think in February 2022
um
and he is going to jail it's even in the
house arrest
uh but he's going to jail because he
tried to interfere with
Witnesses twice
and gave documents to reporters he hit
over the line and instead of saying in
his 300 he will be staying in the
Metropolitan Detention Center in
Brooklyn
so yeah crypto scale SPF will be going
to jail and
also
um there's also this
dangerous I guess it's kind of thing
dangerous ish
um new AI software developed by people
in England because of course I'm just
kidding
um let me scroll down it allows you and
I kid you not to be able to hear what
the words are
from passwords wait sorry
is that you
you type in your password I guess each
key press has a different sound wave and
um so each sound wave sounds slightly
different and because it sound waves are
on slightly different they cannot figure
out which key you're pressing which
means you should be using this this
keyboard and excuse box showed off it
was a keyless keyboard I'll show it to
you anyway researchers of trade AI let's
do your password if I listen to your
type because why not
so each password
in this perfect space that listens to
you type
into deep learning and it it has a 93
accuracy when using Zoom the training
system which is kind of dangerous
because in you know people are starting
over 93 accuracy that that's enough to
put into Crunch and start throwing this
away and just I guess recording it over
like locally not over Zoom it's a 95
accuracy which is even crazier so
I guess the smart thing to do is to use
a password manager and just
click that I mean if they have they had
to do that I mean maybe maybe you can
figure out what your password is just by
looking at you I mean there was an
article about fixing not so much
political affiliation by looking at
their face so maybe extrapolate the
status of that or something
um yeah so
I guess I'm going to start the line on
this random passwords anyway just more
after that yeah I used to before all
right and before we get to our Best Buy
story who isn't really the best and you
probably wouldn't buy it as a stock
we got this and you say what is this and
I say it's the stick I used to unbox
stuff well I tried to use it when I
unbox my pin but it didn't work so I
opened this up set it up right and try
to put my phone in it I had to put this
on backwards but it goes over I guess in
our boxes back
but my phone was too top heavy and since
there's nothing back there it's a it
can't go through anything back there it
didn't work unfortunately so I'm going
to have to I'm pretty sure
did it like return deadline is
eliminated so I'm gonna have to like put
this down and for Audio Only listeners
podcasts and there you go ahead and
bring sunglasses oh we're getting time
to move faces I'm coming in also um the
plane people who think that they're
gonna get like I asked if they're going
to do something we got the TVs to walk
the talkies
um they're supposed to be coming in soon
and we also got some spankings like
recording and stuff so that's nice and
now let's get to that Best Buy story I
have been hinting at
um let me just search for Best Buy and
I'll actually do something in the
leadership's going on or something
um yeah so Best Buy I would do a month
ago there's a vlog about it check it out
uh this shows some articles
ah there we go
according to not the B they're facing a
uh I guess not according to Matthew just
reporting on it according to the O'Keefe
Media Group formerly the guy who used to
work for project Veritas
um facing a boycott over often
leadership programs sorry uh displays
that's it X post my X from The Blaze
best price using a boycott are from
leadership resistance that are only
available to non-write employees so I
guess it's good for me congratulations
um we're still going to screenshots of
knowledge internal Facebook company demo
to do Keith Media Group and these are
the pictures oh which is taking it
oh okay I'll just zoom in here we go
professional development programs in
2023 I'm just making a little difference
I think uh 2023 we're launching a three
news program it's called leadership
Essentials first individual
contributions and these are the
requirements made you must be working
there you must have worked one one year
at current world at Best Buy and you
must identify black Latino Hispanic
Asian or Pacific Islander
pretty sure you're missing some stuff
see but what if you
guess
I'm producing me
I don't know Middle Eastern
okay anyway you must be able to
commitment but that's not the important
stuff and this is how you sign up it's a
like a forum here you need to
which code it didn't ask you which code
do you identify with latino is in a
Pacific Islander so it looks like Best
Buy is gonna get uh boy boy uh Cottage
over Twitter so you know guys all my
Foods people
I guess stop going to Best Buy I don't
know I guess I can walk in just don't
find it some of the toys of advice
anyway
if you have a protest or something I
don't know
um anyway yeah so Best Buy
unfortunate for my Best Buy
but sad not that's it I'm pretty simple
don't make it and if they don't make it
don't just be like most
after
like fries run out of business
lots of other people went out of
business so it's not it's not like Best
Buys it's just the last and a long line
and as we make an audio drama reference
it's time to talk about the scan marker
reader and I'm actually going to finish
my review with you guys live on here I'm
gonna talk about Tick Tock thing here
anymore probably French receptionally
active because we still have plenty of
podcasts
um left so I want you to hear this uh
clip
um and then you will
you will listen to this clip
excuse me and then anyone like the clip
understand
and if you don't like the clip
boom something nothing bad's gonna
happen to you in that way okay I'm
getting my screen recording soon
okay
here we go this is a clip from Kids
Corner listen friends and it's
describing a device that the protagonist
Liz received for his birthday in one of
the video episodes and it could okay
we're gonna have to use MC converter
remember MC converter the tool I showed
off to I'm gonna have to convert the
screen recording that I will use to
record the audio on the phone to record
to upload they're thinking and stuff so
I'm just going to keep talking guys I
can vote
um it's taking a long time and do you
guys like MC converter I'm pretty sure
too do you remember my review about MC
converter
wanna see me
yes who's watching by the way you've
been quiet
so please church
but don't feel threat
of course I'm gonna convert it to MP3
so there we go
it's uploading anyone from 7.3 or 6375
86 money and done oh do you think maybe
it's a tester
for Windows
test it out I tried to install Windows
co-pilot
all right click it downloaded I think
it's installed like that app that's huge
time anyway all right so we're adding
the file this this is about the
protagonist which is receiving this
first birthday
so Stanford uploading and
done all right listen
listen take us
hello and
second but it's not just any pain huh
it's a whiz kids 2000. oh Wizkid 2000.
oh come on don't act like you never
heard of the wk2k before this yeah still
not acting oh man it's really cool
wk2k is a pen with a little adboard
scanner and a micro dictionary chip oh
no we're riding along it gets stuck on a
word push this button
and the correct spelling shows up in
this little window screen you can even
scan a full page of text for no to
export it to your computer's word
practice translates into three languages
all right so the wk2k scanning onboard
um pin
you know you know it sounds like it's
technologically feasible and it's what
you would get if you strap this to a pin
in the computer I mean explain so this
is the stand marker reader I thought I
was getting a scan worker but I got the
scan my computer and it has the same
function as the skin marker air except
it doesn't do any of those Advanced
smooth processing but it does have a
dictionary and I'm going to show you
what it can do so
is a few Supply we connect this to the
think I did some testing
um over the
oh my God I can't say weekend but I did
some testing and it works out well
um you'll see the article come out
probably today
about to use to connect it and
you can't sell this with them
oh well looks like I'm going to use
Bluetooth
some generic micro USB cable all right
so I'm gonna turn it on
I'm going to go to app that
scanworker.com
there's no
uh desktop app the only app they have is
for Windows iOS devices
and I'm going to
share this with you
[Applause]
advice
Bluetooth nothing exciting or anything I
haven't actually used this before
I only used it I use a Bluetooth on my
phone but I haven't used it
the heck was that anyway
let me see how do you pair of Bluetooth
again I forgot let's see
it's blinking
services on
hold it down one one thousand two one
thousand three hundred
right definitive thing is blinking
I'm trying to edit the face
but it's not fun to get and that's not
good because sometimes I have to get a
microwave
yeah that means I got to get up and
leave you guys and I don't want to leave
you guys in the cold dark podcast well
all alone
um
I cannot find my destiny micro USB side
cables which is one of the sad things
for USBC USBC would have been
but a data transfer better
which is better I guess oh
you're big all right got a micro USB
cable I'm gonna plug it into you
look at this go
[Music]
um
plugged it in all right I'm gonna share
my tab with you guys
here we go
so I'm going to connect my scanner to it
if you can see this orange screen
welcome to Potion number two again
please feel free to chat
all right I'm going to connect to my
scanner
USB cable
got it
look better where the face is found
let me connect again
oh no maybe this USB cable doesn't
support that eventually that is bad all
right okay so I'm gonna have to find it
right let's see Bluetooth
got it it's asking me to appear with my
YouTube's not turning on
all right I just finished that stupid
thing
it was actually turned it up okay the
Bluetooth light LED is beeping all right
see here hope you can see it on screen
see this
okay got it it says pins game hopefully
you can see that I clicked pair
and it says I'm successfully connected
all right so this is our Bluetooth
scanning pin I did an unboxing on it so
I'm just going to call this it's a scan
Markle at the wk2k
um it comes with an attachment that
helps you scan stuff better and since
it's for people with dyslexia I guess
people are people who help seeing stuff
I guess this makes more sense so we're
gonna help reverse my interview but I
thought you might like to see it in
actions
so I'm gonna put my
thing about here I'm on like verse 14.
um and then we're going to go to the
scan Market website
and you'll be able to see
the textual thing there you go
you hold it at a 90 degree angle I know
you can't see and the light comes on
there's no sound
let's make rooms in the ark and cover it
inside and slash a
pretty good I'll demonstrate it again
and it Regional allowed in the text is
bigger you can make it as big as you
want look it's or in any font you want
which
I mean that's really good for someone
with uh dyspepsia
um but but the downside of this is
the downside of this is
like your phone's Google lens can do
this stretch right in between
and cheaper
your toes two around
but I mean I guess this is more tactile
it gives a more your heel really I just
sprayed uh experience
you just want to go in a simple as
needed first glue the equals uh it's
supposed to be in strips but okay
in strips together and it's it's reading
it as like an equippable applicable uh
speed and it also has uh translate
something air addiction so if you want
to use the dictionary you go click this
here and you know I guess you can type
it in if you want it's like a regular
dictionary but you can also take your
pin and you'll click
and I'm actually going to turn the
camera on for this
okay
[Applause]
you'll be able to take your pit your
your magazine or pin or whatever and see
how it says utility knife and make our
own changes to half and half
uh oops
shift three okay
uh okay whatever oh it's not letting me
actually as good as it's gonna get all
right so watch on the screen has a
search forward right and if you can't
sit on the screen really well it says
the word I'm about to highlight is knife
so I'm going at it and I need to do it
in here
really fast
and
oh there it is knife a utensilator is
designed for cutting a flat piece is a
hard metal used to still order metal the
blades usually sharpen or one Edge
attached to a handle if they need to
point it for a piercing okay
and I think I also found some video for
it
a utensil yeah it reads the description
for you so it could be everything useful
for people with dyslexia now one what
would just put the scare Mark I would
say is
Peru
because
it can also it can export stuff to Word
documents you don't have to use
app.scanmarker.com which means I'm
guessing uh Bluetooth slash
uh USB connection
means it doesn't have to
um be connected to the internet all the
time but the internet allows it to read
stuff
you can dictate stuff and find stuff so
they have it our very own WK I want to
see the address on that magazine maybe
UK
2k not to be confused
um great
so we're going to finish a review
on blogspot and you can help me do this
it's my first ever crowdsource review
and hello two person number three is
watching the stream please check because
we like hearing from you guys
oops sorry about that guys I
accidentally left deleted my chat who's
nervous about that guys guys come back
come back into the chat all right
um
here we go these are my blogger posts
this is what my editing stuff looks like
so we're going to be talking about the
scan marker um Pro Scan Mark I did send
this to me at a discounted price to view
okay this is the official marketing
image here this is coming here so I can
call it the video because it's going to
text aloud and you can even export text
into the word processor
and I say it sounds like an amazing
device for high school seniors seniors
and but I mean you can export the text
into word processor you can copy and
take the text that was the internet my
digital word processor that you saw
there and then there's keys on the site
that you export
okay okay so I think I'm going to fix
this this this
um
um thing okay I'm gonna say however it
does happen
because it's gonna have also the
the Logitech text allows it to be easier
to read and probably can't see this
also the Logitech starts to be easier to
read
hmm
in the tactile and the reason I looked
up the scan Market was because
uh because of that episode so
and I'm going to talk about the pawn in
my next
Odyssey Vlog spot boy.blogspot.com and
comedy laws are kind of weird I also
talked about that everything we'll see
tactile
tactileness of
skin my achy is kind of weird
how many stars do you guys it gets three
out of three and a half
three and a half Stars what do you guys
think let's see oh my third person came
back all right so we're talking about
the um about the person who came back
talking about the scanner Market reader
what do you think three and a half
swords four stars you give the range
rating and we will buy buy it but now
here comes the most fun segment of the
show we're going to be talking about how
idiot Tick Tock teams even more idiot
last time I haven't watched this video
so hopefully there's no Bear Lodge in it
but
um we'll just like scan the transcript
and skip over them Okay so
he won't leave Tick Tock teams or
sitting around
and doing nothing
and the trend
because
you know
say
okay I'm gonna give my full thoughts if
I see this video it might be less dumb
the night sounds
just because it sounds insanely dumb and
I have a nice dark blue little thing
that I'm gonna say and then I'm gonna
get clipped I'm gonna clip it myself
see
scamming through oh there it is
eight days ago
11 minute video
man
okay
here you go shoot his tab instead
[Music]
it seems that every week we hear about a
new tick tock Trend they always have a
different name they're always annoying
and weird in slightly different ways but
the one thing that most of them have in
common is that they are very thinly
veiled excuses for being lazy true
um
I'll link a video where I talk about
quiet quitting which is just
craziness at its best or worst I mean
it's really I don't know I'm getting it
I'm just open this up so I can see that
oh my gosh this computer's so slow
sometimes it just froze on me but anyway
move on
The Tick Tock Community works hard at
only one thing and that is finding new
ways to make their laziness seem trendy
it's like that game them Dumb Ways to
Die
but it's like ways to be lazy
how's that song and now they have a new
one it's called bed rotting and it's as
bad as it sounds CBS News explains
there's a new tick tock Trend that could
trigger depression in some people I'm
pretty sure they're probably not request
at a rather interesting name I know have
you heard of this bed rotting no it's
not something that sounds like something
I would want to do right but I guess
people want to do it and
that's it these are focusing the same
people like oh goodness I'm so sad
in the first and
there's no opportunity for me like your
military recording a phone providing in
bed some people can't afford to do that
it's actually the practice of lying in
bed for long periods of time sometimes
for days that sounds awful like
look that that sounds absolutely
mind-numbing
while binge watching TV or scrolling
through social media could you imagine
just sitting in bed I guess only getting
up to use the restroom
I hope and getting food
and this is a trend in these kids
I guess it's in the 20s adults don't
have jobs or something and they can
afford to do this or the kids be on just
as well you know oh yeah I wonder if
kids have bad body parties now you know
I'm so out of touch with kimchi I wonder
if if kids are just sitting around
having a bad body party you want to come
up with that okay great
you just have like you just sit there on
the couch for three days and get fed
grapes on a stick or something yeah and
eating of course now influencers tout it
as a formula oh it could be dangerous
for your health who would have thought
that sitting in your self-care okay
honestly News company stop using the
same phone from five years ago
um yeah but experts say the behavior is
oh and hello to person number four I
mean at least it was in the New York
Times
the beef I mean you might as well read
something constructive
or productive it's more typical of
someone who's depressed
once again the experts are on the scene
to point out the immensely obvious thank
God for the experts what will we ever do
without them and we can certainly trust
the experts on this one as it turns out
it is not a healthy practice to become a
voluntary invalid
School Tick Tock while eating pizza
that it
oh my gosh
it wasn't showing you on screen
well that phone I was talking about that
was the only way to do that's the only
thing I'm putting up the video like
listening at times so influencers touted
as a form
sitting in bed rotting and wasting away
their life literally uh riding and
sitting away wasting away their life
with an iPhone 6. oh no they have to
have the best of the best
the the the the the the
top phone
that has to have an iPhone 14 pro Max uh
yeah Pro Max maybe just a pro you want
to be cheap the s22 no Samsung users are
too smart to be doing this
this is an iPhone only thing but that
guy had the iPhone 14 pro Max which is
iPhone 50 comes out they better have the
iPhone 15 Pro Max too so it's a sudden
pain you know they need that extra band
in that processing power and iPhone 6
will not cut it to sit in bed you know
they might if it's they might
accidentally sit down on it and it might
snap
of self-care but experts say the
behavior is more typical of someone
who's depressed well lazy
once again the experts are on the scene
to point out the immensely obvious thank
God for the experts what will we ever do
without them
and they can certainly trust the experts
on this one as it turns out
it is not a healthy practice to become a
voluntary invalid I mean it's not even
healthy
too bad right in bed when you're sick
you'll get muscle
extra focuses or something
um and you won't even be able to move
your arms and legs and stuff so yeah I
mean I guess you don't need the only
unless we need to move is your thumbs I
guess not technically you can voice
control and everything but
I I'm pretty sure anyone who's dumb
enough to lie in bed all day and school
social media isn't smart enough to set
up voice control not try
actually it's better for a human it
turns out to to do things like wow
breaking news it's better
for a human to do things
and yes you get bad sores and muscle
after feet that's what I was trying to
say you'll also probably gain weight if
you're not like exercising and eating
junk food while scrolling on an iPhone
because as you stated here
um let me say it here loud and clear
Android users are too smart to be doing
stuff like this and I guess if everyone
used to call them poor um yeah they have
jobs in in things working
oops wrong video that's my move around
and walk and maybe get some sun my great
grandpa moves more than this all right
this is sad occasion if you're getting
less fresh air and exercise than a
prisoner in solitary confinement
that's a pretty good indication that
you're making some very poor life
choices
but then again how bad can your life
choices be if other people are doing the
same thing
very bad it's called peer pressure
well I mean that's a dumb question like
why are all your friends jumping on the
bridge did you have really dumb friends
or maybe they're running away from
something but the the message still
stands
um so it depends on right about coming
up for which but if I I guess I guess
the modern version of this question
would be because I guess because he says
I'm too lazy to go to the bridge
um if all if if all your friends
um
if all your friends wanted to ride in
bed all day for the next five days would
you do it too
that's the new question
all right again I can't accept the wrong
video
have you ever heard a national holiday
where everybody's gonna get boycotted
for it
something a bed riding is something like
you're so lazy you can't even come up
with a decent name like
that doesn't even sound appealing like
like laziness sometimes can sound
appealing like binge watching
I don't know any other time for laziness
but you know there could be something
appealing about it but this doesn't hey
hey you better go better out with me on
Friday like the thing that I learned
about last week but it's something I've
been you learned about last week where
Instagram wikiHow been doing for years
off and on so you've been lazy for years
good for you and I didn't know it had a
name for it it didn't it just got
invented
I just thought it was like just
depression and I'm sure you've been
doing this too no
um nope not me
I don't have tick tock
and like I don't but no I haven't been
lying in bed I mean I like to lie in my
bed like oh my god get in my bed and use
my phone sometimes I'm up for days on
end and eating food and it
it's a form of self-care it's a form of
self-suffication but you shouldn't do it
too often because you think because
apparently it can be apparently oh yeah
just lying in your bed
oh yeah
but basically it's where you just sit or
lay in bed
all day and eat snacks watch Max but
some of the girls
wow at least they're like high-tech and
high-end versions where they like do
skin care and some spa treatments just
from there normally in the past if I
stayed in bed all day I would feel so
guilty there's a reason for that this
this is as Brett Cooper most famous you
said go touch grass but now that I
learned that this is a thing just
because it's a thing doesn't mean you
should do it
if all your friends I'm not sure if you
have any because
they just jumped off
jumped off a bridge I wanted to hiding
Bridge or sit on Max or do Max or
whatever
um with the iPhone Max uh no
um
I am no longer gonna feel guilty for bed
riding I'm glad you don't feel guilty
anymore we all feel sad for you on your
behalf
yes uh why feel guilty for being an
unwashed sedentary bum
okay
oh dear
I just read the next thing's coming from
the chat and it's it's even worse
there's so many other unwashed sanitary
bombs after all it's a thing it's a
whole thing I mean
there are trends that were done in 2019
back when I was a wee little kid coming
up in a tick tock world back before and
it was like a Sony spy virus thing
um there was this train where people
would drop water bottles that cost 30 on
the floor and stop selling start selling
like skunks but I mean this this that
makes that dream looks like
um next-gen calculus
um compared to
um sitting in bed and becoming a bum
thing B if it's a thing
I mean I'm pretty sure the only injuries
you got from dropping 30 dollar water
bottles from then dropping 30 dollars on
a water bottle
um would be maybe like a toe entry but
sitting in bed um you would get muscle
After Effects how do you charge your
phone
anyway these are important philosophical
questions but bed rotting is somehow not
the worst or at least not the most
overtly grotesque Tick-Tock laziness
Trend to gain traction recently that's
shocking
a different but closely related trend is
called yeah they can't come off any
nutrients themselves how do you make
stuff trip I look like this video comes
on train too like I have 143 subscribers
and these people I guess get me 100
subscribers well I don't know sitting in
bed and becoming overweight
um bums depression rooms the pressing
rooms that sounds like
okay and the depression room phenomenon
involves tick tockers showing off their
cluttered filthy drug infested bedrooms
which have become unsightly garbage do
these Tick Tock is not have
a parent or something it seems because
of their depression
oh
sometimes in the video they'll clean
their room and congratulate themselves
for performing this
room cleaning streams but this is a
whole new level basic daily chore for
the first time in nine months in other
videos nine months I got this phone but
could you imagine if I never clean this
for nine months like
um they make no attempt to clean and
they said he's lazy we just give I mean
I hope these are the same people here in
America because um
they probably wouldn't have a room on
our phone
because you couldn't afford it or they
couldn't afford you a tour of the toxic
waste dump that they sleep in here's uh
one example of the genre
I've had a lot of people comment on my
room Holy Week guacamole
what how did your room get that messy
did someone just dump a load of laundry
in here
and how messy it is I'm pretty sure it
comes from the aunties who are like are
you proud of this
second of all who has that many clothes
it looks like she has two wash packets
shift the ice Shady do you have that
many clothes people in the Jack come on
you're disgusting how can you let it get
like this I'm not proud of you know how
messy I left well I'm glad you're not
proud of it not trying to make a trend
it's good for you guys I think if you
have depression or you suffer from
depression or anxiety or any kind of
mental health disorder you understand
that sometimes we just can't get up
she just can't she can't get up can't do
it
she can record Tick Tock videos and edit
them and post them and scroll the
comments to see what people are saying
about them but she can't get up and
clean her room you can't clean the room
for bed this isn't Phineas can't do it
until she does it of course but the
times that she doesn't do it it's
because she simply can this is a theme
that emerges in many of these videos
like this one
okay so I don't want to hear any slander
or any hate on well
this video because I know a lot of you
guys a lot of people in the comments are
going to deal with something like this
and I'm gonna give you a sneak peek into
my life
this is my room has never looked like
that
and I share it
so
okay this is what happens when I get
particularly stressed
throw your clothes on the floor you have
a tint
okay if you mention the person
yeah and you know cleaning your room I I
hear that cleaning can burn 120 calories
an hour so
I guess if you can clean you can get a
bag of potato chips that's right deal
here not for me I can't afford to give
all these people potato chips but they
can go out and get Fair trips themselves
or anxious or depressed I cannot clean
anything get organized I can't do it
well if that's true like shady said
um you should get up and exercise and
I guess pray
can't do it can't do it she's physically
incapable somehow in some way again this
is a this is a theme
I mean
also
if you don't let your room get messy
when you do want to bed right and
cry then you'll be able to cry in a
clean room and a clean space so that's
really helps you feel better like my
desk is pretty messy ish but I mean it's
not right
there's no clothes on here by the way
I'm fine I want to clean my room I mean
this takes the the statement
um don't put your dirty laundry on the
internet literally
like that wow I'm really really badly I
can't and I know some of you are gonna I
mean
the heck is that is that candy let me up
the resolution in
here you gotta go back like five seconds
to clean my room oh no Auto scrunchies
no oh that's a pattern okay thank
goodness really really badly I can't and
I know some of you are going to
understand that and some of you are just
gonna get up and do it just do it if you
want to I can't
oh my goodness yeah good for you you you
you can't clean your room
congratulations have a cookie go make an
NPC live stream and 50 in the comments
gonna be like lady clean your room and
dancing's gonna be more depressed
does anyone know what I mean I can't no
no one knows I guess someone knows what
you mean the last three Tick Tock is too
much I'm using account because I'm
losing brain cells yeah some of us are
going to say get up and do it because
that actually is the answer just get up
and do it stop whining yeah I mean this
is the one case in which Nike is correct
I just do it you can do it you can do it
you can shut up and do it as I said in
Adventures of Odyssey I can do it yes I
can
so that's why your room is filled to the
brand with useless junk that you bought
because you can't clean up after
yourself well I saw an Old Navy shopping
bag you somehow managed to go to Old
Navy again
technically easy may not have gone oh
maybe she could have gotten it
what's uh what's it called GrubHub but
the not the glove up food and she's like
eats the soap It's All Odds you figure
out how to walk out of your house get
into your car drive to Old Navy walk
around Old Navy buy all those clothes
with your Dad's credit card you can do
that that's good you weren't too
physically immobilized and crippled by
your depression to do that thing you
wanted to do and yet when it comes to
things yeah I have something about Tick
Tock it says I think Tick Tock
artificially increases it so it wouldn't
that be tick tock's job they want
engagement but it's probably the Chinese
government
um increasing stuff on stuff that's
going to get Americans to line back so
that if they were to ever invade half
the country be bedriding well binge
watching
some dumb documentary things you don't
want to do somehow your depression turns
into paralysis what an interesting
medical phenomenon
I'm crippled by depression when I don't
want to do things
that sounds like some logical
four-year-old to choose
is a depression crippling you or are you
just laser that's called being lazy
that's like the definition of lazy
actually it's not a very interesting
phenomenon because again you're just
lazy I mean you may be I mean it's such
a great that
let me followers and Views they get or
making money off of being lazy like
that's that's
hard work
I mean that's kind of breaking
capitalism which is interesting but I'm
pretty sure there's going to come a time
when
um they're gonna be salvation they can't
even press record so be depressed and
you may not be but one thing you
definitely are is lazy let me ask you
this
uh you say that you can't clean your
room what what if I walked up to you
with a giant bag filled with 10 million
dollars in cash and I said that I would
give it to you if you cleaned your room
10 million dollars right here I will
give it to you right now if you clean
the room
I bet you find a way to do it wouldn't
you
I don't know do you think paid the money
see this is the difference between
things like depression ADHD anxiety and
some and you know something like cancer
or diabetes
because if I offered you 10 million
dollars to not have cancer anymore you
couldn't take me up on the offer
10 million dollars just not have cancer
no matter how badly you wanted to but if
I offered you 10 million dollars this is
going to be another tick tock
I don't want to hear like some don't
feel incentivized
supposedly a chemical well okay
um
so the rest of that video is just
analysis on analysis
um so
this is obviously allegedly probably the
Chinese government okay they're using
Tick Tock to put content that is going
to make people weak and amazing okay
they have stupid bad about it which is
going to be one of the dumbest Trends I
have ever seen all heard of in my life
where you sit around and
become Dumber while watching this stupid
app
um
while lying in bed and becoming over
overweight and over uh wait
um you don't learn anything you you
don't have any physical contact with
anybody
um what other dumb Tick Tock stuff oh
yes they're also killing people you know
like I mean if these people are you know
adventurous enough to get step outside
the confines of the room and and
um uh
they didn't have people
who draw the boats moving while killing
uh more I guess able-bodied American
citizens so then the people who left
were just like sitting in in bed riding
The Tick Tock and the people who are
going on Tick Tock is ate minority but
I'm pretty super outsmart that majority
just by walking or you know speaking
proper grammatically correct English or
another language like probably
grammatically connect Italian or Spanish
or French or whatever
um
[Music]
mm-hmm and then you have to learn
Chinese if you Communists and then you
want people to afford any of the
luxuries that'll allow you to be able to
sit at home and and and in bed rod and
eat snacks and not go to work and not
have a job which is really your first
first like first of the First World
countries proper path and if you were
going to bed hot um and and wait for
inevitable demise and Invasion I hope
that you are not spending your time on
Tick Tock bed riding while complaining
that America is awful and you can't get
any opportunity here because then I will
hold up your Tick Tock and show that you
spent 30 of the last 35 days
um in a dirty messy spider infested room
well rotting in bed
so yeah and Samsung I'm also going to
call you out here stop preloading that
um Chinese virus um on your phone let's
say yeah it's not seeing that um yeah
okay whatever let's say it's nice
um it is basically infecting people
to get
mental depression muscle after fee
muscle sores to be lazy and causing
people to jump off boats and you know
what they say in China if
um all your friends are jumping off a
boat would you jump off too so that's an
anxiety saying um and Shifty ice Shady
says these people need to listen to
their Jordan Peterson broadcast
I mean a podcast is not on Tick Tock so
that means they would have to physically
swipe up on the dressed above their
brands making new iPhone which they
barely had the strength able to open up
and take off the pill Tab and everything
and swipe up go to Safari Type in Jordan
Peterson podcast clean your room oh my
goodness and have you seen the mindful
keyboard I mean I can keep which are
awful I mean I wouldn't fault them for
one of these lazy and not use them so
there's that but it's now time to make a
prom keep a promise that I made to
people yesterday I took I downloaded
this program called paint.net it's
better than paint
and I'm gonna make uh not to be like so
not to be with that website to be used
if you guys are going to get to see it
here I'm gonna show
oh
yeah there we go share screen
uh window right
hopefully you can see the pink.net shift
the ice cream at Shady can you see the
paint.net uh thing on screen I'm gonna
say hi
can you see that
maybe that's it
okay so chat CPT chat TPT says that
um
oh before we start our flag before we
start our flag we need to learn the
requirements um for Flags so this is cgp
grain
flag video We're not gonna watch this
whole thing we're just gonna watch a few
clips of it
it's about the state flags
um making so we're gonna abide by these
rankings and I also had chat gbt
integrate some uh not to be culture into
um the the site
um
last night so that we know what kind of
culture that we're trying to represent
what kind of things
that's your homework assignment as the
U.S states that you are was to make your
state flag why are they all move it but
whatever a flag to stir fry relax right
in your citizens a flag to stand proud
on the American Stage a tough task
though not too tough with the guidelines
I gave you I heard of guidelines I'm
going to try to use um we'll kind of
kind of Bend him a little bit I want to
get the word vote at by your DT maybe in
Madden maybe like a little Latin
plus
I can take that even though it's
homeschool you'll be graded one keep it
simple something a child could draw even
if they need to simplify it again good
enough two make it distinct at a
distance a flag is not a poster it's not
wallpaper it's not a patch it's not
money or anything else looked at up
close no tiny details no tiny details
we'll try to keep that
as you can see this is great okay it's a
flag it'll be flying from afar among
other flags and when the wind stops you
still need to be able to spot yours
three colors or fewer oh
that's the Ukrainian flag and I think
our flag is going to be kind of mixed
together
unless you really know what you're doing
but if you think you do you probably
don't four symbols have them your colors
and what you design with them should
mean something it should say something
about your citizen yes five uh symbol
was obviously going to be the amazing
NTB logo right there
words on the flag the ideal number is
zero it's a flag not a note that you're
passing in class thank you I'll take
that is that a sword that kind of looks
like that oops that's some Islamic
country but it's green
it's flag and understand
uh okay so uh
if you violated this rule I hope you hid
those words in a design because you will
be marked down maybe we can get that
vote thing in here
there is one thing you were absolutely
forbidden from writing because a flag is
not a name tag if you wrote your name on
your flag your flag fails as a flag
oh what an interview logo doesn't have
uh
thing in it all right
uh like
like uh we're just gonna copy out we're
not gonna at the NTB I think it's just a
little bit no exceptions all right let's
just get a quick look and see how
everybody did hold up your flags please
okay
[Music]
all right all right so Texas flag was
one of the best flags on here so we're
trying to emulate that so let's go to
chat GPT chat GPT and we we got some
um interesting to Japan things
oh someone talked about bed riding so
this must be one of the people
um live I'll read their comments
um it says at the tech boy my youngest
does do something similar to bed riding
on occasion but he also works 35 hours
on occasion
a week 35 Plus hours a week
that's typical I guess and goes to the
gym on a regular basis I don't get it
better I think either here it's
supposedly there's string trim
surrounded and the th doesn't want the
photo what's the DH directed over
playing baseball
anyway yeah um bedwetting weird
uh
yeah so that's it so before we get to
paint.net here's our chat gbt thing
here's our Christian news site flag but
first I asked it to create a legend on
the world for the word vote which is
what you get if oh it's better that here
if you that's what you want to type if
you're first calling you get a badge and
everything
and I put in Madden because Latin sounds
smart and stuff and it's probably a
bunch of homeschoolers running around
alongside all right anyway here's our
Christian news site flag and I asked if
I can Anthem but we'll go back to that
um I asked it to make it uh incorporate
the logo make it more simple and so it's
communicating and here we go so this is
what we're gonna do we've got the flag
background well I so we'll do my my uh
original design second and we'll do this
design first we'll we'll follow the chat
gpt's instructions so chat GPS says
start with the red background so I'm
gonna draw a rectangle and start with
the red background
yeah
if you can see this screen present I'm
going to share the
window
of paint.net
and it's almost a second and welcome USB
from ntp because that's such an
interview thing to do hello in in J's
um
Thrift all right there we go so that's
our paint.net thinking I'm gonna full
screen so I can't see comments for a
while
it says start with the red background
then when I draw a shape
oops that's the one thing shapes over
here I just downloaded this yesterday
there you go
it says to make a red background so
here's a fill color
uh what happened to my colleagues
that's black
um
yeah I I want colors where is it
oh no
uh
oh there's the color wheel there it is
all right um I'm gonna pick red so I'm
going on here boom red okay chair gpt's
next instruction hope you guys don't
mind not being able to see it uh
oh there's my crown
all right no new comments start gpt's
next instruction was logo integration so
we put the site's logo at the center of
the flag okay so I'm going to go into my
files
I downloaded the logo yesterday so I
have to move the background and
everything so that there's no like white
space
um
it's not gonna
if my valves just closed I mean
it crashed because it does that it's
weird like that
and my task was also going this is great
I gotta open this again hopefully you're
enjoy seeing that red background for a
while let me see
God stupid Adobe Flash Players probably
advice okay the comic I guess five tool
paint.net dimensions
uh
it wasn't last week let me check my
pictures camible
and there's nothing there so I'm going
to have to open it in a new new tab open
that logo not the
look
I'm going to images
and I'm just finding the logo from their
website hopefully they don't get mad
don't sue for copyright infringement
um here we go and I'm going to copy
paste logo into the center
oh that's big all right
um
okay
the white space kind of makes it look
nice and we also need a white striped
flag anyway it's still pretty big
okay here we go there's the logo there's
no centering option so I'm gonna say
that Center does this look scented to
you
um the next thing said the white
Christian Crush
okay so I'm gonna add the top top right
top left okay so I'm gonna add it here
so across it's just like a stick on top
of a stick so I'm going to cook the line
thing here I'm gonna pick my color
towards the center and then switches
down there never mind okay
um
yeah it's probably pretty skinny I'll
just pick a like a a white rectangle
I'll make the brush size a bit bigger
let's do to
him and the white color is not coming
through
yeah it's not strong enough I guess I
have to create a new layer okay here we
go
new layer
this twice blue maybe you'll see blue uh
it's not working
let's see let's come through here
I have no idea what's going on there I'm
gonna beat that okay there we go
now let's let's try that for what here
we go
oh that's that's gonna be okay so let's
put the cross here
and then
oops we'll drag it there
drag it over like that
copy it paste
oops control Z control Z
okay there you go
oh get me out of this
oh my gosh
go go away please
no
I just want to be left alone
please
Zoom oh my goodness zoom out
oh my goodness this program let's see if
we're supposed to church like nothing
because I'm not doing anything smart
okay
I just went to deselect I'm gonna sake
oh my goodness
I'm creating you later
maybe we'll oh stupid make the man glass
okay let's get back to the description
I'm gonna draw my shape
on a separate layer drag my wheel over
here
we go
there you go there's a there's a cross
and they have okay and I'll position it
like so does that cost like big enough
to you guys oh that was perfect right
there
we go
and then I'll move down to Layer Two
because I want this kind of like higher
up
and of course it's not selecting I gotta
pick my
rectangle select the tool which I get
some selected right back
um hopefully you can't hear that
background noise
um there's move selected pixels
I have no idea what's going on okay so
we're stuck with that uh what's the next
thing I just didn't move to the pie but
too bad now
um Chad gpc's next thing says add a
Unity simple two hands crashed potato
forming a heart an abstract symbol of
people coming together let's look up
some Unity symbols okay
oh yeah yeah
on unsplash
you know what forget the unity all right
a tagline our tagline will be foot oh oh
wait wait I want to incorporate red and
write logo integration right cross Unity
symbol tagline
um yeah so that's it I want some more
yellow in here because interview has
like this red here and the yellow there
that can be out white
and white there so I'm gonna split these
into two with the background I'm gonna
make a line
I know a rectangle yeah make a rectangle
but hopefully it's black there we go I'm
making the first girl size of three so
it matches with the original
and then I'll put it oh see that that
cross is in the way
uh I'll drag it like so
boom then I'll take my fill tool
um
where's the filter whether it's paint
bracket uh fake nice yellow and dump it
right there okay maybe I'll just draw
that thing on top oh that's gonna make
the image that that's gonna take the
image away okay uh let's just try let's
try it okay here's my shape
brush size
there you go
looks pretty good without being able to
see anything okay tool paint bracket
nothing okay
so that's our flag
well I'm pretty I used to be able to
paint over something
what's this Magic Woman do
no one does okay control and to make a
new one there we go all right this is my
idea for the flag
okay
not the B that's right it's a new site
all right here we go
um I'm going to
make my
feet
um
okay select black
that's a just a black rectangle
this could work okay so I'm going to do
red
which represents
the the the work that the developers
have done and however white stripe here
copying
pit it's Ctrl p i mean V and P not equal
oh there you go
it just kind of looks like the
Switzerland flag
oh there you go
okay whatever control V and P are kind
of weird okay there it comes it's gonna
move this up and then I'm going to make
my yellow strip
go away please for the life of
everything that's good shout out leave
me alone
okay
I'm gonna make my yellow strip I'm going
to make it equal
there you go it looks kind of flag-like
don't you think
there we go we got our image here
I'm gonna try to crop it down so that we
don't have to eliminate the background
whatever whatever good grief
can you these
a little rectangles like this
okay great now I want to move it
okay get it it oops
okay okay
here we go
I want to make sure this is as long as
the red so like it's got a match right
up
right on top
it's good enough we'll move down
and we gotta make that canvas bigger
I guess we can't do that so what are you
doing
um I'm going to
move this here zoom out let's make this
bigger
okay let's let's try something out since
lasso select
I just left
that that that's good that's good
and then we're gonna move it up we need
more space for that logo to come in okay
move selected pixels
why
okay let's create a new upgrade in the
player and then quickly to above it so
it
doesn't look good it looks like a dog
boom okay
I am not going to select
what is paint plug and it's weird okay
let's see what the comments are saying
nothing because this is looks stupid
oops
uh what are the tools they have magic
wand rectangle select
okay be very careful here
there you go
and then we'll move it
and it's just
takes
let's make this bigger okay here we go
I like this design I'm coming up with I
like this design aesthetic
okay that's as good as it's getting and
you'll do Windows key V
right no I'm making a layer of an image
there you go
so we're on a new layer now you clicked
Windows key V that's my
what is like Windows key
um because I can control it because
we'll just give you let me up the
clipboard I
think there you go I wish it was bigger
do you think maybe we can have some like
cut in space on those stripes
and then where should we put food
uh what was all Latin word for food
uh uh the Latin word for foot which well
then sounding word for food
because the land would first it's
premise or something like that um TPT is
taking a long time
and then I'll show you my answer
and only one person's watching yeah I
probably watch this either
all right let me say hi
it says there's an error generating
I think it was Primus or something like
that chat chat what do you like Primus
or book and that looks off-centric so
I'm gonna fix that
foreign
text
where's my text
it's cool I can feel that
I'm supposed to make it quick
red let's see
oh there we go
so that's white green oh that's awful
let's see where
White
pink what do it look like
lime green
not instances you give that white right
for now okay now I want to I still want
to add my text though I somehow I got on
the field tool let's see
there's a pencil pink brush oh that's
the paintbrush okay
oh it's in white that's right
Okay so
this should be bold
so I'm gonna go for a good nice
same tools switching again
there you go
uh let's make it bigger
oh
okay here we go
oh that's what it says
I accidentally keep changing the tools
for it for my keyboard shortcut I'm
keeping control F or F
goodness
all right shift that does it too no one
knows what's going on here okay
um
I want to have like Cove text or
something okay this thing that this
thing's too small anyway I'm big anyway
what what's this
it's still field that's interesting but
I I don't want that I'm Zoom fan oh it's
just regular select
uh okay
let me just yeah I don't like that image
cutting into it like that
wait maybe you're free yeah
I didn't cut that out so that you see
yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm gonna cut it out
rectangle select
all right I'm still on my YouTube never
mind
a rectangle select the background
and move and see if my opinion looks
yeah yeah there we go
so that's the selected area I'm going to
use rectangle select and cut alongside
like that
I didn't delete boom it's coming out of
the Shadows that's awful looking
foreign
yes and make it bigger
for them because the side's Great
and you know what you do when you have a
great thing
oh man oh that looks perfect right there
right there
go away stop I don't want that line
anymore
that's great I pledge allegiance to
knock the beat the greatest sight on the
internet uh what's the question do you
like this flag
that looks great that actually looks
good I'm gonna save it
save as ntp
flag to my downloads folder
okay
I'm going to upload it to I'm gonna stop
showing it I'm gonna share it and you
have to share this video file all right
um yeah so that's our NTB flag now
um let me give you the extract GP team
so we can sing the emblem you'll see the
flag officially

and then I'll share it with NTB and
they'll be happy and hopefully I'll get
a story because
gonna be one of my greatest
accomplishments
all right oops all right so I'm
uploading the file to MC converter
oh for some reason it saves it has a PDM
don't know what that is but I want to
save it as this is save it as a PNG or
something but paint.net file okay you

this this is an abomination
it is an oatmeal bite
and as we all know
as we learned that from last week
um
as we learned from last week
cereal does not go in milk
was disgusting okay but I mean if you're
gonna put it in you might as well put it
in property which means you put the
cereal in there you put the milk in
because then you won't have cereal
spicing a lot of milk duh
um
I just want to do this but as you all
know cereal does not go and milk
civilized people understand that
but there's this thing I saw at this
store called Aldi I don't know if you
heard of it called
oatmeal bites
do you subscribe to me the most
disgusting things I have ever heard of
in my life oatmeal is already nasty like
here here they are
these have got to be one of the most
disgusting vile things that has ever
been conceived within the history of men
imagine a chicken nugget but imagine you
take all the things that make a chicken
hunt good take it out in a place that
was nasty sloppy oatmeal and then you
put them in here there's a reason that
4.79 no one wants that no one in the
right mind is even going to eat this
mush imagine eating a chicken nugget but
it's mush in a bite that is what this is
oatmeal bites creamy steel cut Maple
brown sugar oatmeal what
on Earth is that could you imagine
biting down into a chicken nugget you
get filled with this this gummy goo
I know this is off topic for a Tech
podcast but this this is a PSA I mean
honestly cancel The Verge is dead cancel
breakfast best maple oatmeal balls is
alive and well today
that
that that's just embarrassing
and to my
and I say that that this this will not
oh oh the striped flag is a nice one but
it needs tassels oh okay Katie Katie
Jane I don't know that's why I'm saying
your name uh too bad um sorry uh no

what's on that okay we're gonna create a
new day
I want to create a new layer
how do you do that
yeah see that's an awful looking Flag by
the way

like I said I'm still getting used to
this does anyone know how to create
anything no new church okay
um let me put this back
come on
deselect and then there we go there we
go there we go
okay so we're gonna add like
by lying there
and then
it'll be like our main
thingy
there you go
there's some tassels for you
but there's a tattoo
really puts the patriotism in your heart
and we we're not flying that thing and
for the last two minutes we will stand
in awe
um and we're going to present
the flag as I read the terrible National
communist commitment
I want a new little TV stand that's not
that being a big enough from C to C with
a hard time plays in voices clear my
purpose to free from fear and one Spirit
one in Grace not the Beast family being
in Praise hand in hand we seek their
lives goddess
