<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 4823 Samsung Get Better!!!</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy this
week on Tech podcast
[Music]
hello everybody and welcome to the tech
boy This Week in Tech podcast
hello everybody and welcome to the tech
boy This Week in Tech podcast I have a
lot to share with you today we have FRC
competitions we have
um
uh the galaxy book 3 Ultra and our cyber
security podcast from last week went to
semi-vival and also I'm a meme which is
amazing anyway let's get back into the
tech boy right now so as you can see
here we have FRC switching to Wi-Fi
controls and I'll just give you a
summary of the auto article because I
want you to read this but also something
very exciting came from this article and
it's showing how Google bot can be used
as a study tool so let's get into it
FRC switched to Wi-Fi controls in 2009
and I delved into the history of the
type of controlling systems to use in
the 1900s in fact in the first
competition is when you see here in 1992
which is in a coin field uh they used
wired controls and then switched back to
the Motorola I think it was the onet
system in 1993. for the details or in
the article right there in the next
article we talked about the galaxy book
3 Ultra which is Samsung's newest latest
auto book which is set to compete with
the MacBook apparently
um it has the color calibration screen
screen gets to about 400 nits of
brightness as seemingly guitar and HDR
post some of the sources the sips with
Windows 11 I think regular mode and it
can support Linux as well because you
know running off the hard drive SD card
whatever
um might be dual booty and of course you
get Windows 11 WSL windows subsystem on
Linux support which will allow you to
get a terminal on device it has a 6
15.16 inch 16 to 10 aspect ratio and
already noticed there's some fans out
there with the 3-2 aspect ratio out
there I think that's like the surface
Duo's aspect ratio so I know this might
be off-bitting for someone but it has a
120 times a second screen 120 hertz
um that's um refresh adaptive so from
120 to 48 hooks just like a Samsung
Galaxy s22 plus and then you also get a
3K touch screen
a good chip
um the Intel i7 or I9 13th generation
chip which would be a three year upgrade
over what I have now on the Samsung
Galaxy
book Flex Alpha the screen is not touch
screen sorry for that correction but
there is a Touch model and they were low
slightly low specs of different GPU
um tell me if you want to write article
about that in the comments and my cyber
security tips and tricks broadcasters
lasted well over an hour thank you guys
for watching that podcast but today I
want to talk about some I think Google
broad is really really impressive you
can use as a research tool I use it as a
research tool FOC thing and let me just
show you
um it right now and three two one
all right so I just asked it a question
yesterday and it was what
what is the
um
instead of having your services online
let's go here let it uh generate a
response for me
and here we go it says FRC first added
in the tallest mode in 2003 game snack
attacks Wiki github.io autonomous mode
meaning you can correctly verify Google
barge response which is really
interesting really important really good
you know I think Google bond is a good
research tool excited sources he's using
data from Google it's updated up to date
with the internet all good and I know
that some people are afraid of AI but I
think that this tool is legitimately
good for research
now of course maybe a few inaccuracies
like uh it wasn't like uh 2019 I think
anyway back to the tech boy
um here we go back to the cyber security
tips and tricks podcast thank you to
Shifty ice Shady for coming on to the
podcast and thank you for reading these
articles but I think oh oh I forgot kios
skyos
um launched not much but I wrote an
article about kaios and Twitter changed
his logo to the Doge dog and apparently
I was able to get some information on
this from various tweets and it appears
that it's only in the web Frozen I've
put in which is why I got it on the
browser of my phone but people in the
app would think
um that is uh might be in line with the
people seeing the no soup for nulls uh
Paul here 59.7 seeing the bird 50.3
seeing the dog and I think it switched
back to the bird recently
um
and Samsung of course released a54 I run
temps oh open that in Samsung yeah I
didn't get to get into this because the
cyber security broadcast but here we go
open that into Samsung's I want Samsung
to become more Innovative as you can see
Samsung's well I guess you can't see
this but as some of you guys may know
Samsung's uh profit started dropping
around maybe S9 is 10 days right
um but now that to really crashing badly
I mean year over year it's been getting
continuously worse and what do we see
here starting from the Samsung Galaxy
Note 10 if we disregard that a series
phone a80 I think that didn't have a
headphone jack but starting from goes
back then I think it is more
experimental but it doesn't matter we
started from Samsung Galaxy's Note 10
series you remove the micro SD card from
the note 10. it's thankful he was in the
notion plus so that's fine but there's
no headphone jack there which didn't
make sense my logic back then I never
disrupted my logically it was like if
you're going to put a hole in the phone
the uh for the S Pen smart right I mean
you might as well just draw up ahead
from Jack in there as well
right
um but you're not going to put an
Essence light in there and not include
but you didn't do that
um follow-up at least Note 10 had the 3D
2 of scanner which I played drift a
little bit Duty scant on his face so
it's nice uh but then you you have the
s20 series continues to Trend right S10
series at the heart rate scanner it had
the headphone jack lasting plus 5G had
5G 6.72 honestly Samsung's first Ultra
phone just wasn't called Ultra then you
have the s20 ultra bringing 100 times
Zoom so like the K Zoom uh but you know
better
but losing the headphone jack at least
it still had a Micro SD card stock then
in for the note series the last note you
have the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 which is
we called uh a715g stylus and a bit of
processor that's basically what it was
oh embedded cameras
um 647 inch screen no micro SD card slot
on a note let's start
let's say a budget note too and then you
have the note 20 Ultra which
limited to zoom it took from the s20
Ultras 100 time zone to 50 times but I
don't know why then they switched from
the tof scanner from the S Series and
Note 10 series two delays are autofocus
game like oh that's right but that means
no 3D scanning
um there's also no heartbeat scanner
there on the on the back of the cameras
there is no headphone jack on the
Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and as the last
Samsung phone premium Samsung phone
phone that is made with a Micro SD card
slot and then you don't have the MicroSD
card slot on any of the full twos I
don't care about the flip like no it's a
fashion phone it's really skinny
whatever but not gonna it's a 1900
1799 dollars
Samsung's just continuing to remove
features then with the I think it was
the S21 or s22 they remove MST for
magnetic strike payment of the credit
card terminals which means you now have
to use dedicated NFC payment which
Samsung look here's s22 plus right okay
the only thing that's very different
than aiding it from any other random
phone on
it's like Samsung Dex which some
people's claim Motorola are ready for is
better than already
um but I don't know I've never used it
uh but like Samsung Dex is
differentiating this from
like Apple
right Nokia whatever but like if you ask
me in 2019 tell me 10 things the
difference the Samsung Galaxy S10 plus
from say let's see if it was iPhone like
iPhone 11. oh it would have been quick
okay S10 plus triple camera system
optical zoom
um you have reverse wireless charging
you have a headphone jack you have USBC
and ethernet remove the iOS the infrared
scanner that's very much but the the
iris scanner sorry
um but you still got the Dual uh dual
selfie cameras on the ads over there
um you also have the yeah headphone jack
USBC dual selfie cameras uh reverse
wireless charging that's already four
right there
um let's see um optical zoom but we're
not gonna pick that because the pickup
is pro so um that's basically comparable
um let's see Samsung Dex that's a
feature this Samsung security folder
Samsung Bixby I'm one I'm going to be
found I'm going to oh same thing because
this actually exclusive decent Samsung
features are being you know updated oh
the integrate fingerprint scanner that's
good that's good uh it did have Facebook
listen Facebook
um all right two more things two more
things
um
yeah so the fingerprint scanners of
Sonic
yeah definitely think about it oh and a
Micro SD card slot oh and the heart rate
there are 11 things that I can name now
if you ask me to name like 10 things
different about this s22 plus
um
than the iPhone 13 Pro I mean it would
be like okay there's a
there's an in-screen fingerprint scanner
just secure folder Bixby uh okay so
we've got the software features but just
no heart rate scanner no micro SD card
slot it does have USBC uh it does have
decks so it's more of a software feature
I think the app could do if they wanted
to if they if Apple switches to USBC
next year with the iPhone 15 Series
right I mean they could easily add a
desktop mode but they wouldn't but they
could and that's all for updates
Apple has their own virtual assistant
Siri they can add their own AI features
there
but they could make their own secure
folder be pretty easy to do that
and they could add a ultrasonic think of
it together
which they probably won't but there's
only one Hardware feature that Samsung
has over the either
understand Samsung does not need to be
removing features from its premium
Android devices
the a54 series I mean
foreign
Jack but
I don't understand why what Samsung is
doing here what are they gaining from
losing features of Samsung phones
like let's look at the LG V60 which
everyone's talking about because it's
got its last and 2013 updates released
2019 I think uh you can be find it for
two three hundred dollars on eBay right
now
right the LG V60 and I guarantee you LG
would have kept doing this they had it
consistent uh
LG v62 99 with dual screen case and 5G
128 gigabytes plus microSD card slot
probably a nice big screen I have no
idea why Samsung's making their phones
so narrow
sure it may be easy to hold it may be
easier to swipe and do your tick tocks
but goodness I'm going to type on this
one it's supposed to be a phablet
one of the things that is really
annoying is when people are like oh
12 and 13 minute it's a
it's big as the Samsung Galaxy new no
it's not
no it's not
Samsung Galaxy Note original note had a
different aspect ratio meaning it was
wider than the minute
also notepad bezels that's on 12 million
does not
so that's that anyway if you look at
this one if you have a Snapdragon 8
series processor which is going to be
miles better than any uh any uh exynos
or
750 or 70 right whatever seven series
process that you're getting these
mid-range Fields right you get dual
screen case support you'll be on Android
13 you get status support apparently I
mean you got like a pretty decent set of
cameras you know this is the creative
series I think that's a
you got the heart rate scanner here I
mean
I mean if you're looking to con compare
sorry compare this I mean that is an
ugly Notch but whatever if you
were to compare this to Samsung's Ultra
Series right right now
one of the best selling Ultra Series s23
Ultra
both roads have stylish support
both phones have about the same size
screen
both homes have great cameras s23 also
is obviously going to win that division
and decided to see what's better because
it's integrated but this phone is like
you could buy four of these phones from
the side of it with the dual screen case
now obviously this is not a endurance
benefit solar but I'm saying you can buy
four of these phones it's a dual screen
case
maybe get a charger in the Box I don't
know what comes in the Box here
um for the same price that you could buy
256 gigabyte
s23 Ultra no charger in the Box
probably 23 you won't even get a box
come to you like
I had a great little bag
but
I'm pretty sure the cameras here are
enough for most people dual screen case
those green case and I know Samsung's
not going to make a dual screen case for
their phones it's just not gonna happen
but
but Samsung needs to give us the option
to have super powerful phones like this
and honestly LG was still in business I
I would seriously consider switching to
LT
honestly
I would consider switching uh not
switching TLC like switching my phone to
LG but switching to being incoming an LG
fan I didn't just be an LG fan but I
think I I've become an NLT fan
this is honestly embarrassing for
Samsung and they need to get better
and they need to do it fast
well it's Apple it's going to be over
here beating me
and
so if any of you have any questions
about Google bot Samsung Galaxy book
Ultra
Wi-Fi controls and FRC
um be sure to leave them in the comments
of this video but honestly Samsung get
better do better do your job you're
supposed to be
anti-apple supposed to be
different from Apple
but honestly what you're doing here is
copying Apple throwing one UI on it
and then just having marginally better
features like a S Pen
but 100 times Zoom
Dex
on your Flex accounts
but not including features that people
want on your thousand dollar phones like
microSD card stocks when you can
literally walk down the street to
Walmart and find a phone that supports
that
that is pitiful and Samsung knows people
want it
Samsung knows what people want that's
why the a series apart from price is one
of the most
it's the best selling Samsung Series yes
everyone's not going to buy an ultra but
it shouldn't be this bad
Samsung
needs to get better
Samsung
so this is my Samsung what's this first
make your screens wider okay please
second one
your s20 is 21 it's 22 and that's 23
events we're all about the camera
getting that Nikon you're not canon
it's a phone
sound like a phone make a screens wider
add more lifestyle features that people
want keep the camera features and you'll
do better
honestly if you want a phone
hey
and second of all
your screen
isn't wkhd on your 799
s23 s23 whatever because 6.2 inch screen
is kind of small but not on the plus and
and Ultra models
even when one class can it's doing that
for 6.99
Samsung this is unacceptable
do better
God bless and Tech talk to you later bye
