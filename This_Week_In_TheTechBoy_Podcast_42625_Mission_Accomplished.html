<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 42625 Mission Accomplished</h1>
<pre>Everybody and welcome to this week in
the tech boy podcast. Mission
accomplished. SSA LTW has been
officially completed and now we can
start doing our retrospective and
started doing our analysis of the
series. So, expect to see a huge
uh point of new content coming in here
and then the web page just going to stay
online. You guys can enjoy all the
content. We're going to try to see how
we can monetize it. We have some more
things coming down the line. Maybe write
some more books for it. Maybe we'll put
some ads on the website. Let's check
that out here. But um big news big news
as I am in week one of my investigation
of the Instac girls. I have downloaded a
virtual machine application onto my
phone so that I can safely use the
Chiaom scrolly application. Um this
application is called virtual master and
we have preloaded Tik Tok on here on a
special copy of Android 11. um sometimes
with the VPN running so that nothing
gets um leaked outside because we are
committed and dedicated to investigating
this huge trend, this very very large
trend because I do believe that there is
some type of disconnect from the media
and from what social media is trying to
show us than to um than to what uh you
know the real world is and what real
life is happening outside as well. So
that's going to be our first topic of
today. We're going to be talking about
inst. So you guys may remember that uh
if you guys don't remember what Insta
Talk is, let me show it to you guys on
screen. It is this Instagram profile
where it features such amazing content
such as uh let's just pull up the most
recent video with 26 uh commentary. Yes,
great great amazing dancing uh content
here singing or what whatnot. Right. So
that is what Insta talk is there as
well. Now, there's also this other
channel on Instagram called Instat
Talks_123. That's the one that we have
delved into today. Has a little less um
following, only 200 and something
followers, Insta Talks 123. So, I'm just
going to pull this back up on the screen
today. But the reason they are more
important or more significant to this
investigation is because as you can see
on the screen, these people here uh have
their at tag signs here there. And the
reason that's important is because we
are able to then go in and pull the uh
data off of their Tik Tok profile pages
and create a list of how many followers
they have, their names, which is just in
their list here. So, without further
ado, I have compiled a uh spreadsheet
here. Hopefully, you guys can see this
on the screen. A spreadsheet of the
people that have been on here. It's
about 30 people that I've been uh
investigating. Uh you know, it's just
very simple here. So, we have their
names here. Their names are essentially
in their uh profiles. Here we got Emma,
Addy, Brookie, Peyton, Brookke, Lee,
Man. Maybe we can run this through chat
GPT and find out what the most Insta
talk name would be. And then we have
their usernames here. Then we have their
followers here. So, I did some data
crunching. I did some data analysis
here. And the average amount of
followers at least from these uh 30 or
so instant talk people that I have uh
compiled here from the Insta talks um
over the few week is about
4,400. No, sorry I read that wrong.
44,34.28 which is just insane. I thought
it was 4,000 but it's actually 44,000
here. And the reason for that is Emma
comes in here with 57,000 followers
here. 57,000 followers which and also
Peyton. Oh my gosh, almost a half a
million people following Peyton over
there. So, Payton's doing well for
herself over in the Insta Talk Sphere as
well. But, you know, with such following
as this, let me just uh do a quick
little Excel calculation
uh to add up the amount of people that
have been watching this
content. And according to Excel, the
calculations is just slightly over 1
million 1,100,857.
Um, with a combined 1 million followers,
not just counting the view count, Insta
Talk and Tik Tok people are apparently
very big and very uh popular, right? 1
million people follow follow them, which
is a it's a percentage of of America,
right? Uh that that's that's a huge
insanely amount of a percentage of
people they could like classify as a
minority. That's just, you know, 26
accounts or so that we have been uh just
pulled straight off the pages pages of
Intox, right?
And, you know, with something like this,
with following this large, with people,
you know, perioding them, creating whole
dedicated Instagram pages for them when
they actually are on TikTok, with all of
this,
uh, I I think I speak on behalf of all
of America, which is, where the heck are
they? I'm sorry. I have never seen this
in my entire life. So, I went over to
the Chiccom scrolly application uh here
in virtual master because I really
wanted to get in to in uh understand
what where these teens are coming from.
I really want to understand this because
as as you know, the tech media is now
trying to transition into uh teen first
focused media uh brand, right? after we
roasted 17 magazine for caring about the
LGBTQ blah blah blah plus teens of
America that don't exist obviously right
we are trying to become a teen focused
podcast for teens by teens teen focused
website for teens by teens right you see
this with ss ltw and we've already
reached out to some teen ccentric
creators now we're trying to reach out
to some of these people but as you can
see like they have huge like some of
these people have huge media agencies as
well so I went over to um YouTube typed
in the day in the life of a teen Right.
Yeah, we talked about one of those
videos before. I called her the second
to last hope for Jim Z or something like
that. We went over to these people and
some of these teens have hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of Oh, I got
notification from Tik Tok.
Congratulations. Anyway, hundreds and
thousands of these people
uh hundreds and thousands of
subscribers. Like if you go into YouTube
right now and you check it out, uh day
in the life of high school, you're going
to pull up channels. I saw this one girl
and I figured out why since she's
actually managed by a media agency, so I
didn't talk to her because obviously
have to pay for her to come on the
podcast and her figure didn't sit look
that interesting. Anyway, but it was
like some video of her like cleaning her
room uh like or red redesigning her room
for Christmas as this video was posted
four months ago. So maybe in December or
January or whatever and it had like
300,000 views on it and she had about
200,000 subscribers. So, you know, some
of this content is just really really
insane here. But I had to go in and you
have to look into what they're wearing
and you can see this all points to
conspiracy from Little. Well, let's look
through uh the uh the outfits and
clothing that's been worn here. I try to
do my best to classify it, right? I I'm
not a clothing expert, but um you can
overwhelmingly see that um the legging
industry is doing well. The legging
industry has made a name for itself and
it is doing a good job in here. So, you
know, I've never seen these people.
Okay, let's just open up uh Tik Tok here
on the screen here and it's some of the
most boring and ridiculous content. I
don't want you to understand how people
are spending hours and hours of their
time sitting here and we have and then
like oh the the algorithm is really good
apparently right people like oh the
algorithm knows exactly what I want when
I want it which if that was true right
for this research I set up this account
and put in the virtual machine onto the
onto the phone and um I guess maybe if I
start typing in some more names right
we'll get more of this type of content
but right now it just seems like it's a
whole bunch of slop which I mean really
doesn't make sense since I thought the
Instagram algorithm was that sorry the
Tik Tok algorithm is supposed to be
really good. Like the Snapchat algorithm
is terrible. It shows you this like fat
man woman running around the mall for
some reason. Um the Instagram algorithm
is terrible. Just shows you a whole
bunch of like mean Instagram racism
videos or whatever. And the Tik Tok
algorithm, which is supposed to be the
the uh the thing that's supposed to hook
you on there and have you scrolling on a
Tik Tok for 11 hours a day, seems
extremely boring and extremely it
doesn't seem really
algorithmicesque at all. Like when you
look at this list
here, I
mean like like I've said, where are
these people? And second of all,
like
again, what like what what are you
doing? Like if you have 1 million people
watching all following this, you should
at least see some signs of evidence, but
I've actually never seen anyone do a
TikTok dance like this in my life. I'm
not I'm not going to throw out any
exceptions. I'm not going to throw any
clarifications. I've never seen this in
my life. Has anyone on this podcast
actually seen this? like this is a huge
phenomenon. And now let's get into
another thing that I've been noticing
here as well. Now, some of these people
have been doing stuff indoors, like
taking the videos indoors, but they some
of these people still are walking around
and taking these videos outdoors. All
right? And most of these people have at
least a friend doing it with them. Like
uh here you have one on the screen.
Hopefully you guys I'm going to pull
this up. This is the second video from
Insta Talks. Okay, video number two.
Look, they're sitting out standing
outside. Sorry. are wearing kind of the
same outfits here. Um, and they have
their uh this they're standing outside
on
a I guess a track or something right
here, right? So, it's not like these
people just like cooped up inside or
doing something like that. No, they're
actually, you know, going uh standing
outside. I've actually never seen this
in any school that that I've actually
really attended to. Like I've seen like
way one person stand up and do a TikTok
dance, but they're not going to be
appearing here. They I don't think they
went viral because think about it. You
have to go viral enough for some random
200 follower account to pick you up and
then repost you on their Insta
Insta_Tox123 account as well as
reposting from some other account that
has thousands and thousands of um
followers and subscribers as well. So,
you know, I' I've been doing these
investigations and you know, I think I
want to get one of them on the channel,
at least on the show. First of all,
we're trying to appeal to more teams and
you know, obviously this appeals to a
major demographic, an untapped
demographic, well, a demographic that I
have not tapped yet because I mean,
millions and millions of people are
watching this. Millions and mill
millions of people are following and
liking and sharing this type of
content, right? If if you if you have
that, I mean, that adds on to
demographic and also want to ask them
some questions, you know? So, I'm I'm
going to send this out, you know? I'm
putting this out there. Maybe one of
them will pick it up. Maybe one of them
is watching right now. Who knows? It
could be one of the two people that are
watching this uh live stream. Um so I'm
just going to put out this message to
the the people. Maybe it'll get shared
around and they'll find it. So I'm
inviting anyone of you to come on to the
podcast to come in and talk anytime, any
place,
any anywhere right right now. And um
heck, you guys can call on to the show
right now. It's not like I have a script
that's going on uh right now. It's not I
have any interviews that need to be done
unless I can get
one. Uh
anyway, and I'm going to ask you like
first of all, where do you get your
video ideas? Where do you get your
uh your ideas for this content, the lip
syncing and the songs and the outfits?
And are you paid by Little Women? Are
you paid by them? Cuz you know, if you
are, congratulations. Uh second of all,
I I like to talk about, you know, where
you get your ideas. Are you paid by
Lululemon? Or who who do you know that
actually watches
this? Like where are you? What state are
you in? Maybe maybe it's not a Texas
thing. Maybe it's a North Dakota thing.
Maybe it's a Nevada thing. I don't know.
Uh but you know, this is a this is a
huge phenomenon that apparently I
haven't seen
that no one's seen. I'm I'm still
interested. So that's just our update on
this uh phenomenon that's going on.
We're going to keep this as a recurring
series until we get some answers. All
right. Um, so yeah, that we're going to
keep this as a recurring series until we
get some answers because Tik Tok dancing
is is, you know, I have nothing else to
do. So, we might as well investigate
that as well. So, I was talking to Rock
and I wanted to find out some local
Houston newspaper and I actually found
one. You know, you know, for some reason
when you search up local Houston
newspapers, right, all you're going to
get, especially on YouTube, is Fox 26,
KPC, year Fox, ABC local affiliate,
right? So, you know, always in the
movies and in the the the sitcoms and in
the TV shows and in the audio dramas,
you always have the kid characters and
like some local random reporter who's
always trying to uncover some big
scandal, always uncover it. Or, you
know, the kid the kid detective Emin
Jones type goes in and she goes in and
investigates
and finds some
local event that happened 25 years ago.
And it's it's big. They always go back
into the news archives. The student news
council, the student the student
newsroom is, you know, competent, you
know. So
like, but when you look at the local
media here in
in
Texas, like what what is going on
here? What? What? The local media is uh
trash. Like it's not some nice local
story. Uh it's not some nice, you know,
news news story going around here about
some No, no, no. It's just like uh
sanitized story that no one cares about.
Like, oh, someone there's a fire there
or some local bakery opened up here.
It's not like some nice little
investigatory thing like you guys know
what I'm talking about, right? You know
how the people in Advent at least or go
will go around and Emily will go in and
look into the news archives and find out
that someone new moved into town and
they actually will then find out that
they actually were criminals 40 years
ago and they go drive around the town
and do some investigations or something
like this. I'm going to show you an
example of a local Houston newspaper. I
had it
bookmarked. I'm going to try to find an
example of a local I actually emailed
them too to try to see if they could run
a story about me. So, be nice to them.
Okay. Um I'm pretty sure they're a nice
newspaper and it's actually so hard to
find. I had to use Grock to find it
here. I'm speaking about Grock. You
know, I really like Grock, but those
people who are like tagging Gro like,
"Yeah, guys, Grock is better than
Google." Grock, Grock is the next thing.
You know, Grock, I don't use Google
anymore. I just use Grock all the time.
That's just annoying. Shut up. Okay. Um,
Google is still in is the best search
engine um, in my opinion. All right. So,
I'm going to send search my sent emails
because I can't find the bookmarks
because you know the Chrome bookmark
manager is trash. Okay. Um, look there.
There's my uh yearly Google criticism.
Okay. Now, now uh no more Google
criticism from me until next year. All
right. So, we're going to go to the
website called uh my
neighborhoodnews.com and it's a actual
local website. It looks like it's mostly
for people in North Houston to
uh it's actually for people in North
Houston to uh read news about their
community. They don't live in North
Houston, but you know, whatever. And I
thought, wow, this is actually
interesting interesting concept. Some
local reporters with, you know,
localized uh with some localized
districts. As you can see on the screen,
you have
the North Houston, Katy, Tom Ball, West
Houston, don't see community. I guess
they'll let you add it here. You have
some ad here to access that interesting
little web design. Wow, guys. Look, the
web is not dead. Uh, you have this this
great
stuff. Oh,
wait. Oh, I forgot the FORC was
happening today. FORC is like one of the
gayest things ever. At least they kept
passing out those pride things. I think
I did a report on this two years ago
where I just was like, "Yeah, so FRC
just hand up pride flags everywhere they
want to go."
Anyway, look at the news reports here.
So, we got some spring ISD students did
did something. Okay, that's nice. A new
Sam's Club is coming to Tombbo.
Professionalism award, a gracious
professionalism award from some Tombbo
ISD robotics
school. And look at this news here. Does
this look like anything that someone's
going to dig back up in 30 years and be
like, "Yeah, guys." Uh, you know,
uh, we what we really really need is
uh to to go back and investigate this.
Like maybe the one thing that they can
investigate is be like is if one of
these kids is like did something wrong,
investigate a crime. Or maybe it could
be like this could be like their alibi.
Like, no, I wasn't at the Bond Burnt to
the ground. I was at Reefscape. Like,
maybe, but like come on. Always in the
news in in sitcoms and things like this,
the news is always portrayed as
interesting. Does this look remotely
interesting to you? And it's the kind of
local content that I'm interested in
because if you go to Fox 26 or KPRC,
it's just it's just boring. Okay. So,
this is as local as it's going to get
and it's just it's nothing. absolutely
nothing. I mean, really, why do we even
have the internet if we're just gonna
have stuff like this? Like, come on.
Shouldn't the media be at least a little
bit more interesting? Like, you know,
the kids are always going in there.
They're going analyzing the microfishes
and, you know, looking at old archives
and pulling up stuff and having, you
know, investigating cases because not no
one in the city of Tombball or the
Woodlands or West Texas. No one's ever
committed the crime. Come on, people.
None of you all committed crimes.
Nothing interesting. There's no scandal
in the mac and cheese at at your local
school, right? And um if you think this
just applies to uh you know, regular
newspapers, you think, well, maybe if
you want the real scoop, you have to go
into like high school news. No. Okay.
No. Okay. that remember when I talked
about a few weeks ago SNO sites which is
the number one site for
um high school newspapers because it's a
specific company built for um sharing
high school newspapers which is you know
I I should create a company like that
that's that's really smart right so this
it's the platform is designed so that
people can share high school newspaper
articles as well so I'm on the website
and since all these this is the website
it's public. All we have to do is go
find something from the city of
Houston. Let's pick a high school
because they probably have the best best
journalism. Let's go back into the great
state of
Texas. All right. And then we're going
to go into uh just go to Houston or
Houston surrounding areas.
So, Austin. Okay. Just going to scroll
around a little bit. Oh, there we go.
Houston. All right. This is from Cypress
Falls High School in Houston. All right,
Cypress. You know, Cypress is it it it's
small enough that, you know, it might be
nice. So, let's go look over into the
wingspan. All right, it's it's pulling
up. Oh, okay. This actually has a nice
little design. They have you can submit
a letter to the staff. They have some
pictures here. They have
uh little shop for opens at Snipers
Falls. But this this is interesting.
This is interesting.
Except except the um the this was this
this might have been last year for a
newspaper. This is the headline for a
newspaper. Yeah. So, a it doesn't look
like that they've updated this newspaper
since
January.
commander and and and then
they they they didn't they just they
didn't do anything since 2022, November
10th to um January of 2025.
So So yeah. All right, let's pick up
another thing. All right, let's go to
Upstream News. This one has a an award.
Oh, okay. St. John's school. Actually,
St. John's school's newspaper is
actually pretty decent. I've actually
read it before and I've actually been to
at least the stadium before. So, let's
pull up St. John's school. And then
we're going to pull upstream News from
Carnegie Vanguard. These two have awards
on them. Uh you guys can see this,
right? Yeah. So, uh St. John's has like
I don't even know what these awards
mean. One, two, three, four, five awards
on it. And upstream News from Carnegie
Vanguard has just one award, but you
know, it's better than something. So,
let's go to the review from St. John's
High School, April 25th. So, that's
good. You know, actually publishing the
news from yesterday. All right. I have
some uh news
from what
the Okay. What is this headline? Okay.
Whatever. At least I have news from this
month uh in in the school. So, that's
great. Um so, what about in the uh in
the in the archives or what about what
about you know some local event that's
happening? Some scandal that's going to
be uncovered?
I don't I don't see any scandals here.
Oo, this is interesting. You know, this
is interesting. Finally,
people. What? Okay.
Uh yeah, I I I still don't see any uh
scandals here except for Scrolling Truth
Social, but whatever. Uh but, you know,
it does look decent, but I'm not seeing
any scandals here. Let's go. Let's go
look into the uh video game thing. This
actually looks interesting. Oh, they
didn't make the game. Oh, okay. Well, I
don't care. All right. And now, let's go
over to Quiggy uh High School. I think
this is a public school. St. John's is a
private
school. Oh, they have a feature on a
student. Okay, that's interesting.
That's it. I
mean,
what? Um, I I I was alive on April 8th.
I don't remember there being snow on the
ground. Where is the school? Is it
Houston? Houston,
Texas. I'm going to change this so that
you guys can see this article, but u on
April 8th, there was not snow on the
ground.
Oh, you mean on January 21st there was
snow on the ground, but you published
it on April
8th. Prove that be like me writing an
article. [ __ ] the inauguration now. Like
why when you're a
newspaper
the but at this point you might as well
die a
documentary about the effects that snow
had on the school four months
ago. Like that is old. That is so old.
You you people the people who wrote that
act like you know oh Travel Storm Enzo
hit Oh really? This is interesting. I
don't remember there. Oh, wait. You mean
the snowstorm that we had four months
ago? Like that that's what the problem
is. No, no scandals, no nothing. And
then when people go back 50 years and go
read that article, I guess they're going
to be like, "Wow, it was snow in
April."
But just
what? So, like we went through a local
Houston newspaper, which is increasingly
hard to find, and found nothing. No
scandal, nothing. No interesting, no no
investigations. Nothing that even, you
know, some kid could do an investigation
about if they wanted to like some cold
case something. We went through the uh
some random trash high school newspaper.
Then we went to the top two ranked
according to this five and one awards
uh of some newspaper. The number one
awarded newspaper had uh news about a
snowstorm that happened four months ago
and then the review just was talking
about some Bloxburg app or something
like that.
I
just why wait why so I am firmly
convinced that the media and uh you know
like heck even even Vision Odyssey has
lied to us has lied to us. It's just
these two things they kind of link in
together. You got the Tik Tok people
here who are just
like
where okay I apparently some kind of
giant conspiracy and then you have the
news which is apparently super boring.
So, um, yeah. But you know what's not
boring? Perplexity. Perplexity is my
artificial
intelligence assistant of choice
alongside Grock. But I do like what
Perplexity is doing kind of. So, um, but
you know, I'm still a Google fan. It's
my search engine of choice. And
Perplexity has come out and defended
Google,
um, saying that it wants
to
Perplexi wants to buy Google's Chrome.
Oh my gosh. What the It's just this. All
right. So, there's some news stories
come out about Perplexity. And remember
when we were talking about how the DOJ
wants to break up Google? Stupid DOJ.
Don't do that.
Okay. Imagine using Perplexity browser.
But whatever. Perplexity actually come
out and said that it wants to have user
choice on Android, which is which is
fine. Whatever. Right. Um but they want
you know people to be able to use as a
default engine default assistant if you
have a multic of technology you can do I
set as my default assistant here but
they what they are saying is that
Google's not a monopoly just want to
have fair competition and I do believe
that Google is not a monopoly they
actually came out to Google's defense um
uh saying that they don't want Google to
be broken up which is smart that's
actually smart because they know that if
it actually ever was to dethrone Google
and that perplexity was ever to do this
then you know the DOJ or whatever
regulators are going is still going to
be coming for
them, right? So, good for Perplexity,
but once again, Perplexi just wants, you
know, it to be the default assistant
over here on Motorola or whatever. This
should not, it shouldn't be. It
shouldn't be. It should be Gemini.
Gemini sucks, but people can see that it
sucks by itself. They can download
Perplexi and they can use it. But, this
is Google's platform allowing you to use
it for free. They should have at least
have the benefit of having their own
products and services on their dang
platform. Like imagine if Apple TV was
like, "Hey guys, so yeah, I noticed an
Apple TV has the Apple logo on here, but
you know, you have to decide whether you
want Android or Android TV or Google TV
or do you want uh Apple TV on here?"
Like I know you bought the Apple TV for
an Apple TV, but no. So I am glad that
Plexi is not over here screaming, "Oh,
it's a monopoly. It's a monopoly.
Google's restricting us." When obviously
they're not. I mean, if Google was
restricting you, they they wouldn't have
to put you in their Play Store. If
Google was restricting you, they
wouldn't have to let you set as a
default assistant. If Google was
tricking, you wouldn't have to let you
use it as an app, right? And you know
how much I criticize apps and web apps
and things like this. I was looking at
some video of some Firefox phone was
like a phone that just for web apps,
which I mean honestly that's that's what
it should be now. I mean, honestly, I
don't really like web apps. I'm not a
fan of it. But like when you look at the
top apps used by people, notes, camera
stuff, that's all, you know, built into
the phone. Then you have the top apps,
Instagram, Tik Tok, Reddit. I mean, it's
it's over. I've given up. Okay. I have
more things to investigate. I have
things to investigate with Tik Tok. got
things to investigate with the news. I I
don't have the time to investigate why
people want to use PWAs and things like
of that nature. I I don't have time to
investigate why people are doing this.
Like I've I've been debating the web the
web is dead. Okay, the web is dead. We
killed
it. And you know that that that's just
how it is, right? That's all you need is
a web
app. But you know, Plexity, you know,
they still have apps. They they still
have a service. They still think that
there's innovation to be had. So, good
good on them. Good on
Perplexity. And actually, an article
that I just had randomly lying
around became very popular for some
reason. It's always it's always those
articles. I I didn't think this article
was actually going to do that well, but
it's the article. It's an article I had
to, you know, I had to write an article.
I have a commitment to write three
articles every day. I didn't want to do
another video clip. This is the Vortex
V3. It's going back. It's getting
returned back to Amazon. Why does this
phone exist? I I'm sorry. Like the
Motorola Razer is the most overrated
phone ever. Okay, the Motorola Razor in
its time was trash. Okay, it's an
overrated phone. But apparently some
people have nostalgia for the Motorola
Razor, so they they they liked it. All
right, that's
what this phone is of what the alleged
Motorola Razor was. This phone is made
out of plastic. It's super duper creaky.
It it it software is super duper buggy
and like why does this phone exist? Like
I slammed Light phone and apparently
people like me slamming Light phone.
Actually they didn't like me slamming
Light phone on one of those videos
accidentally uploaded twice. One of
those videos I had a 20% like ratio but
got brought in the views. It's one of
the most popular viewed video. I think
it's like three and four and it's
supposed to phone. So people really
liked or hated me slamming the light
phone but they liked watching the video.
So thank you all to my haters. Uh but
like the light phone actually makes more
sense than this piece of junk. So, the
Light Phone does not run full Android.
The Light phone cost $800, but at least
the Light Phone has a full keyboard.
Okay, you can send your text here. This
thing you have to send with your weird
looking T9 texting phone thing, but
whatever. It's $40. The UI is horrible.
The battery life is horrible. Why would
anyone buy this phone? Okay, everything
about it is trash, right? And it's not
they're not even going out the way to be
like, "Oh, it's a dumb phone." Right?
It's it's not a good Motorola Razor
replica because it's super creaky. It's
super It's breaks and the battery life
is terrible. So, I I guess that's kind
of replication. And the user interface
is also terrible, but not terrible like
the original model is a terrible like
it's terrible for an Android phone. And
it's $40 and you can't even use this as
your full phone. Why would you buy this?
Why would Why would anyone buy this
phone? It's a piece of junk. And once
again, I heard that Vortex was uh linked
to something with uh uh pushing
immigration or something. So,
whatever. And it's just why does this
phone exist? It really shouldn't. Like
I'm glad it exists because you can be
like have props in historical show if
you were to like scrape off the vortex
and be like, "Hey guys, that's my moon."
It's a conversation story. Be like, "Oh
yeah, I got to call my mom. Oh, wait.
The battery's about 1%. Hey, hello."
Like, I guess. And you can do stuff
like that. I mean, yeah,
whatever. This really shouldn't exist.
Like if you want an overpriced but you
know decent quality phone, look look at
the light. And you know I I will slam
the light phone. No one should buy the
light phone. The light phone is a piece
of junk. And apparently it's just
running some random launcher. Okay. The
the the light phone the light phone is
is is is borderline a scam. Okay.
But it is garbage. But I mean even the
Vortex V3 is more garbage than the white
phone which is which really say like the
light phone should not exist.
it it should
not
and the whole minimalism and dumb phone
argument is ridiculous. Right? The truth
of the matter is that if four apps
disappeared off off our phone, no one
would use them. If Instagram, Tik Tok,
Snapchat, etc. Because I saw some video
about how Snapchat from Logically
Entered was in debt or not making money,
which makes sense because how is
Snapchat making how how would Snapchat
even make money? They you send chats for
free. You take pictures for free all on
a server based thing because everyone
thinks, "Oh wow, guys, you can have your
5G connection and you have a server,
which kind of minimalizes the importance
of smartphones. Why does your phone need
this much storage and processing power
when all you're doing is literally
connecting to a web app thing here?"
Like like that girl from two weeks ago.
She was testing out this Mac which is a
$50 Chromebook and like
well Pop Tropical run. Of course it
does. It's a website. Everyone's just
being is running
websites. It just makes no sense. And
this this phone, the Vortex V3 cannot
even accomplish that simple task of
running the basic web
apps. Oh, I need to go away
and digital detox. Just like delete the
apps off your phone, okay? you you'll be
fine. You already have a phone. Like,
no. No one no one's buying this as a
first phone for their kid or whatever.
Well, I need to call my No. Okay. First
of all, this thing you put in a backpack
is going to crack in half. Uh second of
all, this thing would die in a high
school. This thing you put you you would
either lose it in your pocket. It's
either going to snap in half because
there's little like what what what is
this? You could you're probably going to
miss a call. It's going to it's actually
going to die. Like not crack in half,
but actually like die. The battery is
going to run out. Look like there's
going to be a whole community of Vortex
V3 running around here. Oh, let me get
you a portable battery. Everyone was
talking about, oh, like like when the S5
came out. Oh, well, you know, has a
removable battery. You can just you can
just put in a battery whenever you need
to. Who's charging these batteries,
people? They think it through. You have
a special nonphone battery charger.
Yeah, I I doubt that.
Okay. Just absolutely
ridiculous. All right. Now, let's talk
about SSA LTW in our final uh episode uh
officially
final thing. SAL LTW, the election, not
the book, but the election, the article,
which is the final official SSA LTW
article. That's probably where we're
going to leave it here. There might be a
few edits here because I forgot to put
in one scene. I just remembered that. Uh
but this is SS LTWD election, which is
kind of fitting because that's how the
book started. November 9th, 20 the book
the website web series started on
November 9th, 2022 when Ethan Shay runs
against uh the media and the press and
everyone to stop him from becoming
president
because reasons they thought it was
going to be like vetoing Planned
Parenthood or whatever. Like what is
wrong with you? Anyway, here we go. SA
LTW the election SA classified the
election because we have our SATW the
election book finally linked on here so
that they've come together and we're
going to be talking about the book a
little bit more on here as well. So this
article details
how is working so uh the school year's
over is working on Maverick's campaign
conducting that analysis to secure his
electoral victory and actually we're
going to get to that one because I
forgot that you haven't seen the second
to last article in Riz retry. So,
mission accomplished. We've done it. All
right. So, SNW has intercepted
information pertaining to Crush Ward 3.
That's the war that happened because of
the stock markets and the uh the the
leaked software, right? But we've uh
intercept information how how SSA uh
ninth grade essentially wanted to ninth
grade wanted to invade Gcam, but in
order to invade Gcam, they had to get
rid of SSA. so that uh according to
these leaked documents
uh they they could get at uh they the G
camp members right so essentially uh
this is what they would have said if
they were writing the national anthem
and actually cared right quote oh that's
ever when nth grade stand between the
love school's desolation bless for
victory and peace made a heaven rescue
land face the power that that have made
and preserved as a grade then invade Gam
when our cause it is just and this be
our motto and risk is our trust. So uh
SSA had um tried to prevent this um you
know like we were the NATO of the school
protected by SSA or SSA wanted to invade
TAM for the good of the school to
protect and spread democracy to prevent
Marley's terror and growing sphere of
influence to better SSA and Gam into
2024 when Geneva is a new student
council president nth grade nth grade
wanted to invade Gam to date Gam to
threaten school stability and Bon was
coined into it right via the stock
market's increasing pressure now as they
monitor v via our brand new Snapchat. Uh
no no evidence is found here. We counter
signal end of the war um with the quote
and most importantly remember to keep
Jesus the uh center of of your life um
as per operation normal. So um SSA has
essentially um come together and they uh
counter signal the end of course war
three. So, uh, SSA is always counter
signaling, always coming in here yapping
about something that no one's really
understanding until get into the
context. But then we lead into the
election. So, the problem is done. SA
does not invade the problem with the
FBI. Like
we that that would have been kind of
funny, but
anyway, this is the ATF just like
beating down the
door. Anyway, so I am over here doing
some statistical analysis. So, if you
guys are interested in um high school
student council election
uh maneuvering or consulting, just
contact me at the bottom of the page,
contact at the techboy.org. Anyway, as
you can see on the screen, um that's
that's what we're doing here. We're
looking over the maps. These are the
real maps. We just changed out the
images of the real school to this fake
church school and the 3D model school
that we have here. As you can see, it's
31 people who went, not 270, not 27 like
it was in the last election because uh I
guess more people came to school, more
immigration. Maverick say for GCA press
conference. Miles presenting key
strategies to help Maverick win. So
essentially he was down two in 9th
grade, down five in 10th grade, plus two
in 11th grade, and uh minus two in 12th
grade. And essentially the votes that he
had would be 9, six, six, and
five, which was not enough. So we we
needed to have a few more uh students
come in here as well. And essentially,
this actually kind of wraps up how SW
worked.
uh how it works. Maybe we can do just
dedicate an entire episode to how how
the series works. But you know, now with
SSA withdrawal with just Maverick in the
school, we have SA back. Jayla, the most
powerful student in the school, which is
right behind JV's now newfound Jayla
ism. Now ninth grade, no longer
influenced by World War V, which was
when Valerie N Hazel 1.0 0 across war 3
was back in SS grip means significant
immigration booster by the school's
population the new nth grade be a
formidable force comprising an estimated
25% of the student body which means he
would need to focus on these
endorsements I say um if he secures
president Allison's endorsement would
boost his support by 20% which would be
going into 12th grade and if we win the
ninth grade J might endorse him as well
especially as he has allies with Ka and
the basketball team so essentially the
plan was to target Pogius Geneva and
Hazel 2.0 O to win the sister vote
bringing in eight voters bringing in 61%
of the 12th grade vote um as this is not
a great to college uh you just win based
on an electoral high school you just win
based on the overall percentage if you
win majority percentage of each grade
you're automatically would win that's
the strategy here if you get secure dash
you get and vice versa then you need to
analyze the swing grades 10th and 11th
grade see the problem with this is as
you guys may remember back in the
original when Ethan Shay is running for
president of the Um Elijah wants to ally
with him. But you know Elijah um is not
allied
with uh the the vice presidential
running mate which would be at this time
Geneva and they would not be allied with
mostly anyone. So um he would kind of be
bringing in some more nthian basketball
players trading off some of the more
powerful kids in the school. So that
that was a trade-off that we had to look
through here as well. And then we come
up with this great idea
Right. You can't Oops. I have to fix
that to not Molly. Um, so suggesting
bringing sports to the school, which was
a common thing over at Energizer, which
was ridiculous because it would be
unconstitutional, like literally
illegal. Then he comes up, it was a
great idea. 10 pizza parties a year,
about $30 hosted during lunchtime for
the best
grade. Boom. You win every grade. You
give them free food. You get something
to look to. And you know some of those
pizza parties already provided for and
already have it right. So essentially
what what this is is you know trying to
make sure
not trying to market yourself of
bringing something that always happens
no matter what no matter who in
administration if there was no president
of school it would always happen. That's
what you have to focus on and that's
what you have to do right but if you're
running for that against someone who's
doing that of course you have to target
them on that like I I would target
people on that as well be like this
doesn't matter. Okay. Like then if if if
this didn't happen, if this event didn't
happen, it would be more of an
accomplishment than if it does happen.
Like yes, this this happens every year.
It's a tradition for the past 20 years.
Of course, of course it happened,
people. Like that's not an
accomplishment of your administration,
but whatever. But uh the Bplot is SSA is
also trying to back uh so with Maverick,
it's it's essentally easy. What you need
is JV support, all of Gcam, which is
essentially just GS at this point. uh
his home grade and some ninth graders
and that's that's that's easy, right?
That's all you need to know. That's all
you need to win. You need to win Jamie
and support D cam home ninth graders.
Boom. Landfight sweep you win. Also like
who who who is running against you? No
one. Okay. So you automatically win your
grade and
um but now we want VP Geneva to win the
election which is really really hard
here because Gcam is dead or G Gam is
over
people. First of
all went from five to two. Okay, which
with the numbers that we're playing
around with here is a lot. Okay, you
need those three voters too. So, uh,
cooked also the last remaining like you
know GK members too
uh like summer for for whatever reason
in SA polls was like dropping declining
declining declining declining okay so
like maybe at 50% when she first came in
in the story some rising maybe now like
45 40 okay 35 30 okay like if it like we
doing some stuff like this like oh well
what would happen to Vera which is like
the third party random candidate from uh
2023 rand summer right we like to play
these games right maybe we'll put these
online right I like to play these
games beater which is no okay so um the
queen of the crop Gcam numbers they're
gone okay so um yeah
cooked all right now look at how G cam
has actually been able to manage things
when they actually went to war yeah you
you might forget the the entire plot
line of this entire series was the Gcam
Javian war, right? It was centered
around Gcam and especially some JVN
members, right? And we we gave the
answers and reasons to that war in a
story on the website somewhere. So guys,
go check it out. But anyway, Jayla and
Jenna part of the G cam Javian war,
right? You know, you would think that if
you had a war for something and you tied
or won that your uh that your opponents
wouldn't be winning elections. You would
think Jayla neutron apolitical got 20
something percent of the vote in an
actual poll that we did here along with
another JV member uh who also got 27% of
the vote which means her entire agency
got about 45% of the vote over here. You
you shouldn't be winning elections like
that. And also uh Maverick hacked into
that election added at least five or six
extra votes. So you know that election
was really really close between her and
the GK member that doesn't exist in
right exist in story rights in the
series anymore. So, you know, when these
people are away, well, I mean, who else
who the students going to vote for? And
also Jenna, right? All who was censored
around 50%. Okay. 50% smack like
landslide. Okay. It was like 50 to 12 in
in one of these competitions. 50 to 12.
You know, I I would think that if you
fought a war and Yeah, you went there or
whatever. 50 to 12. Oh my gosh.
that 37 point swing in one of these
elections just for Denver wasn't the
largest
swing 50 to 12 38 uh point swing right
there for the for some for the person of
the world versus the incumbent vice
president. Yeah. Uh if if I was the vice
president I think well I'm cooked. I'm
cooked and yeah Jenna graduated whatever
but um
like cooked. And the reason this
happened is because of course Jayla did
back her and getting half school news.
But you know what if Jayla backs whoever
she wants and you know in the story
Jayla is back backed more by uh Addison
even though she's portrayed as um
neutral. Uh yeah um if Jayla back back
to Addison I'm cooked. I'm dead. It's
over. Yeah. So despite you know GM
antagonism despite postgrade recon
secured over 50% of the vote in the
overwhelming video victory without even
campaigning and Jada and her allies
going over 45% in a disputed potentially
stolen election. This influence would
obviously carry over Jayla leaning
toward Addison and some popular dipping
potentially using the very hypothetical
election Gamus nth grade supported
Addison overwhelming the new nth grade.
The 10th grader was split on her new
anti- summer. The swing 11th grade was
led by Jayla Addison and Marty likely
controlled the 12th grade which I mean
makes sense. Duh. I mean and uh say and
Addison's relatively successful
president nothing bad happened. I mean
the things that happened in the story
have nothing to do with the presidency
or without the presidency of Addison. I
mean Rock could have been in office and
the same stuff would have happened.
Okay. Like she didn't do anything to
stop it. you know, doing anything to
influence it. Well, at least outwardly
influence it. I mean, you know, Molly
just might just be doing stuff. Uh, but
like none of this none of this stuff
happens. It all centers around Ethan
Shay and what he's doing in office and
what he's doing like sparks like the JK
war would have happened no matter who
got elected. Maybe it might have ended
started
slower. No, that's one thing that we can
investigate here. That's another thing
here. So, the website's like that here.
We're going to have all these questions
here like no matter who's in office the
entire controversy the wars like uh you
know when uh Damian's running around you
know threatening summer like that has
that has nothing to do with the
president that has nothing to do with
okay so you know in terms of politically
yeah she's a in terms of socially she
didn't really do anything okay so she's
like she she's the least mo most
strained president ever okay like if she
she she didn't call in drone strikes on
anyone which would have been funny.
Okay. Um, you know, I was secretary of
state. I could just like call in drone
strikes and then, you know, hey, drone
strike that group over there, but I
guess you wouldn't sign off on it. But,
but I guess maybe can out vote of veto
him the VP. Anyway, but the point of
this is this the presidency was
successful. L. Yes, some of those things
happen because of uh the vice president
and the secretary of state and all these
things here, but if you just like say we
had a great administration and you know,
you don't really touch on events in your
campaign, you're obviously going to win
here, especially with all this kind of
backing here where you destroyed someone
uh 50 to 12. Okay, I'm sorry, but
winning 50 to 12, yeah, it's over for
you. All right. And then all you have to
do is be authentic, taking credit only
for administration success. You know,
Geneva had fun, but Addison had the
power of the incumbency, right? And it
was easy. Easy easy win. Easy win as I
say was innovative and adept at
deflecting rumors, right? I I would say
that
even like naturally adept like some of
the stories that would be detrimental to
anyone else as they was just like
whatever like like remember remember
that entire press conference thing
November 9th that entire thing that
didn't really have anything to do much
with the election. Like maybe it's way
voting. But like I still had over 100
votes.
Okay.
Uh or like close to 100. Depends on what
the student actual members were. Who who
showed up to school that day, right?
Well, remember when everyone was like,
"Oh, racist." Whatever.
Nothing. When everyone was like, "Uh,
oh, you know, the the the Watergate
spying on people."
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing stuck. Nothing
but sync. Uh nothing but sync. Okay.
It's just like oh well the fake text
message thing to trick Damian. Nothing
like it's just it's just what whatever
whatever got uh thrown at at me or
whatever would have done nothing. Now um
it would have been different if I was in
11th grade because I would have done
different stuff cuz you know to maintain
popularity to run for president again.
But like nothing. Okay. Literally
nothing. But G Cam wasn't like that.
Like you you you attack them on
something. If it's one, you attack them
on something. You know, normally when
you have three months long wars with
people, you kind of like go down, right?
If they did that, nothing would happen.
But uh J was battle warn. They need to
be battle warn as the Mavic returned to
school. Reports indicate a larger
student body than last year offering
hope that the newcomers unfamiliar with
Allison could be swayed by Geneva. A
posted endorsement from Mavic as a
election day near banking on shism and
nepotism were finally baited breath. I
waited Mavic's win and Addison's
expected landslide. expect SSH text SH
and confis at one but we were
tied that being the whole like informal
competition that I have for the Mavic
said news pulled off the impossible one
making Pocus Addison vice Pocus because
apparently no one read VP so the G came
at triumph homecoming was proof and
necess which if been run by one the work
itself can contain the books which would
be written obviously reference to the
last verse in the book of John's has
been a joy sharing the series will
remain online and perhaps some what if
style articles or new books will follow.
We also see student councils at tspire
consultations at contact oops at the
techware.org got bless and ssa lead the
way.
So that is the official ending of SSA
O2W. But now we got to talk about the
SSA LTW
book. Who are the three people watching
this? Like I'm sorry that you guys are
this bored. Like imagine anyway. SW the
election book. What if Ethan had more
time to run for president? What if he
had more student support greater
political freedom? What if STW the
election explores these drilling
possibility? This exciting political
thriller will keep you on the edge of
your seat as critical questions emerge.
But you need to beat Molly. How would
the eruption of World War I affect the
election? We intreating new characters
and uncover hidden motives. What is Very
really up to? So guys, make sure you buy
the book. It's essentially all of my
high school electoral fantasies put into
one book. So think about it. You know,
Roger School, we have uh you know,
assassination attempts. We got you know,
scooter chases. We got you know compy
people trying to spy on you, trying to
trying to defeat you. We got you know
multiple news agencies. We got high-tech
stuff. We got some computer hacking. We
have some viral debate moments in this
book. We have, you know, people are
actually focused and dedicated. Oh, also
most important, we have people coming
over to our house. I know.
Groundbreaking, earth shattering.
Amazing. So, yeah, that that is the
election the book. All of my fantasies
put into one book only for $3 about high
school elections. So, uh check it out.
And also we have one new character
Sydney who does not appear in this in
the in the thing Elijah and has been
split into two. He essentially becomes
an 11th grader so that we can have him
actually a bunch of person and actually
be like useful and then we actually have
him as a ninth grader but it's his two
personalities split into two. So kind of
how Mr. Whitaker got split into Jack and
Jason Whitaker uh when he got
uh when his actor died, the first actor.
All right. So, yeah, that that is the
this week in the Tech Boy podcast. We're
trying to focus to become a more teen
media space here. So, you know, um
that's what we're that's what we're
working here on at the company here.
Trying to produce more and more articles
for you, more and more teen
entertainment. Um I guess we can
continue LGW series, but also most
importantly, we have to find out what
are these people up to? Who are these
instacers? Who are these Tik Tok dancing
people? How do you find them on
Instagram? Because they do not
appear. I I just Where are they? Where
the heck are they? And how can Can we
find them? So, I'm hoping to get a whole
bunch of more teens on here. Just Just
like just f fiddle up in here. Lot lots
more people. This is the conversations
that teens are having that teens want to
have. Um maybe we'll launch a teen
Discord server as well. I'm working on
that. But like if you're a teen, you
want to come on the show, email me. And
also don't forget consultations
uh for STW Steam stuff, spy
consultations, electoral consultations,
