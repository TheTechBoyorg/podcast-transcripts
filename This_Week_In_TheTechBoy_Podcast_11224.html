<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 11224</h1>
<pre>and welcome to the
this hello everybody and welcome to the
this weekend the tech boy podcast
hopefully you all are having a good day
um unfortunately we have not been able
to do our B tuned to normal BC episode
yet as um the site is having some issues
so maybe that will happen next week of
course as you guys know next week is uh
the
as some of you guys know next week is
November 9th 2024 November 9th 2024
being 2022 being the day that we had you
know that great um press conference
episode but we have lots of things to
get into today why is this so laggy let
me check out YouTube make sure it's
not lagging too bad on your end because
if it's lagging bad on y'all's end going
to just make this be a regular video and
I don't want to have to do that because
then I won't be able to chat with you
guys which will not be a good thing so
let me go check
in let's see if it's
loading oh there it is there it
is yeah great it looks great on you
guys' end doesn't look good on my end
all right anyway let's get into this so
I was listening so we're going to be
talking about a lot of things things
today we have Discovery Mountain we have
um which has some new episodes out I'm
getting in into them um we have to talk
about the Breakman Adventures downg Land
Adventure Odyssey um Left Behind has a
lot of technology stuff in there so
we'll talk about that um redeemed
reformed Zumo Apple Mac and the B to
norbc so unfortunately we cannot do the
B to norbc today but but they do have
lots of tech articles that we need to
get into um also there's a special video
that I need to show on the screen that
has to do with Alexa thankfully she's
unplugged so it didn't uh it didn't
activate um yeah oh and M who's the boss
congratulations to him
for uh no my phone locked again
congratulations to M who's the boss for
being able to move out of his Studio
he's moving to London from Nottingham
out of his old studio so he was able to
do that today and MKBHD was able to
uh MKBHD was able to test out and play
with some new augmented reality glasses
also there's a new SS ltw Story and
there's this interesting new browser
based game that's kind of like SS ltw
and I hope you all can come visit the
United States of SSA all right so what
do we talk about first let's see if the
chat has anything that they want to talk
about let me check the
chat nothing yet nothing yet I know I'm
streaming a bit a bit early today but um
no let's talk about Discovery Mountain
so Discovery Mountain as you guys know
is a Christian Audio Drama um that's
online I think they're on a few radio
stations just none of them are here in
Houston area
so um they have to uh come
here over the Internet so that I can
listen to them of course um so it's kind
of like the adventures and odyssey
episodes
um they've been around for a few years
and unlike Advent it's in real time so
Co existed in the uh down in in in D
Universe um time also exists in their
universe as time progresses actually so
their town has a start date they border
Canada I believe so they have a general
location might be Montana they haven't
given the state yet but it's probably
Montana because um in this episode they
were they were
going on a fossil dig and they were not
in Wyoming I need to keep this phone
unlocked oh my gosh because all my not
drawing here and it's hard
to type and text all right yeah so they
they were they were doing that right
but the reason this happened is because
there was a mud slide at their school
and everyone's talking about flood stuff
like that and I brought up the
conversation about Noah's Art and
somehow we already have a chat hello O
Let's see what he's
saying H yeah probably all right anyway
where were we oh yes so they're talking
about Noah's Arc and Discovery mountain
is a town it's a town
that
uh that's it's like a small town like
the size of Odyssey and um apparently
there there's a city Discovery City or
something like that I don't know what
what the city is called
it's probably called Discovery City I'm
not sure but in this city they are able
to they they have a public school day
but in Discovery Mountain the town
itself they only they only um
go they only go in the town for um for
for food like but in the town itself
there's only we out thing today in the
town itself they
have only a Christian Academy which is
kind of weird because you know I just
listening to these episodes half the
kids and some of the parents do do not
believe in in Noah's Arc in fact Addison
one of the kids is trying to get them to
stop fighting about you know Noah's Arc
and creationism and uh
Evolution um not that that would
actually happen in real life nor would
that cause any wars or would it cause
any changes in an election not would it
actually yes it would as you guys can
see on the
screen come on show
something as you guys should be able to
see on the on the screen like we said um
arguing about Noah's AR shouldn't swing
an election should it oh wait it it did
here November 9th 2022 the press
conference the the evolutionist debates
and stuff like that let's see what the
comments are saying um there yeah so the
comments are
saying don't get dragged down by few and
that you're ordering food right now
that's nice all right what do we have
here oh that's guests all right
um back to the
camera so yeah unfortunately they're not
having any student council elections
based off of creationism versus
Evolution right now so that' be kind of
funny to see real life get into into a
fake into an audio drama maybe don't
make an audio drama from SS ltw that'd
be nice all right anyway so yeah but
then Addison uses geopolitics kind of
like to ask a question to try to get
them to stop arguing I haven't finished
series yet but that they haven't stopped
yet but I think it's kind of weird that
there's like this's one chrisan Academy
in town I guess it's the only school
maybe that's why the parents are sending
them there but half the kids don't know
or even believe the story of Noah and
Arc which is kind of weird because
that's a pretty simple simple Bible
story like almost everybody you know
learns it and they know it and this got
me to thinking about how it um thinks
about Ai and stuff like that and I had
three artificial intelligence generators
um
generate what Noah's Arc may have looked
like and of course we know what it looks
like I've been to the ark en counter
twice I believe so I'm going to judge
these based off of
um let's go Texans sco jit um anyway
where were we oh yes so Noah's Arc I
I've been twice I've been to the you
know the museum in Kentucky I'm going to
pull these up on the screen and I have
generated different versions of the arc
using artificial
intelligence okay and I will rank them
on which one is the most realistic based
on real life so here's Google Gemini
coming in
strong so there's Gemini and as you guys
can see at the if you kind of look down
at the bottom you can see the pictures
for AA so that's Gemini so Gemini those
look those look decent but of course
there was no outer deck of the arc and
there was only one window also if you
zoom in
here it looks like there's an elephant
tusk that's poking through the arc here
so you know that's kind of a problem you
know elephants didn't stick there task
St AR all right the next thing is um
yeah x x not do a good job here we have
a cross of um what appears to be Jesus
and disciples on a boat and all stand
here because there's people here and
there sand and I will send these to
myself so that you guys can see the full
version of them this is X's version like
what is
that how all right the next one is I'm
not sure who may oh this is Chad GPT I
think yes Chad gbt made this Chad gbt
now has image generation technology and
they did a really good job except
um elephants cannot walk on water if you
can see
that and um why is there so much light
inside of the arc like that all right
now we have to do co-pilot Microsoft
co-pilot and this this might be the best
and the worst one of all time so first
of all you have these random animals
just in the water for some reason you
have a door not where the door is
supposed to be I've seen the
door you have a door right there like
open so I guess they're going to fall
out and um there's a rainbow but there's
still a flood so yeah I guess I could
rank it Google Google actually did the
best you know for all the controversy
about Google being anti-christian Google
did the best um this one you know best
most realistic art description let's see
the comments are saying um all right
thank you um o for coming in today hello
a um I think I'm doing fine right now
not not tired um we supposed to podcast
yesterday but of course that got
postponed as we turned to Nory episode
was
not doing as well as it you know should
have been but we did get some content
out um yesterday as well all right now
back into the Audio Drama thing left
behind and I know full well that uh
redeemed and reformed Zumo you might
want to close your ears here and we'll
get we'll get to a little Feud there
speaking of uh redeemed Zuma uh has a
podcast out so guys make sure you go
check his podcast out also tell him
about tops I want every one of you to go
to the redeemed redeemed right redeemed
or reformed no not redeemed reformed
zumu has a has a podcast out theem Zoom
has some YouTube channel and we uh we
fight all the time anyway reform Zuma
has a YouTube channel out podcast and I
guys want you all to go in and you know
subscribe he has seven subscribers U go
support the channel and also I want
every one of you to comment crop top
crop top okay
um so that that that would be that that
would be great because you know we we
had the great battle of the crop top
over on X um you guys can go check that
out it's a really interesting battle
that um that went on I I think I won I
think I won because you know AA still
exist so if I lost and I guess AA who
whoever loses loses AA right um and
we'll get into that and X image
generation technology is better and
we'll probably use it you know 70% the
time instead of 30% instead of photo
leap now because it's high tech but
speaking of Hightech we got to get to
our next Audio Drama Left Behind um the
local radio station near kcb is playing
Left Behind the kids this on the radio
after spending four years playing Left
Behind the adult Edition so uh we're g
we've been hearing since 2020 it's gonna
end in
2024 Left Behind was written and I've
read some of the book I don't want the
books but I've read some of book in a
bookstore in 1995 I believe so I I
believe in the book one of them tries to
patch in to a satellite or something
using ethernet on a plane in a laptop in
a modem to communicate down the Earth
and I I I think that's really
interesting but I didn't really read
most of the books I can't talk about the
technological expertise there but in the
Left Behind kids and adults Edition
audio dramas I find it interesting that
they use you know in these DRS probably
came out in like 2006 that kind of
analog esque Tech you don't really hear
about smartphones being you know used
you don't really hear about like you can
hear the flip of of a flip phone and
stuff like that maybe they have a
Blackberry um you you hear the people
using aning machines and like landlines
and stuff like that but later in the
series you know when the when the
Tribulation Force is you know getting
together and they need to communicate to
the field offices
around America and the rest of the
world they have special satellite
communicable
laptops which I find weird a their
technology is extremely expensive you
know it's also pretty high-tech compared
to what they have like Left Behind is
kind of like a Hightech Sci-Fi
series that is still using technological
conventions in
2006 I just find out to be really
interesting but when we talk about the
technology like we're talking about
satellites GPS all this planes still
stuff like
this it really shouldn't work in the
United States if like half 70% of United
United States claims to be Christian to
say that half of them actually
is half the people are gone that's half
the military that's have you know
satellite operators GPS the electricity
internet should be down I mean you guys
should be working off of I don't know
1840s Tech at least I mean it takes I
guess the satellites themselves might
work but you know people who work them
need the technology to get them to go
through so Left Behind technology
technology is kind of it's kind of
weird what is also weird is Brinkman
Adventures Brinkman adventures also
exist kind of pseudo in the real world
they have three real world adventures
and then three nonre World Adventures
like because you know the Brinkman
family they actually exist and they play
themselves incept for the mom and dad um
well in one of the nine Real World
Adventures they went on some type of a
trip like a race across time to go visit
historical historical sites also again
they went and actually visited the
actual Arc and Creation Museum that
exists you can actually go to it I've
been twice um in in
Kentucky they've been and they're racing
across time in minivans and they you
know then there's some evil Po that's
trying to get Christians to fight on TV
or something like that but I what I also
found interesting about this is other
than the the fact that you know they're
going to real places that exist and
they're not real in a sense because this
race obviously didn't happen to be video
of it is that they actually addressed
artificial intelligence chat boot in it
where someone was talking about how they
had like doubts or
something put on by an AR chat but now
Jonathan Park and I've never listened to
it but I've heard about how it has these
people they had a Brinkman Adventures
crossover actually Jonathan podcast
these people like these evil professors
that want to destroy creationism or
something like that um
so maybe the chat B is a continuation of
that maybe it's evil technology of
course you know our Alexa system has
been broken it's been it's been down for
a little bit so
it I I I have not really been able to
listen to the Keys for Kids broadcast at
2 o'clock when they play the Breakman
adventures and of course I don't pay for
the subscription or drama fire or
anything like that speaking oh wow we
got we got mail there nothing important
all right we uh speaking of uh Alexa The
Babylon B put out a an article and I
decided to fact check it so in this
article they said that um when you ask
it questions Alexa when you ask Alexa
questions you get
uh you
get you get really long winded and so of
course I have an Alexa I wanted to test
it out I wanted to see if the long wind
did answers existed so um I decided to I
I decided to test it out and here's a
video of it happening let's see if the
let's see if the fact check is true or
false okay we're the best fact Checkers
in in the universe all right so here's
the video this is a real Alexa taking on
my phone no edits no Luma Fusion just
full full video
Alexa what's the traffic like today who
doesn't love a big yellow school bus
Alexa set a 3 Minute
Timer it is time for us to do what we
have been doing in that time every day
can you tell me a fun fact about the
Roman
Empire I didn't just fall out of a
coconut tree yesterday we exist in the
context of what came before us Alexa
what time is it the significance of the
passage of time right the significant of
the passage of time when you think about
it there is is a great significance to
the passage of time well uh that's a
fact check right there fact check true
it actually happened it actually existed
so um oh we have
chat hello David um thanks uh thanks for
coming in here um so yeah fact check it
actually happened so you
know Alexa got the uh Alexa got the
virus
so yeah that that's Alexa um for you
right there
now speaking of Alexa and artificial
intelligence and stuff like that grock
ai grock ai has first of all been able
to do some prompts
that of the artificial intelligence uh
programs do not like and grock
AI is astounding so here we have a
picture of Ava Haru um of course grock
AI cannot choose from faces yet but it
it can um describe images and it did
describe images well it and it's only
$50 I think it's might be the best
artificial intelligence image gen
technology of all
time because it it's doing such a great
job let's see what David says what's
wrong with Alexa oh so yeah the Babylon
B you know they released the thing
saying that it would give long winded
article answers and stuff like that so I
decided to test it and and it did it did
it did it no edits at all nothing anyway
um wait oh yes the artificial
intelligence is so good and you might be
like well she she looks like she looks
normal right whatever but first of all
it's able to describe images from
Instagram of like what what we say that
there advantag is that of course they
know they know what they're doing right
of course I've never had to interact
with stuff like this before because you
know I've never owned clothes like this
before so you know they have that
Advantage also have the advantage of you
know being the cap
to move physical physical bodies and
stuff like that so it doesn't work but
you might say this image doesn't look
like anything special until you zoom in
right and despite the fact this is from
a described image does a great job it's
also very realistic I mean when you look
at the hair the hair looks realistic and
stuff like that when you zoom in what do
you see here this is a uh iPhone 16s
phone right you can see the amount of
fingers one two 3 four and then the
thumb that's holding it it is is really
detailed and realistic it actually looks
like a phone now when we go into photo
leap in photo leap actually would cost
more money over it it actually no it
costs less money but New Generation
technology isn't as good when we go into
photo leap and photo leap it does do
good backgrounds it does do it gives a
more aesthetic feel to it I guess they
look
more I guess the coloring that it uses
is better and also you know you can
import faces into it so of course face
tuners are going to be I'm sorry photo
leap isn't going to be totally
eradicated from what we have here but if
I just type in say a woman
taking and of course with uh gr you have
to be specific in what
you you you what you um what you say
because it for some reason likes to just
do like top and of course for reals you
need it likes to do more squares content
as for as photo Le likes to do more
vertical content of course vertical is
important for real so you have to be a
bit more descriptive with
gr so as photo leap is generating our
comparison image right notice how real
the phone looks and stuff like this and
of course because GAC is constantly
updating stuff like this I think and we
can try it right now I think
that I I think that grock would be able
to
um generate real phone models as they're
coming out so s24 Ultra iPhone 16 Pro if
I wanted the third camera right it says
it looks real to me yeah and of course T
you know generated it's not real now
photo Le finished generating the mirror
selfie images and here's Mirror Image
mirror selfie image one so we have one
phone that kind of looks like a
iPhone 10 I guess I mean look
how splotchy
it is and the
fingers then also that doesn't even look
like a real phone and she's holding
another phone in her hand that looks
like a cross between a Blackberry P
passport and a car accident um that not
good
to
also sometimes it gets the coloring off
sometimes it gets it bad if it gets it
bad of course I have to go in and edit
it myself oh this one actually looks
pretty good um comparative I mean this
kind of reminds me of some offbrand
maybe like a new phone
or or or something like this but it it
does too much right so you see this
phone here kind of remind you like some
wish.com ask uh iPhone 11 maybe 11 Pro
but when you look into to the mirror
look at her face right she's supposed to
be 20 right but I didn't tell her that
but from the look she's supposed to be
20 right also it's from the imported
image in the uh in in the reflection it
looks like a totally different person
can you see that yeah right there on
this side the camera is flipped and
she's also holding a black phone in this
hand of course with the WR and
everything off and it kind of looks like
a terrible phone also that would make
this phone like 4 inches which phones
are not 4 inches like that anymore and
then to the next
one I I don't even know what to say like
you have a iPhone XS Maxes
phone and an iPhone 6s in the same image
you can see there 6s in the
let me move my volume icon you can see
the 6s in the mid a little bit and you
can see the 10s in the in the hand
doesn't look good at
all also GAC has been able to do more of
what we see in line with Instagram it
rarely declines you know request for
photo leaps moderation
is uh different it is different so I I
do think that we we will be seeing more
of grock coming in of course we just
have to be a bit more specific um so we
can get our vertical images as well as
our horizontal squarish images as well
also I found out that the account's on
some type of a hold so it's kind of like
stuck at followers so hopefully we can
get that resolved so we can break
through the 300 barrier and Eclipse um
some real people L know like let's
Eclipse Geneva uh Geneva of course being
from SS ltw right who the real person of
Geneva and let's
um let's eclipse
uh oh well she hasn't been introduced
into the series yet she'll be introduced
into January so I think that's a nice um
lead off into um ssw ssw we've been
importing our stories back into uh we've
been importing our stories back
into stuff notebook lolm is doing a good
job and we have our latest episode here
hope you guys can see this on the screen
gcams
Gambit uh no you cannot see this on on
the screen yet let me let me let me stop
screen sharing and then start screen
sharing again so yes this this latest
installment of this is called gcams
Gambit G Cam's Gambit is I do not like
that there you go gcams Gambit so this
um follows I think we gave a a press
about the developing situation in the
middle school I don't think we got to
that one here but G Cam's Gambit follows
into um SSA is going to be filming a
news episode but unfortunately the Rel
the usually reliable crew crew of gcam
that needs to be um for the episode
cannot make it of course they need to be
here for the for the episode so that we
can show strength against Molly and Val
Molly and Val who of course threatening
um Sienna's person also Denver is in
this episode too and also we're working
together on project uh on a project the
Eon Shay for GCA
uh the presidential transition uh
project um transition from Allison to
Eon now that's what the Xander means so
if you see this that's what that
means
um and we need to do a show against you
know Senator via VP hopeful Marley and
our agents in jvn also need to keep them
at Bay as well
um keep jvn at Bay keep the you know war
from spiral spiraling out of control
from gcam
right and of course you know some stuff
happens and here I will say that Hazel
is in this episode Hazel does a lot does
a lot of spinning in a chair um we also
talk about beeper Min beeper Min of
course you guys know that application
and we have our first ever SSA the
classified crossover into the real world
so as you guys
know the tech booy media has done lots
of crossovers into SS ltw like we're
doing a crossover now like this is a
real podcast and we're talking about the
fictional Universe of SSA ltw but SS ltw
has never really transitioned over into
um into the real world until now um like
we haven't really beened any podcast
episodes we
didn't like going to but outside of the
chapter of SSA lcw of course we use
codeen names like you know CM for NTB
and stuff like that
so it transition into the real world
like an actual linkable transition into
until now where we mentioned National
Security Agent J this is a true actual
fact like 99% of the stuff that happened
to is fact um I didn't realize that we
spun around so the new story was
supposed to come first and then Sienna
was supposed to uh have that thing R Val
but it makes more sense to have the new
story first also another thing like that
you know the locker mystery um the his
bag them's bag is stolen and then he
gets smacked in the face with the Sho
and then it gets swapped around like
that again so there are bit there are a
few swap arounds for the timeline of the
thing but but most of the events the
events end up themselves did happen
except for like the press conferences
that's just in my head um and then of
course like that those are actual things
that happened in my head back then but
then of course you know the lines are
coming down but he was an actual thing
that happened he did have an US 22 plus
at the time I also did have an that 22
plus at the time so I guess you can
count that as a crossover if you want
but here's the thing Team 13 uh as you
guys know in 2022 we the tech one media
announced Team 13 which is basically any
teenager that has once an Android phone
being the 133% um December 13th 2022
yeah being the 133% of teens that uh
have Android phones here in the United
States of America all right presidential
solidarity party sucks by the way right
so yeah unfortunately we cannot change
the Adge on our site for the 10 cents
that they pay us all
right anyway yeah Team 13 so it's our
first crossover so now that's ltw has
fully crossed over into um the
united into the United States of uh SSA
which leads us to our next topic being
politics and War the United States of
SSA is the name of my nation currently I
am at war right now I'm I'm at War this
is a really interesting browser based
game you have alliances and people
continue money currently I'm in the
Camelot Camelot Alliance um hope you
guys can see this on the screen here
here we are oh I don't want want you to
see that yeah I don't want my rivals to
know how much money and stuff we have
here but yeah the United States of SSA
and this is I guess it kind of
transitions from the game into into real
life has to say OTW life because the
president's name is Ethan Shay and you
can declare Wars on people and stuff
like that and and get money and you can
get into your alliance I'm in camot
Alliance and you do so much they have
like Discord servers and stuff like that
you can see how much money you have and
they actually have Banks where you can
transfer money the wars
the I chose the uh I chose my cities
here so the capital city being SS ltw
then we have Greenville uh I guess it's
named after North Carolina and the video
game then we have Glory which is named
after the school and ltw Pentagon which
is a military base 1,000 which is named
after the amount of infrastructure and
land it has FL socks obviously bum Ville
I defeated City and its name is budville
so I thought let's call it bu that M Mo
came up for that name um War
self-experiment old I just got barded
and Bob also I got barded here and
unfortunately I do not pay for the game
um it's really interesting have to do
some strategy you have to you know build
up your military get up your Air Force
I'm at some really you know close Wars
as well 100% approval rating wow
10076 how do you get it approved more
times than once I don't know but I have
a pollution index I don't really know
what that means radiation index of
course affects food because you can nuke
people in this game which is really nice
but um of course we have a Christian
Nation I haven't made my flag yet I I I
just playing around with some of the AI
to make my flag and I actually had a
nice happy accident where we created
this great like grock is really good
really good um we created this great
flag I did some post- production editing
here but I mean look at this thing
wouldn't this look good great as a
wallpaper amazing amazing anyway back to
SS ltw oh yeah so maybe I'll make that
my flag I might make that the flag of
the nation if that that is a amazing
image here but you know you can buy some
soldiers tanks aircraft ships spies you
have to buy missile Launchpad and oh
yeah I got struck by missile today yeah
I'll be fine uh and nukes of course um
my military spending 133% trying to get
that up for city is it cost lots of
money so that's why it will always cost
that much money um I mean Camelot you
get money you get like subsidized until
so yeah you get money I had some money
sent to me I was about to lose I was I I
was blockaded within my Naval team
defeated broke through the blockade and
using some money from the alliance we
broke through and unfortunately you
cannot um launch national anthem here
unless you pay but if you could you guys
know what the national Anon would be of
course would be the SSA lcw song SSA was
proven right Wiz can be what has been
used to fight all right speaking of what
can be and what has been and stuff like
that
um I'm getting like ads for
whatever what can be what has been stuff
like that
um CI B who's apparently famous or
something I don't know maybe she's a
singer um here I I had to revoke her
membership from the Samsung fan club
here you guys can see this on the screen
I'm not going to read it out for you out
loud but you guys can read it yourself
and I actually had a nice conversation
with one of uh people that I had an
argument with kind of like he's kind of
like redeemed Zuma light um he follows
me I follow him back so yeah as leader
of Samsung fan club I had to roke her
membership um as you guys can see on the
screen it looks like she's using a uh I
don't know maybe that's an a54 but she's
like famous look at the SC like the
edges of the phone and stuff like that
maybe you have like three maybe that's
an Ultra phone too honestly sad like and
I went into this like how are you
supposed to how Samsung quote how is
Samsung supposed to make chips like I
say I'm going to read it
self-contradictory
pixels in here and um Google Google you
know being big bad Google spying on
people again
which uh more power to Google I guess
again and speaking of Google got hit
with the fine from Russia's very very
corrupt government and of course have
people out here whining like goodness
goodness uh hopefully they both take
losses because you know Google bad
Google bad also I'd like to point out
that
um you wouldn't have a job without
Google okay no one would know how to
find your website without Google
so H yeah and also before you try to say
Google's a monopoly or something like
that and they took down some Russian
propaganda channels on YouTube right or
something and uh yeah so they got a what
was the number
again two
unilan uh dollars which is 98%
which um Google is a trillion dollar
company and that's only 2% of their
budget so that they don't be able to put
it put it off they sold off the entire
company right so of course are like look
go if you want to pay it off and go
bankrupt in the process you're not going
to
complain sure sure fine no Google we all
be stuck using
Bing that that will oh you can't even
see the screen it's probably a good
thing
because uh yeah yeah but let me show you
let me show you on the screen yeah they
been hit with a fine you're like oh
goodness Google was struck by a fine
maybe may may maybe it will be uh better
better if they did no no it wouldn't
okay you guys know that we know that
Google is good and also I don't want to
have to use Bing I don't want to have to
use uh
Edge like Edge is good for one thing and
one thing only downloading
Chrome all right speaking of download
Chrome a new Mac came out this week but
I have an article about MacBooks but not
about the MacBook that just came out
MacBooks are basically big iPhones I
claimed of course this is so last month
that maybe maybe it's wrong no for teens
and adults MacBooks are basically big
iPhones and before you come at me and
start yelling at me and stuff like that
and let me see if I can share the screen
a few
guys all right there we go I'm figing
out this
software okay let's get rid of that ad
but okay um for teens and most adults
and when when you look here this is a
stock picture I don't own a Macbook you
can see that mostly these applications
except for iTunes which no one uses and
um the stock applications that come
preloaded onto the
device like settings that doesn't count
are mostly web based applications are
very
light applications like word excel and
acrobat but the rest of that you have
Spotify you have your browsers and then
the rest of it is fill of stock
applications these the applications you
use the most when we get into this and
of course I know I'm stting obscure
random movies
again why I saw this movie The Click
because I was researching how clicks
operate under the absum that movies
emulate real life they do not of course
this was
gcam but no it didn't look like that of
course but anyway in the movie you seen
them using Macs and you know iPhones I
think like one iPhone exists in the
entire movie because it's a 2008 movie
so the iPhone came out you know as it
was you know getting filmed and stuff
like that maybe right before it got
filmed because it came out late late
2008 like November or December I didn't
watch it in 2008 I just looked it up um
yeah when we see the kids in the movie
they're using an instant messaging
application a video chat application so
they're using like pre- FaceTime stuff
that I think Max had and some text
editing yeah they had a picture I wanted
to take a screenshot but YouTube
wouldn't let me because it was like a
YouTube movie or something where she was
writing like the State of the Union
which is is which is good right so
actually she she's a bit more she's a
bit more advanced than uh most people
because most people don't write State
unions and like I go into this like I
say most people don't you know runp
agencies and not at risk of being hacked
or anything you know but yeah that's a
two Night movie right so people are
different right no when ier people you
know running
Max mainly kid and stuff they're running
course key key websites like I say in
the uh in the sslw series The Swing
grades the very most important key
grades in the
school I guess these should be the swing
websites the key was
important websites for or Instagram and
Tik Tok they use Safari they don't even
use Chrome which is kind of sad some of
them use Chrome but you know some of
them are stuck using Safari which is sad
maybe they use some browser based
applications like canva which is kind of
sad because canva I really wish we had
an offline ver canva with the stock
images and videos and stuff like that I
am a way graphic design does exist and
of course you have some light gaming on
2007 esque website it's kind of like uh
this game there what's it called Club
Penguin chat I think BR had a video
about that I don't know what it's called
Webkins is that still
around um then maybe if the if you if
you're really Advanced you might use
some Roblox and I I really find this to
be really depressing and quite sad I
mean think about it you have a Macbook
some of these some of them even have
Pros which I don't really get because it
doesn't make sense but know most of them
have
A's and their phones I guess they have
an Android phone be more powerful than
it especially if it's an older R and
Macs do run some iPhone applications and
while the average team might not use do
that yet they have a keyy few
applications that have blown up iPhone
Bo like we see here we have slack which
I don't really get slack as an
application or Discord or anything like
that you can install browser
notifications if you want
to um you can run iPhone applications
like this thing would be useless without
the internet I mean sure you could type
but you can type on any computer big
whoop um so you access the key Tik Tok
stuff like that Roblox and of course
some streaming use Disney plus Netflix
or some random illegal website that you
shouldn't be
on and committing CRI
s of course you know Max have IM message
and FaceTime enabled on them so you know
they do the chatting like just like they
did in the movie of course it's the same
stuff that they did in the movie except
of like
watching YouTube existence so got
YouTube on on a Mac and the Mac some
phone to of course the kids w't using
laptops they
using Mac MacBooks
itself um and there's some text editing
done as well of course all the stuff I'm
naming can be and has been done on the
phone I mean I wrote this entire article
on a phone I uh I ran my blog off a
phone for a week so you guys can check
that out wait how did this comment get
through I'm G have to delete Edward's
comment anyway
um yeah so it's just kind of like
information chatting stuff like that it
must been even done in Google Docs like
this person here they are using word so
I know it's not entirely representative
most people type in Google Docs so their
laptops entirely useless without an
internet connection which is which is
wild seeing as Max existed since the 80s
when you know the average person didn't
have access to the internet as well so I
mean Mac basically huge smartphones and
now with the uh
special screen share things they have
now people just running their phones
which are not used as they should be
used and I I think about that every day
and they're just going to run the key
apps Tik Tok Instagram and Snapchat off
a phone from like 30 feet away and then
not even going to use like their Max
features it's going to be like oh guys I
have a $1,000 keyboard for my Mac uh for
my for my iPhone isn't that nice
anyway speaking of minimalism and stuff
like that I guess it would be maximalism
but minimalism a company tried
to oh that's a truck not my earbuds all
right a company I saw this a few weeks
ago is aiming to turn your Apple watch
into a smartphone because you know you
want to be less addicted to your
smartphone or something of course you
know the problem with that is in order
to use an Apple Watch you need to have a
smartphone so this is basically a
case for uh people who jobber co-pilot
was designed to help home service pros
confidently overcome any business
Challenge and sees every all right here
we go Dave 2D a few months ago this
product was announced out of nowhere
mean look at this thing it kind of looks
like an iPod in my opinion that's what
they're aiming for they have a thing
here in the screen I thought maybe
they're selling them with the screen
enabl nope you have to have a Apple
watch and if you don't have one they
suggest you buy like an older one that
has LTE so you can use it for phone
calls I can imagine people trying to
sneak this sneak this in maybe to text
people come
on but I mean you think about you can
you can get a phone that small you can
get un Hood spocket jelly can get the
Palm
Phone tiny pod and it's a gadget that
transforms your Apple watch into this
iPod looking thing but it also has a
scroll wheel and the marketing around
this thing is very interesting it kind
of hits on the whole Nostalgia and like
Nostalgia is a billion dollar business
Simplicity of a device like this but
because the core of this product is an
Apple Watch it has a lot of modern kind
of
smart of course you know you can't
really do much on it like you know doc
editing um there's no camera
unfortunately even though there is a
strap for your camera so I mean if you
wanted a camera maybe I don't think this
is there a gallery application for this
though let me check but let's just get
through this he basically says that the
scrolling isn't as good as it can
be um and it it needs to do you know a
lot better is what what what he says in
his opinion but they do only retail for
about uh $30 though that one didn't
wouldn't have a squir wheel which would
Bas make a case which fun fact you know
those kitty zoom VTEC watches I was
thinking I one time I took like the
wrist the wrist wrap off and played with
it uh just by itself like as a miniature
tablet of course the screen the body
ratio was actually better than Vex
actual tablets the VTech kitty zoom
tablets and stuff like that because the
the bezels on that thing is is huge huge
all right speaking of huge good to m is
the boss is a really big Channel over on
YouTube he um talked about the most rare
he found the most rare and obscure
phones and
um let's talk about
it all right hope you guys can see this
on the
screen wait it's not letting me show
showing is
caring oh okay there we go share the
[Music]
screen remember that time we reviewed
every uh all the good VBS theme songs
this VBS theme song was awful awful I
mean it was a crime against VBS theme
songs let's see shift
two okay I want to see I don't want half
screen there we go that's good
I'm a reaction channnel now oh right
that's better because I don't want
YouTube to flag me but let's get into
this most beautiful phones on the
internet unfortunately of course we
can't scan them in because they're not
people but whatever some of the most
glamorous Limited Edition phones on the
internet I'm talking Disney Princesses
to high-end fashion designer
collaborations with the top few having
their own surprising extra twists so
settle into your most dripped Out Chair
this one's going to be oh yes I was
reading about this one total waste like
imagine and once you see the price you
you'll see why I'm saying this but
imagine buying a flip phone I think it's
runs on Kos might even run on hmd is
even worse operting system and even Kos
doesn't even support WAP anymore so this
thing is useless but it's pink pink
Power very sparkly starting with the
Barbie phone by
$130 you can buy two smartphones for
$130 hmd the company that's now behind
Nokia phones real phone without
distractions when they try to sell no
distractions they try to say overpriced
also no distractions no distractions the
time that you would have spent SP
sending on Tik Tok which is what this is
for this is for people who have iPhones
who want to be I got a Barbie phone guys
I'm a barie
girl you guys know what the what it's
going to be replaced with and first time
you guys know know what you going to be
replaced with uh
uh it's going to be repl place for
people running up to you and like what
is that what is
that ironic for a hot pink device with a
mirror on it whoa so when this when he
uh opened this here because like on X I
guess I'm really really popular with
like
Catholics I I thought maybe the beads
was like a rosary or something because
like they always those always pop up on
my feed also this has been popping up as
well the loose thingy like see how she's
wearing the
necklace uh yeah also loose loose is
amazing I was like wow this is this is
great and of course I released an
article saying uh hope you guys can see
this on the
screen
uh yes I released an article saying
headline says it all in response to
Catholics lose Protestants released 572
versions of the same doll being one for
each denomination and I guess one for
each non- denomination here but um
anyway so yeah I'm very popular amongst
them and I'm very glad and thank you for
it uh oh I lost
my I lost my uh video feed hopefully you
saw loose loose is great we we we we
really need to make a version of loose
for uh non-denominational all right back
to the phone I don't even know where to
start there's a friendship bracelet
looking thing that I think is actually a
yeah that's not what I thought it was
but you know that's uh I actually ran a
poll like I think 50% of them are
so doing pretty well amongst them and
also you know I guess redeemed and
reformed zumu have um all collaborated
to come in battle me at the battle the
crop top which they will both lose well
have
lost the dazzled lanyard for the phone
you got second back plate oh no there's
two spare back plates and then the phone
is in the middle you know what's also
really cool and probably a sign that I
am a married man now this is presented
just like a jewelry box right down to
the dividers and the soft felt interior
someone's had a very good time putting
this together oh my God it continues
there's a Barbie branded screen cleaning
cloth so these are incredibly fiddly one
second these are additional pendants
that you can add to further it I don't
know why it had to be a flip phone
though like it's parue eyes feel a bit
like pencil razors is this a battery oh
my God they made the battery pink and
then a sticker page and even glitzier
sticker page and of course the
instruction manual is in pink too what a
treat is pink
expensive I have to show this Google
update that I just oh so this is
actually a what did we just
see uh oh
no I'm going the fast forward in front
of you right now are some of the most
glamorous limited phone all right let's
go I think
is all right let's go come
on I wish they made the phone a tach
scen at least all right so the actual
software is kind of basic although I
will say yeah think satisfying to use
everything looks very themed and each
action has its own accompanying sound
effect what's this Malibu snake there's
bie version of snake wow also it looks
like there's nothing it really does like
it just has some of the basic phone
applications which you think about this
like most flip phones maybe not this one
most flip phones can connect to the
internet and most of my applications
like we've said multiple times the top
50 applications were just portals to the
Internet so yeah you could probably use
a flip phone but no we don't want to
also you know this is supposed to be the
beun the norbc episode I supposed to
talk about social media and stuff like
that um according to the THM News
application Florida Florida attempted to
ban social media and um they got smacked
um with like lawsuits and stuff like
that which totally makes sense like you
can't just well ban social media have
some like type of license and I saw some
antisocial media article saying like oh
Meta Meta should have kids upload their
school IDs to make sure that they're 13
on Instagram that's stupid also trying
to ban kid off of social media is stupid
um also especially creating laws against
that in in Florida oh well guys guess
what you just did a great you did a
great service to all the VPN channels
out there n is GNA be bringing in the
money I think I'm an affiliate kind of
I've never used the links used them like
once um Nord n is going to be bringing
in the money like what you're just G to
ban all the kids off of off of social
social media in
Florida Florida you guys know what
people do on social media they take
pictures you guys know what people do in
Florida they stand on the beach and take
pictures you think they you well guys
guys Instagram is banned because
uh uh you know also I don't have your
number so I guess I can't chat with you
oh no Instagram is banned well suck so
suck I guess I'll just stay inside and
look at the
wall oh wait we have vbn yeah the law is
useless and it probably violates the
Constitution so I fully expect that law
to um
disappear anyway back to the video
absolutely ridiculous I mean the santis
yeah great government just don't just
just just stay out of social media okay
maybe it's not your thing not your thing
okay remember the days when this game
felt like all the entertainment you
would ever need let's see what else also
I heard about this Governor they they
submitting they were trying to ban
phones in
school and so the teacher or people used
artificial intelligence to cite studies
about how phones caused suicide also
according to Matt wal phones caused the
death of Halloween and trick-or-treating
so you know phones are the evil scum of
society and should be
banned according to Matt
wson uh wait wait yes so yeah phones
basically caus the death donation blah
blah blah phones bad phones bad anyway
so they're trying to show how phones
cause all these killings and children to
die using artificial intelligence and um
the studies were
fake and I tell you if I was the school
student body president of that school I
would go and I would go online and
say I I go to chat TBT and co- it and
have them write a speech for
me denouncing the use of artificial
intelligence to lie and try to ban Fones
because like you can't have rules for me
but not for D also phones obviously
should be in school not in class put
them up but lunchtime stuff like that
should be in school anyway back back to
the video that was supposed to be the
purpose of today's episode to be turn
the nor was supposed to jump in play the
and stuff like that we were so excited
but maybe I'll never be back all I need
is $50 million I will buy them out I
will buy them out it's dual SIM for all
the highflying business people that this
has clearly been designed for to G TR
charges with USBC which is it's wild you
know hey guys the Barbie phone has more
advanced than iPhone 14 highly
unexpected um no I don't I think it's
unexpected hmd is a uan company and uh
if it has electricity has have USBC it's
a law
people he forbid you use micro USB or
lightning it's got one pre-loaded
contact it just says Ken they have an
actual phone number registered to this
contact BRB just transferring everything
I have to my Barbie phone been nervous
what if he picks up call
home oh would be really funny if he Rick
Roll us right here that' be kind of
funny or kin rolled us
K okay there buddy what a weird thing to
put on a phone obviously the first thing
anyone's going to do when you add Ken as
their contact is call that number is it
like so like girls can show other girls
that look I've got Ken's number I don't
know that doesn't make
sense like I'm not an expert but you
know in order to run a school in order
to run the intelligence agency you kind
of have to know something
like I I don't think that's how they
think maybe we can ask jpt who
knows come
on come
on bro stupid
internet
can okay there buddy what a weird thing
to put on a phone obviously the first
thing anyone's going to do when you add
Ken as their contact is call that number
is it like so like girls can show other
girls that look I've got Ken's number I
don't know how girls think I yeah should
talk to some you know it's also super
weird so I'm trying to add a new contact
and you can add someone who's born in
1990 you can add someone who's born in
1980 but you can't do earlier than that
which that's weird also I've never
actually tested that on on my phone
before so may maybe you know old people
just don't they don't have phones you're
above 40 you don't get a phone shows you
everything you need to know about who
this phone was designed for this Barbie
medit but yeah butless say a 17-year-old
girl who for some dumb reason wants this
phone and you buy it what your mother is
going to be over the age of
40 you will hear a gentle gong sound at
the start and the end of the
session so that's the start yep okay
it's a timer I don't know how I feel
about it wow a timer is wow to be honest
it's very Charming just how much effort
and thought has gone into the thing like
this whole series of Barbie tips for a
better life for example but at the same
time it does feel very toy likee and the
functionality yes your daily screen time
on your phone that has three apps it's
no better than a phone half the price of
it 6 out of 10 I'd say l now all the way
up at $450 an hour it's time for the
Disney Princess phone by xiaomi
specifically by the looks of things
focusing on Snow White if you somehow
don't know Snow White by the way it's
the story of a po princess who fleeing
from her jealous stepmother the evil
queen who becomes absolutely obsessed
with trying to be the most beautiful
woman in the land takes Refuge with
seven dwarves only for the queen to try
multiple times to kill her so can you
see that really faint outline of Snow
White in this mirror oh yeah yeah I was
watching this on my phone that's
referencing how every time the evil
queen asked her magic mirror who's the
fairest in the land the mirror would
show Snow White so inside this logo is
so cool cure poison so that's Snow White
with the queen there an insert which
tells the story eh I think I did it
better yours was long though come at me
Walt got to say though I love how dark
and gritty they've made this thing you
know when you buy a Disney themed phone
you expect it to like a uh Windows Phone
unicorns and fairies but I think what
they've done here is even better so this
box has the Sim ejector which is a sword
through the heart ouchie it's the same
emblem that was on the box which the
queen wanted to put Snow White's heart
into which yeah this movie was a lot
Bleaker than I remember what else a
sheet of stickers manuals and then the
case oh damn this is special it's got
like a Louis Vuitton I wonder if it kind
of what's it called wre wireless
charging I wonder if it allows to that
cuz nice circle around it kind of
like mag safe on an iPhone style
patterning on the inside and it's
actually Tastefully done not to mention
the other side which looks even more
premium this looks like the poison apple
down here which after the whole taking
her heart out thing failed was the Evil
Queen's Plan B for ending Snow White's
life and it looks like it doubles as a
popsocket it's really embellishing
that's creepy the whole freaky after
hours Disney film kind of vibe they got
going on here and we haven't even got to
the phone so below the thing is a
generic looking cable and charger so let
get to it but at least I had a
charger hey guys today we're going to
learn how to add this scrolling
animation to your website in Wick Studio
without writing a
wow we even halfway to video yet come on
Hopefully the rain didn't knock out the
internet got to the phone so below the
thing is a generic looking cable and
charger so let's get to
it I'm so confused there are seven apps
on this phone nothing else Snow White
and
Seven ABS oh I just realized the battery
icon is actually a poison apple that's
unique and the charging animation is oh
God it's that poison apple again but
this time it's bubbling man if this is
what the thing actually looked like and
Snow White still put it in her mouth I
think it's fair to say she had it coming
there's apparent met wal doo in his
video so M who boss met wal go new
camera filters
princess oh it's actually distorting my
entire face it's someone said the
edit I don't know what did they say in
the
comments enlarging my forehead it's
bringing in my chin the lipstick oh I
saw the just made his forehead biger in
on the camera as well I mean it's quite
impressive in a way but I feel like the
entire takeaway of the story was not to
be obsessed with your looks so slightly
ironic too and you also have Queen right
next to it which
is look like a killer
clown so if you take a photo on princess
it gives you this like Rosy cheek effect
and if you take a photo on Queen you
just look all dead now here's what I'm
most curious about this phone has an
actual mirror on the back which is
absolutely amazing by the way you know
there's times where you really want to
see if you've got some fluff in your
hair and your selfie camera doesn't
quite cut it this is actually useful as
well as being so thematically F you know
your phone screen and be like because
it's like black and reflective because
mirror mirror on the wall was what the
evil queen used to say every time she
asked who was the fairest of them all
but what I've been wondering is does
this mirror also allow you to take
selfies using your high quality rear
cameras oh wow so I actually have to get
my face really far back for this to fit
okay just about oh wow yeah not that's a
good selfie I don't know why he doesn't
like it at all what are you talking
about just crap in
maybe kind of like do a bit of editing
yeah it's a good selfie I mean I can do
that too even without the camera let's
see if I can wait no I don't have to
flip it
around all right I've even done videos
like this yeah I did yeah that remember
that video of me doing like this yeah I
did a great
job of being able to take the selfie so
I don't know I don't know what he's
talking about the actual camera angle is
way wider than the mirror angle feel was
like a missed opportunity little bit of
a let down from what is otherwise an
elite tier limited edition I've just
realized it takes bites out of the apple
as the battery percentage goes down nine
out of that's the first time you
actually want to lose
battery now as we learned from Snow
White beauty isn't all about looks which
is why I am resolving to finding Beauty
in other places like beautiful game
football if you were lucky enough to see
Argentina's football World Cup victory
in 2022 FIFA called it the greatest
final ever both Argentina and France
were absolutely going for it they scored
three goals each two of which from
Argentina came from Lionel Messi and so
the final came down to penalties where
Argentina made it look like they were
shooting right but instead dipped it be
you know like guys kicking them still
shame to fle into the bottom left corner
to take that trophy home and this phone
is a celebration of that and you can
tell it's not a rush job too so on the
top of the insert it says Argentina
World Champion 2022 and then on the back
is all the players on the team at the
time the substitutes get a shout out
that's cool we got a super themed up
charger the cable is color match 2 and
the
phone I wonder if anyone in L that uses
this phone or bought it also shiai has
lots of themed phones that we never see
here in the United
States o very nice oh there's actually
some more down here there's the Sim
ejector tool which is a really
threedimensional socer ball football on
the back and inside is a Saker ball a
plain black
case I'm quite impressed why is the case
Vu like the camera thing is so big it's
half the half the case the details on
this so this number 10 is Lono Messi's
number presumably because he was labeled
as the best player in the entire world
cup and it's got a really unique texture
the rest of this is basically designed
to look like Argentina send out
different numbers per po pH like maybe
he gets 10 I don't know who nine is but
2022 kit and it's even got three dates
going across here 1978 1986 and 2022 the
three times they've won the World Cup wa
not too sure about this there's
something a little too Dead behind the
eyes kind of looks like Greg you know
with that long neck standing here and
then okay there's a custom gold clock
there white circular icons demon doesn't
look that good I mean I can make that
well something similar try and make them
look like little footballs got to say
though it's super strange how they've
themed like 90% of the icons and then
they've just left the final few that's a
red carard defense right there all they
needed to do was to just set a rule so
that the phone Auto recolors any app
that isn't already this blue color and
that's basically it it's not a bad
limited edition it going have some type
of a uh augmented reality SOC game but
it's also far from a winner this would
be like a some fball cuz that' be nice
the AI glasses that Miss mkb review had
some AR golf AR pong quarterfinals C of
phone five out of 10 but what's even
more tantalizing than a football win
seeing your two favorite superheroes
Deadpool and Wolverine finally come
together for a movie and I've got to say
these guys absolutely crushed the
marketing of it the Deadpool themed
cheeky Xbox controller the
on Reddit which is getting asro toed
highly suggestive popcorn buckets they
made I I don't know why his brain is in
the gutu but what is that even supposed
to be suggesting oh wow guys have
popcorn in my mouth so suggestive
like what that's not suggestive at
all what would it
suggest I was fully cracking up choking
like hey guys I'm choking oh my goodness
I'm I'm sure someone on X would like to
debate me on this so you know mean we
you lost the battle of the crop top so
maybe you can lose the battle of the
popcorn to and as part of that marketing
they also released a smartphone okay so
inside we got a board I knew about the
game games control but not there a
custom tag on top that's cool and then
this is the synopsis of the movie as if
anyone would actually buy this thing
without already knowing what happens
I'll buy it oh kind of looks like
Germany's flag right there this is sick
so there's a right draw and a left draw
the right has a wolverine tag on it so
that's got huh okay just a white power
brick with a logo on it and then a plain
white cable but then the left drawer has
the Deadpool tag and it has a Deadpool
Sim ejector as well as a generic looking
case okay so then we've got I like how
they send in cases and
Chargers o nice C it driving the Nissan
roog with
Google gole turn on Rocky's
food every more colorful new phone I've
ever had I've had you know kind of the
or glow black glasstic color of the a71
5G and then green which was nice on the
S2 Plus now I'm back to
Titanium I like the design of the rear
like even though these images of
Deadpool and Wolverine are flat the way
that the lighting bounces off them is
actually very threedimensional and you
might be thinking Aaron this isn't a
beautiful phone ah yes but you haven't
seen how Deadpool looks underneath his
mask cuz that that is something special
oh there is nothing on the phone itself
this just looks like a compl the game
what's it called Marvel snap I'm not
sure experience not even a new wallpaper
which is just insulting to be honest
considering that you can now generate
one in about 5 Seconds unless these
three prongs here are a reference to
Wolverine's claws yeah this is what
desperation feels like so my take is
that yeah I don't think so the High
purpose of this phone was to generate
hype for the movie so they got their
best crack team to make an awesome
packaging experience and phone back
design and then that was their job done
that's enough to make something that
generates some easy hype so much for
maximum effort it's pretty disappointing
considering how much customization can
be done on a phone and how much was done
for the much simpler merch products
three out of 10 but now we're moving on
to the $1,000 plus offerings starting
with the yeah I saw these I actually saw
some people using them in the Olympics
go Team
USA Samsung Z flip 6 Olympics edition
only 177,000 of these were made and they
were given exclusively to Olympic
athletes sorry oh my God but yeah on
first glance this does seem like a
really strange product but I can see why
they do it it's not for people to donate
to their cats but nice
try handing a free custom rare phone to
people is going to generate coverage and
this is coverage from all public figures
speciic specifically at the time where
most people are paying attention to
those public figures while tying into
the thing people are paying attention
for you'll notice this is a much thicker
box and what normally comes with the
Samsung pH that they've given out they
actually talked about how these phones
they gave out the 21 last time well
actually basically the same specs like
you go down a camera sure you have a
better processor but the phone is narrow
it's not as you know doable like people
holding these on their Olympic boats
which
um not as dust resistant so yeah because
there's two parts here so this top is a
collab between Samsung and belti a
French leather maker cuz you know it's
the Paris Olympics and this is actually
quite a cool collab cuz you might I
think I would do okay if I had a f in
Fone like this I don't get I don't get
enough calls though I know that Samsung
has a style of smart case called the
flips suit and this while being a nice
looking premium case in its own right
also grants the phone a matching live
wallpaper to go with it and the phone
itself is in the compartment below that
a brave bright yellow looking device
that's new it's like a full-on
inspirational speech this is your moment
you the athletes are the heart of the
Olympic and Par Olympic movement you
don't an enjoy your new Samsung Galaxy Z
flip 6 I mean it is an insane gift to
give people but it's just funny how
they're trying to make a link between
the Olympic movement and their
Smartphone when the closest link is that
you've got two of the five rings on the
back wow that is cool though that is
very cool I guess this is meant to look
like a running track now the actual back
of the phone looks pretty bad I have to
say I assume the color was meant to be
gold kind of like you make it better
gold yeah come on Samsung metal but it
actually just looks bright yellow and
all of this just reminds me of you know
there's people who get adverts plased
over their cars to earn a few extra
bucks thankfully though this case is
beautiful it's got a leather-like
exterior a felt likee interior and that
should switch the existing wallpaper
which is already very cool and Olympic
themed to this it's like the opening of
a movie the phone's also got a custom
Olympic themed always on display I
wonder if I could try that for say my
phone because it is NFC see if it see if
it works as well as a pretty basic theme
applied to the icons oh FR wait so
Samsung actually preloaded every single
one of these phones with 100 gigabytes
of 5G data there's a whole bunch and
they had a private 5G Network that that
was used to stream the Olympics from the
boats uh with s24 Ultras to different
apps that allow the athletes to know
what they're doing and share photos with
each other and also a prepaid unlimited
public transport card man I think it's
time for me to start training any chance
competitive Pokemon is going to become
an Olympic sport oh and this is
a so this whole thing was designed just
for the 2024 Olympics so you venture
into these portals the portals take you
to different worlds and then apparently
if you score 10,000 points within the
game you could redeem that at the
Olympics for a set of limited edition
pins oh no way these are the actual
athletes that's cool now I'm just
imagining like the entire rowing team
missing their event cuz they were too
busy collecting pins on their shiny new
Galaxy Z flips or selling their Limited
Edition phones on eBay for apparently
over $10,000 a pop8 out of
10 okay ideas where are we going I got
one I got
one what about a comedy show I've swiped
on
you now if you thought that was limited
at 177,000 units this next phone was
made just 800 times that is extremely
low for a smartphone I got to say right
off about I'm not getting a great Vibe
it looks fun but also really tacky and
cheap so this is a figure of to be
honest I know very little about it so
I'm going to pull up our sponsor the
Opera browser command plus slash to
bring up Opera's integrated Arya AI who
is this a model like what is this
picture
what is that it says the model is dormon
good confirmation but I probably could
have worked that out by reading the
front of the box so what never heard of
him until you know I start a video more
curious about is why do people love him
so much okay durmon is a beloved
character because he entertains while
teaching moral lessons by tackling
common issues like friendship kindness
and problem solving really M literally
every you know kid's character TV show I
mean could say that it just changed Doon
from PAW Patrol and people in the
comments say that
Doon they didn't like him they lik Doon
they said that he ticked off the entire
Southeast Asian market so I guess he's
popular there but they didn't like the
description because he has like special
powers I guess they forgot to talk about
so you know get better off
but as of 2024 the durmond manga has
sold over 300 million copies making it
one of the best selling manga series
durmond versus loose who would win of
all time so we also got a Duran limited
edition flip suitc case that's
interesting we'll see what this does in
a minute and then the Samsung Galaxy Z
flip phone which comes in its own
separate retail box but there is more
uh what am I looking at yeah this looks
like it's deconstructed during travel
also is not very premium regardless it
looks like this magnet was meant to just
stick onto here so dormond can go on top
and then this is his backdrop okay well
anyway let's dive into the main package
to see if Samsung rescued the software
oh my God it's even worse than I thought
I feel a little lightheaded just looking
at the thing this might be the poorest
user interface design I've seen I mean
it looks like something I could have
made 5 years the same is true for this
flip suit live wallpaper there's so much
happening and it's also happening at a
very low frame rate which makes it even
harder to watch someone said flip phone
in the I thought it might be like some
slow flip phone it's a Samsung phone
with a slow frame
rate shaking my head thanks to fujico
Pro for persistently reminding me that
it's copyrighted actually why don't we
just use arya's image generation make me
a dman wallpaper that's this resolution
and voila yeah there you go that's
literally 100 times better than what was
there before any Opera's integrated AR
AI is just one reason to give the Opera
browser shop it's also got tab Islands
quick shortcut oh it's the rest of the
user interface my God that is terrible
while I do have to give Samsung credit
that they at least did try something
different this is the only time I've
said this I actually would have
preferred it if they hadn't how did we
end up in a world where the Barbie phone
had more
class 2 out of 10 limited edition that's
a $1,000 phone right there you just
knocked off a table show some
respect season is underway with the
touch back and they take it from
intercept I wonder how they decide to
choose like what softw stuff to pre-o on
while this next one is not technically
it works phone this does feel like one
of the most uniquely bizarre
collaborations that I have to show you
so post Malone you know the famous
artist is a massive gamer but he has
apparently struggled to keep up that
gaming while he's touring the world
performing so he decided to partner up
with backbone a gaming controller
company to make this and $1,000 for a
game control is wild like the phones
that you be playing that would be
playing that odd would cost less does it
not look an awful lot like it just came
straight from a war zone when have you
ever seen a piece of tech package like
this and then you open it with this
lever feels extremely authentic that was
satisfying oh this is like a ration pack
this is how you often get food when
you're out camping or if you're an
astronaut and so if we cut inside oh wow
he really went to town with this
presentation that's for sure layers upon
layers of it and then inside of this box
we have the controller itself I mean Des
imagine trying to ship that thing and
you could have just shrunk R it fine
wise I got to say I wish all celebrities
put this much effort in but you should
watch the video about celebrity Tech if
you want to see what that's about you
can tell post Malone cared about this
I'm loving the transparent green case
it's green because that's post Malone's
favorite color there's some cool hidden
text when you expand the controller and
this P&M are actually apparently
glow-in-the dark let's try it let's see
I think I do prefer this to LEDs that
are just wasting battery for something
you can't even see analog sticks feel
really smooth and console quality
shoulder buttons are really plush and
comfy and hey this thing gives you your
headphone jack back I'm not so sure
about the face yeah it does kind of look
cheap also it's kind of like translucent
I don't know do people like translucent
stuff buttons on the d-pad though
they're made of aluminium on this
Edition which is incredibly bougie but
they're quite tiny and they have really
high resistance which reminds me a lot
of Nintendo's joy-cons not a compliment
oh you can use this button to take a
screenshot what game is that anyway oh
that's really handy why can't you just
hold down to take a screen recording
that would be such an obvious handy
feature for people wanting to share
their gameplay Okay so we've looked it
up it is actually meant to be able to do
that like hold down and take a screen
recording it is not working for us but I
did find on the way that these guys
actually charge a monthly subscription
for Imagine playing money to subscribe
for your1 thousand hand head handset
most of their features which don't
really look like they need one it's not
a cheap subscription either making this
a very expensive controller considering
that by default when it was launched it
was $200 but then because it was limited
to 500 units we had to pay over 1,000 to
actually get it six out of 10 on balance
but this next one should be the epitome
of beauty so Jimmy cheu the fashion
brand that charges $11,000 for a pair of
boots $4,000 for a little bag has worked
with honor to create a luxury flip phone
and this one actually comes in not one
but two boxes so let's start with the
smaller one this is very nondescript but
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
excited um why do I have a feeling I
could sell this bag for as much as I
paid for the phone this is bizarre
there's something inside this is is it
looks like a second longer strap for if
you want to wear the bag of your
shoulder Char I assume it's very weird
cuz what does this have to do with the
phone oh oh it's a it's a flip phone so
the phone will actually fit inside this
bag that's cool right so then the second
package has the phone on top it does
initially look like there's something in
this insert but I can't see a way to
open it and then on level two that's a
pretty basic looking Sim ejector for Mr
cheu I'm quite surprised and then just
manuals in there this is Co there's
twoes I like that they col Andes in here
so one is a mapped hard plastic case the
other is oh the braver choice the more
textured bedazzled option with a ring
it's actually pretty good like value you
get like thatone cost like 1,00 maybe
1,200 so if you wanted the case the bag
and stuff like that not overpaying like
too much like that would double as your
phone holder too huh plus a lanyard it
really is quite well thought I mean
don't get me wrong I don't think I'm the
target Jimmy cheu customer but I could
totally see that someone who is willing
to spend north of $11,000 on a pair of
shoes would very much enjoy matching
their phone case with their handbag with
their phone with their outfit and at the
very bottom a shoe pendant because they
make shoes I guess and now for the
device
itself for that imine spending that much
on a phone and you get one camera
embarrassing fancy so the wallpapers on
the inside and the side screen also
match everything else it's nothing super
high effort but I can see the appeal and
there's also a custom gold watch face on
the front here but they forget to add
the numbers how am I supposed to tell
the time off an unlabeled octogonal
Emerald I do like the fact that there is
barely any I there just never been said
before incase when you open the phone
which can't be that's nice for the last
few flips that were based off Samsung
phones this though this right here I do
not understand whose idea was it after
our pal Jimmy has gone to all the effort
of making a custom phone custom handbag
two custom cases exclusive wallpapers
and more to put the icons like this off
center not filling the row and covering
the wallpaper I can't lie though very
cool limit overall I'd say I tell it's a
9 out of 10 let's go so yeah they did a
great job maybe you know what I'm going
to endam a little bit now in a little
bit time so I can go and play with my
phone and you know just learn more about
it maybe we'll have some more articles
coming up for you will be posted up as
an article so um hopefully we guys we
have a good episode U Ava harer has been
doing some great
Generations have we are we supposed to
talk about anything else
today um maybe our B turn to Nory will
come back November 9th um yeah 2022
maybe we'll play the tape of um the kids
and the press
conference um
let me see what else we supposed to do
here I also like that grock can like do
