<h1>This Week IN TheTechBoy Podcast 32925 IVE SPROUTED!!!</h1>
<pre>hello everybody and welcome to the this
weekend The Tech booy podcast we have so
much to get to today from books to some
uh new tech news today going to be a
much better podcast episode but you know
today's art uh episode title is called
I've sprouted that is because today is
March 29th 2025 and one day ago last
year I went on to not to be for the very
last official time and when NTB
unceremoniously kicked me off for being
two young and then when I tried to
return I got kicked back off again and
since then the tech booy media has grown
and expanded we are at as of taping time
right now 666 followers over on X and
plenty and plenty followers over on our
new competitive alt Tech social media
website not the boy which is going to uh
be a competitive to not the be and even
though uh they have blocked me and even
though you know they don't I guess
recognize my existence anymore I have
been featured on their website thank you
to RIT lies for featuring me on there as
well for my screenshot and I have been
uh really really enjoying their articles
as well and you know it's it's really
sad I think this really goes to show
that you know you know you know governor
of California and Arkansas and New
Jersey or New York or whatever
H the santis hakabe all these people
with some H names or whatever they can
try to ban people okay off of social
media they can try to you know create
these ridiculous laws like uh I I heard
actually that Nevada Nevada actually
introduced this law where uh you know
app stores are now going to have to
start checking for um I'm GNA have to
start checking uh user IDs and ages if
you're 18 they won't let you download
Tik Tok or Instagram or whatever and to
that I
say well you know Android Supremacy you
know Android users rise up you know it's
time to defeat the governor of Utah it's
time to um bring in uh sorry Nevada not
Utah uh bring
in uh bring in new information you know
Android users rise up it's time to um
take it and you know Android Supremacy
and speaking of Android Supremacy I have
this new thing here that couldn't come
from Apple that couldn't come from Linux
you know it could only come from the one
the only Android and that is the
Motorola Razer
2025 and not by motor this is actually
called The Vortex V3 in the style of the
M Razer so you know back to that social
media band back to those app bands they
will not stand they will not work kids
are resilient you know uh I was 17 when
I got banned here and guys look I'm
still here 365 days because no actually
no 364 days because leap you happened
before that 364 days later we sou stand
and nothing nothing the forces shall not
destroy us and they have not destroyed
us look look you know you can try to ban
social media sites and smart teens like
me are going to make their own social
media websit you can try to ban little
app stores you know for IDs and then
just going to go on and commit felonies
and great fake uh IDs for that as well
you know you can try to ban you know
Instagram Tik Tok X whatever but you
know it it just will not stand it will
not work we have Android phones you know
all those websites have uh all those
apps have websites you know we will
overcome teens or like OU and they have
resilient so hey guys let's just not do
this go focus on actual laws um and and
not this ridiculous uh let's ban teens
off the internet and let ban them off of
social media because even teenagers can
give uh idiots a big uh whooping on
social media and that is what I did here
uh I actually had to go in and defend
Tik Tok from my uh mortal enemies you
know how much I hate Tik Tok but you
know what I hate more uh people who go
around and act like uh black people or
like
the best like you know God's chosen uh
people God's chosen race or something
like that these ridiculous blacktivist
running around Z here's some context
there's this guy named Ashton Hall who
uh had this Saratoga Water I never knew
that existed but whatever there's uh and
and he dun dunked his face in it and
then he
um uh he he dunked his face in it and
then he uh hope you guys can see this on
the screen
he dunked his face in water and then
rubbed it with the banana does doesn't
really matter what he does you've seen
the video has a billion views here so
now people are now parting this uh
social media meme hopefully you can see
this on the screen is
this I don't know what is this
anyway people have been parting this
people like brand have been paring this
McDonald's and queen of enjoyment with
her black self has now gone on here and
started to Yap about nonsensical stuff
quote without black people social media
would be doomed boring and uninspiring
now as many many people have um pointed
out you know including me being a tech
blogger first and foremost yes this is
still the tech company it's still a tech
Media Company without uh without white
people the internet wouldn't exist
without white people social media
wouldn't exist so you know this whole oh
well you know social media be well okay
even though that point is stupid and
dumb uh you know you should probably be
a bit more thankful uh because you know
without them you wouldn't have a
computer you wouldn't have internet to
go Yap about how you know before black
people came on social media I guess you
know it was just dull and boring and
something uhhuh and I shot back multiple
times but this is my most uh famous one
I looked up famous Tik Tock media Stars
2020 because that's the the thing right
we have Addison Ray who I actually know
who that is okay she was in that uh Liv
well Liv was pretending to be here with
the national Amon Video Charlie deila
I've actually heard of her but porch
never heard of her Zack King never heard
of him Dixie De Milo I'm guessing that's
Charlie de Milo's sister Lauren Gray and
Michael Le also never heard of them as
well but look it doesn't matter if I've
never heard of them millions and
millions and millions of people have
heard of these people as well and people
actually got absolutely mad they said
bro no one cares about this the dances
they do the music they do all black
uhhuh yes they think that Tik Tok dances
were just all got created by um black
people and then I pushed back and said
hey guys guys you guys Tik Tok is a
white girl app okay I I I really like to
have explain it to these people that Tik
Tock is is is for white girls like how
how is this hard H how are you people
this stupid like you I went up against
uh in eth grade from the SS
ltw uh
series uh from from ltw Ser I went up
against you know a Tik tocker we all
know that's what Tik Tok is for my like
for goodness
sake like okay guys okay guys X is for
Christian nationalist Instagram is for
racist and Tik Tok is for white girls
that that that is the entire thing like
this is entire meme that I made about
you know uh apparently if uh the United
States will lower tail of sunshine if
you can get a Tik Tock uh deal here you
know that is white team girl pack think
that how are you really trying to tell
me that you know Tik Tock is actually
all black but just all the white people
came along and stole the the ideas and
dances and these people are like oh well
you know some black person created
Charlie Milo's dances and then she just
blatantly stole them without credit do
you not know what Tik Tok is for okay
look I hate having to defend Tik Tok but
Tik Tok there are these things called
Tik Tock Trends someone does a dance
then you you you turn the video around
so you have your selfie camera pointing
out you see the dance then you do the
dance itself look I've seen some of them
before I've actually been in the
background of some of them before okay
how is this hard for you people to
understand and comprehend you cannot
steal a dance on Tik Tok it's different
than you know choreography or anything
like that like from Beyonce like no look
it is a Tik Tok train is a Tik Tock
dance you cannot steal Tik Tock dancers
you cannot steal Tik Tock Trends they
are Trends they are meant to be emulated
they meant to be copied you know if the
black person was good at their dances or
they had the the the like the the look
or or the skill and the talent uh that
Charlie Deo apparently had then that
black person would be famous here okay
but are you trying to claim that Tik Tok
is racist no they're not because look
this person went on and show me like
some press release sh that oh guys Tik
Tok has a you know diversity yada y y
yes of course they're going to put that
out there it's in the ads because that's
the way culture works you want to have
diversity or whatever but look uh you
know black people do not create all the
funny Trends and memes on the internet
wom sit down like are you stupid are you
stupid oh my
goodness I I I you look look look you
know I I just can't even okay to um
borrow their language
there you you really want to tell me
that Tik Tock is just just full of a
whole bunch of uh black people you know
doing Tik Tok dancers but you know all
the white people just came in swooped in
and stole them and stole the
culture yes that's that's uh totally
totally believable
and you know it's it's all these people
like these who are the most ungrateful
little twerps on the internet she thinks
that that her race has like
single-handedly done everything perfect
and and right and that they have created
Twins and things like of this nature but
somehow they just keep getting
stolen uhhuh yeah uh get back to me call
me when I care which will be never okay
look
Tik Tock daners and those little Tik
Tock
Trends are and have been primarily white
people and that's because they have the
majority and that's when someone say oh
we have the majority of course they're
gonna get more likes and Views and
things yes because everyone knows that
the uh Tik Tok base of 15 to 25 year
olds are racist now now if it was
Instagram yeah but the Instagram users
an Instagram comments
or those people are racist but funny
okay they don't they don't actually hate
anything they're funny racist the Tik
Tok people are just whole bunch of like
blue-haired anti-racist Pride flag
people and then like chili okay so uh
you know 0 for two again 0 for two uh on
your shot against uh against them but
you know I wish you well in your
endeavors against uh the the white race
and you know their contributions to
society and Humanity all right now let's
talk about the vortex
V3 all I'm I'm going to be selling this
thing because you know Mr mobile
promoted it it's $100 on eBay I'll have
the link underne in the description but
like for the um non retr phone
collectors why in the name of Vortex and
Samsung does this thing exist like okay
um I have T9 texted before because you
can actually do that on a phone T9
texted on here is different instead of
having to hit you know let's let's say
you want to write the letter A instead
of writing a by T tapping two if you
instead of tapping two three times to
get C what you do is you have to tap
two and then you'll get a text that
comes out so texting and typing anything
on here is impossible it's running
Android 11 so it has a like it's
probably fairly like more secure than
like any other random flip phone right
and it's based off the Motorola Razor
which once again is one of the most
overrated uh phones to ever just
exist uh I'm just putting in my pin here
and has this like weird skin here but
let's just get into like the real motor
Racer the real motor racer one of the
most overrated phones to ever exist was
better than this okay like it has the
same level of internet connectivity that
this phone would have had except for you
know just say Google Assistant this
thing is just all
plasticy uh it is super duper light like
I throw it if I wasn't like selling it
this is an investment uh the the button
too like
exited you can hear it rattle okay you
can actually hear this thing Rattle and
um like the keys the keys are actually
kind of feel pretty nice but they're not
really silver I mean yes it did cost
like $40 off of Amazon but like for for
the UI which is barely uh coherent like
okay I'm gonna put in my pen for some
reason like it's a numerical pin but I
cannot use the number keys to put it in
for some
reason that's it's another one of those
like skin things that it did here so
look at his skin uh oh it's slow it's
slow let's give it some time
okay I'm gonna go home again there's
also no home button
so so Sor sorry guys they're taking a
they're taking a they're taking a long
time oh my gosh okay so I downloaded APK
miror on here so if I can get some apks
to run off of it it no just no APK is
not scale well for thing all anyway
finally got to the UI got to the home
screen uh can do you guys see this I
know it's kind of hard to notice I'm G
to do it off Cy so look you see the
browser is not covered in white
everything else is covered in white what
do you think is selected you might think
that you might want to have everything
else not be covered in white and then
have the thing that you selected be
covered in white but no it doesn't in in
Reverse okay in these app icons and
grids
why uh you know the the the UI they they
definitely could have done a better job
because like a real flip phone like
running you know flip phone OS whatever
flip phone the mot Razer van probably
would have had a better UI whatever this
is like it's kind of a a flip between
like a senior cell phone and like some
really really cheap cell phone one thing
I will say is that the audio quality on
this device is actually pretty good uh
for a broken flip
phone uh I I don't know why they have a
mute button that is on the side like
this that's that big but whatever all
right so here was a song that I
downloaded on device I did not put my
SIM card account on here it's some from
some random Chinese company called
Vortex their website barely works so
yeah I know I'm going to have to
download a
testing
miles so actually out the the it's it's
actually pretty uh good on here now for
the camera quality there actually is a
camera on here for some reason and it's
well I'll show you some pictures all
right now this is more useless than what
was on the original razor so yeah that
that is the vortex V3 also you know like
super super flimsy and skinny and things
of that nature all right now let's go to
uh here here's Instagram here and I took
some pictures with the vortex V3 so uh
here here's my photo shoot of the vortex
V3 hope you guys can enjoy this
amazing uh hope you guys enjoy this
amazing thing so here's the United
States hat I mean look look at the uh
just wow okay it does actually take
videos on here not even worth showing as
well I also downloaded my incard and
video on here here's a picture of my
phone that is I mean look how far we've
come I mean it kind of really makes you
appreciate modern smartphones and here's
another picture of the device obviously
taking on the thing one thing about the
MP3 player is that it does play in the
background which I actually found to be
pretty interesting
like but like there are no controls on
on the
front it's a very bad MP3 player it does
record audio as well so it's pretty
useful I guess if you
can come on what's the hinge could be
likey guys we're recording uh it's like
a video camera so yeah interesting uh
device that we uh have here U The Vortex
V3 all right so we've gone through uh
social media we've gone
through
test do you know how sad it would be if
no one could hear what I'm was saying
let me just go check
make
sure all right good people people can't
actually hear what I'm saying so we've
gone through social media we've gone
through uh you know ridiculous Trends
we've gone through all sort of things
but you
know we we we still have so much to get
to today because like I've just battling
these people for so long and um you know
how does women's like oh black people
they have great they have great Trends
they they started great Trends and you
know social media be dull and lifeless
and boring without them I'm about to
show you like there's this thing
apparently everyone knows that uh that
people uh there's this trend called
Studio Gibby gilby it's a art Trend
right that was started by a uh nonblack
person in like in the physical world and
then chat gbt introduced a studio uh
gilby
uh uh fil to um headed up by non-black
open Ai and then a whole bunch of
non-black people started making their
profile pictures and taking some images
of it and doing animations of it with
them uh as well here is a image of an
example from the new York time so once
again this woman just got like destroy
uh on once again like I I I just saw
this one thing now and I'm going to talk
about some person who probably shouldn't
be T starting some twins here because
uh here's what the images look like
they're like nice little image animation
things here but I think one of the
interesting things that we've learned to
is that jgpt has a whole like a huge
user base a huge user base that pays $20
for it because I couldn't get this work
I'm not paying $20 a month for chat GPT
uh maybe I can get someone's test
account but they've been converting
those the images here and posting them
here and people have been like posting
their faces here to answer anonymity and
privacy Etc and if someone could figure
out like you know I don't know some
person who has unlimited time on their
hands with you know lots of
computational resources and only would
use this for the greater good of uh for
the for the great good uh could figure
out a way to reverse the studio gilby to
like the original images
you know that that could that could that
could be um that that couldn't be good
so um you know hopefully that person
doesn't exist anyway that that that's
the thing here now I'm talking about
someone starting a trend here and it is
a black person so I hope that Mr uh or
Mrs whatever her name is with her 13
million views sitting around whining
about how uh you know white people are
so boing on their social media
influences and if without black people
social media would be dead or
whatever Kira Kira won't miss
reports that uh hope you guys can see
this on the screen I show speed famed
streamer uh it reports single-handedly
destroying dead of anti-china propaganda
because he went to China and they showed
him
some like tourist sites and he went over
like live stream to millions and
millions of twitch people which one
thing that we don't need the one thing
we we needed is more Chinese propaganda
there's this video that's been going
around of people like showing let me see
if I can pull it up here of a of like a
Chinese elevator and a Chinese bridge
and they're like wow guys China is so
great in the United States we don't have
this uhhuh you know you know full well
that uh okay first of all China sucks as
a country and uh is show speed it's
either being paid or it's just like you
know being like LED around by the
Chinese government to put out propaganda
right and um you know he he could find
the same things here in the United
States just just ridiculous okay so if
this is the kind of twins that she wants
um I I'm I'm all I'm all against it um
let's see if I can find that video
all right let's see if I can
find is I mean it's just absolutely
ridiculous with the uh Chinese uh
propaganda that that we that's going on
here and he's just a terrible terrible
streamer apparently uh you know giving
out Chinese propaganda to millions and
millions of uh
people and no just not look only
propaganda that we want here is American
propaganda of course you know like I
said we we should have propaganda we
should influence other countries but we
shouldn't have have China influencing
other countries and having uh propaganda
for us as
well uh so yeah that that that is my
stance on that one as well so hopefully
she's happy with her uh black influences
all right now let's get into this thing
I know it's not really Tech related but
it wasn't ebook it was from an ebook
and yeah it it it it it was a book and
uh you know you kind of links that's the
ltw so that's just how we're going to
sell it but that's how we're going to
spin it it yep it it was a book that
existed and um let me get put up my
highlight too I've also compiled some
screen such and uh you know it it you
know like all right let's get let's get
into this
book also again written by a white
person so if this becomes a trend uh you
know make be sure to thank her for that
one as well all right
I'm going to tune to my media here this
book is called how to be popular it's a
book about a girl who's trying to become
popular I know it's it's it's
wild all
right and uh it's written by Meg
kabat
and this so we we start off this girl is
essentially trying to become H I'm going
to give you like a little synopsis of
the book before we get into some of the
screenshots this girl is trying to
become popular and then so she has this
book because she has uh been teased by
this like popular girl named Lauren for
making one mistake spilling some like
soda on her scope back in sixth grade
and she's been teased in a small town so
her name is essentially used as an
insult this kind of reminds me of that o
Liz episode everyone's like saying O Liz
like taking his name in vain instead
instead of saying oh my like you know
taking God's name in vain uh and he Lo
lesson well Essen that's what kind of
what happens to this person uh as well
I'm just going to go read through some
of the comments here as well so she she
has this book she's like financially
literate she's smart uh and she has like
puffy like frizzy hair or something like
that but she reades book she does a
makeover and she makes some interesting
decisions on her way on on a fight to
become popular we'll go over the ending
at the end but uh some of the uh
beginning of the book is are rough all
right so she's sitting in this car with
your friend uh
let me see if I can show this in the
screen and they're listening on the
radio here's a quote tonight we're
listening to this Favorite Year 1997 The
Sex Pistols God saved to Queen so I
thought oh okay maybe they did like a
rock version of the national Anem you
know that is Engish national anthem U
that's also what used to be the United
States national anthem my country T So I
looked up the lyrics 1997
because you know I thought this may have
been like a like a little throwaway line
you know kind of interesting I'm about
to read the uh the uh the first four
lyrics of the song quote God saved the
Queen the fastest regime they made you a
[ __ ] a potential
ITB like what who vote this
song What what what even is this all
right um on to the next um quote here
uh well you know you you guys have eyes
you can read this essentially you know
Jason is against uh High School dating
and I was like okay great you know boy
after my own heart something finally
something you know interesting here and
here it is on the screen I'll just let
you
um I like uh essentially uh why why why
why shouldn't you date in high school
he's like National Security it's useless
we're going to get into this later
useless he's like oh well you know you
can't do wrong stuff in high school easy
easily and apparently he also likes his
random blonde girl in college that works
in the thing here but then J Jason turns
around and you know boy after my own
heart after you know basically saying
you know you should do bad things uh you
know failed the purity test perfect 100
for me so you know I'm not going to be I
mean if you have like a 75 even on that
test like what are you doing like the
lowest thing you should probably have on
that thing is a 90 because they're like
oh have you held hands okay that's fine
99 Have You Been Kissed okay 98 and then
like that test kind of evolves like like
how how know you have lower than a 75 or
50 or even a 33 like two out of three
it's a
yes that's okay anyway so you're saying
back I needed some clarification that
you need never thought about uh dating
never had a cross on anyone in school
not anyone exactly Jason said I never
will uh just W Jason right there so yeah
did did he fail the pury test yeah did
he uh well I guess technically no but
you know he he kind of advocated it for
it but uh he didn't do anything wrong
because you know the quote here in green
and then
uh uh but then he kind of falls off here
this is all in like the second third
chapter of this book okay this book is
wild okay and I have some more things I
highlighted here just didn't screenshot
and yet he she still manages to maintain
her blonde highlight just one of the
main reasons that spent many a night
after the lying on the hill composing
hauz and on I'm sorry that's pathetic
imagine sitting on a hill I know this
town is boring and he has like a 1974
BMW and that's the highlight of his life
but imagine sitting around on like some
grassy n and riding a hi coup for
someone like what are you suzu rightel
like it could not be me imagine rting
some hi coup for some random waitress in
town uh he gets especially poetic when
Kristen rars a men's white butt down
shirt at the end TI just under ribs and
no bra well congratulations uh to him as
well and you know I'm glad for the kids
books everywhere at at all time and I'm
sure when Christy listens to this
podcast he's gonna be in here of Annie
crop top comments which fine all right
um yeah uh so um did did he spy on
Jason's shirt list in in his room yes is
that weird again
yes but but I mean did she uh troll
Catholics by doing it also yeah so uh
quote since I can't ask father the Chuck
might as well go straight to the top
there no more middleman that's what
Grandpa always advised anyway he is the
next Mar Lu of our generation of course
you know uh kind of like uh you know see
she's getting like 80s on the the py
test score thing here but you know you
know Martin Luther he he had his
problems as well you know that didn't
become relevant until 400 years later
but
yeah all
right and then she also spies on these
people she spies on Jason shess he gets
kissed by like the top quarterback you
know it's a really really weird weird
book here but I'm just going to read a
few more quotes from this book here and
in fact I posted one in Maria from the
ssw series kind of you know talked out
of uh out of um you know concern for you
know what I was reading because
obviously everyone knows sslw
anyway the kind of fantasy my mom won
the kind when my friends and I get
invited to find back to school parties
and it's like he's never heard of the
big super go incident interesting that
her mom wants to go to the parties her
mom is incompetent all right uh why is
there a fingerprint here oh I thought
like you could lock your book The you
might want to lock this book like all
anyway chapter three oh no you did not
do that
uh uh Jason practices thing he calls BMW
courtesy which means he let the BMW's
cut in front of him why and also how
rich is this town it's a Tiny Town like
the Midwest in Indiana once again the
Midwest is the best for like stories and
books and things like this how many
people and kids have BMWs in this town
like how BMW do not just grow on
trees and uh he even gives uh Lauren
maet her sworn enemy
uh BMW cesy as well and they PDA y y y
he here was a funny quote here uh oh
yeah we have some Sweden propaganda
Sweden must be the best place to live
because out here in the cool Midwest uh
popularity has nothing to do with
niceness oh well C me a river all right
uh what's so convenient about meeting
your soul in high school we've gone
through that if you date oh I'm serious
you date someone in high school where oh
now here here Jason D Jason right here I
mean in fact your logic I'm I'm serious
Jason say you date someone in what
happens if you break up you have to see
them every day how's that going to be
super tense you need it school sucks
enough without throwing that into the
mix now now school doesn't suck school
is amazing school is the stageing ground
for geopolitical Warfare but it the he
he is right exactly right here and I'm
glad to see that what I've been saying
has been true for since since I was born
when this book is written okay so you
know it's not like I'm just making stuff
up actually I did make it up but you
know confirms to reality so that fix
more characters in my head like on TV
and on on the radio and on
uh and books agree with me like you know
we you know this this what happens when
you only exclusively listen to Advent
and odyssey and Kids Corner uh until
you're like 15 okay you know you kind of
that kind of becomes your entire world
viie you know this podcast probably be a
bit different if I uh listen to Disney
channnel shows which I'm currently all
watching well not actually watching
watching them to someone else's podcast
where reacts Disney Channel Show's
called a SM she's hilarious
anyway here here was something to funny
quote to but um this kid here she's
super smart quote don't you get it lunch
is the most important time for the day
for social interaction in the school
setting W whatever her name is I think
it's Bella or Becca or whatever uh and
she she wants to get this uh boy here uh
see spies on people uh and in fact one
of the quotes here is uh he says you
bought some boy in an auction my mom
said repeating how can you buy a boy
Stephanie how could you which is uh
absolutely hilarious here and look her
name's Stephanie not backa all right
look Mar May disagree with what
Stephanie has done look she has done
some terrible terrible things here okay
like her school Purity score is going
down um down down down okay it's it's
going down like spying on people through
the bedroom window as undressing is is
vog now spying on people through their
bedroom window when they're not
undressing is fine um but look she spies
on people she has uh she she bought this
boy at the auction
which which she created by the way um
yeah it's like you know an auction it's
like the tal auction they had in so 101
which
is just hilarious anyway she buys this
boy at the auction so that she she can
help her mom store um financially
literate by the way she does the books
she works with the
grandpa but it's also said that she can
spend time with her kind of like how
when I got a recorded to tape student
council notes which I actually did us to
record to tape student council notes but
also to commit Water Gate and spy on
gcamp uh she she she has a book she has
a game plan and she she actively
achieves her goals now in the end you
know she does the right thing and um
lose it to popularity when she really
got roped into it like she really if she
had just been a bit better at talking
she could have still be the most power
powerful and proper kid into school and
become president but look she sets out
she sets out events in this school she
spies on people she goes out and she
gets what she wants she follows the
instructions she takes down her bully
Lauren mfet in fact uh even towards end
she she's still um taken down as well
and C is driven C has goals C has
opportunity that's what we need more in
these characters and this she a flawed
character yes did she do immeasurable
wrong yes but look what she did here was
she did for the greater good for herself
she what was for the great good for her
business and what she and what she did
is just impressively amazing yes C by
put at the auction yes did she um rig
Evin to go in her favor yes but is that
really truly wrong no not
really not
really and to that I commend her look
let's he go against SSA Doctrine like
would would would I just stand here like
defend some you know person doing what
she did no but look she's driven and
that's what we need to see we need more
characters that are actually driven to
do things like all like half of s ltw is
just like do something do something
anything you have a super majority and
you're just kind of like uh sitting
around you know scrolling on Tik
Tok like like get to work all anyway
back to SS
ltw uh Eve Angelico uh is a most uh
recent article here we also have a CSM
notice on here
uh chrisan social media that's the stand
in for not to be obviously uh
let's see did we go to this yeah we did
the gcam circle but like we we uncover
the secrets of gcam I want to see if I
can uh see see the image here you have
the new one
Evangelical I return back to school and
essentially like like what I
said like she did manipulate events to
go in her favor yes and this she is
trying to date people yes but look as
has never actually been anti- you know
dating like we've always been what is
pro SSA right obviously anti- teenage
dating uh isn't going to you know we're
not gon to run a campaign off of that
right like it's kind of like how Vera
ran her presidential campaign off of oh
well you know you know we love Jesus
we're gonna cover this Administration
prayer y yada y yeah look the teacher
not gonna vote okay they they they can't
vote here kids uh you no no no teenager
wants to have
a vote for like a political campaign is
just going to be like you know uh
religious like that okay um it's this is
not good politics like say what you're
gonna do for the prom or something as
well but remember like she was a plant
okay like to prevent me from winning
which but like no okay so this is like
it's not good politics for me to get out
there and they say I'm gonna like ban T
stting like couldn't anyway but you know
people did actually think in a previous
election I was gonna like ban abortion
on school property which
is what anyway
um like Anyway back to
this like you know SSA was like okay
okay guys look we we already see that
people are dating let's have like a
containment strategy right um but then
you know for the good of SSA and for the
good like we always focus on what was
for the great good of SSA like would me
dating the GK member be great for good
absolutely Li there's no situation in
which you know me dating anyone would uh
you know like Advance SSA agenta like
this person what's her name Bianca
Stephanie yeah Stephanie Stephanie was
always focused on one thing and I was
advancing Stephanie's agenda and that's
why she actually did stuff she actually
was productive and look did she burn
relationships in in in through her
process yes but look she achieved what
she wanted and if she was just a little
bit better on the issues if she had just
you know said no we can't give my dad's
Observatory for you to have a party in
here because uh I don't know the key
code like she could have lied or she
could have said hey hey hey tipped off a
grandpa anything else instead of like
just uh absolutely capit capitulating
and standing her ground Etc and not
being popular
anymore
but advancing gono to invade gcam using
SSA Intelligence on to to get SSA
intelligence be good for the greater
good of SSA absolutely and if it's for
the greater good of SSA if it's for uh I
keep forgetting this girl's name if it's
for Stephanie's greater good and if it's
going to advance her agenda in in the
school that's one thing I like about
this is that she understood her she
understood what who she was she
understood her her her her place in the
school and she took risks she Advanced
her agenda just like SSA Advanced our
agenda so that that is my advice to
people Advance your agendas okay as long
as you're not like trying to murder
someone Advance your agenda and that is
what we did and look did did did did
mistakes happen but did uh did did World
War II spark off yeah no not really but
you know kind of but look you know SSA
allied with gcam you know allied with
Denver right but when the time comes and
you'll see this in the next uh article
we have a full like SSA ltw themed
episode we can't do that today because
we have so much to get to uh SS ltw
themed
episode you will see how you know
sometimes you kind of switch switch it
up a little bit to advance the agenda of
SSA in for hour good right and the
agenda of SSA would then again advance
for school now speaking of SSA and ltw
and gcam you know one thing that would
have very majorly Advanced the agenda of
SSA that way majorly would have advanced
the agenda of SSA would be if uh gcam
accidentally added me to the group chat
which happened except in real life
before ssw could have predicted it so
that's unfortunate you know don't don't
add random journalists to your group
chats people here but here's an example
of what SS ltw uh parody it would have
been it would have really great if uh we
got access to G C International like IM
message thatw do you know how like we
could have solved so many problems we
could have solved so many problems we
would have had all the intelligence that
we needed we' have known all the
relationships and then we could have
just like just just do it like you know
you could just do things H if we had
access to that tax Ming Network like we
wouldn't have had to like send set up
some kid to invade gcam who R 25 out of
10 which kind of like broke the app to
who didn't we criminally investigated
because he was like kind of a felon and
he uh PL spoiler here he he did write
the phone phone number of some random
girl on the table here while in the
meanwhile you know CSM is like he
whatever and then you know CSM just like
kicks me off the site you know that that
would have been you know so much easier
and so much better if they had just
leaked their text messages please
anyway like that that would have made
life so much easier if they leak their
text messages here here's a video of uh
[Music]
isn't
a yes stole a
car
look see we just have all this doe on
people like this is actually based on
real things teen teenagers sing out and
you know uh I create a fake mystery or
whatever and he scan people with doing
things with photos you know those kind
of photos you probably shouldn't be
sharing with people which once again if
you if you don't have elicit photos they
can't get
leaked let's
go HW news just joined in I'm like well
oops oh no we uh we we leaked a a plan
to Hawk news that that would be uh that
that wouldn't be good as well anyway but
you you can see like look some was
planning on spying on SSA spy choice of
mass destruction we couldn't let that
happen so of course we had to uh invade
gcam uh you know our invasion of gcam is
better than ninth grade's invasion of
gcam because uh well we we'll get to
that later all
right so yeah spy toys of mass
destruction will never come back from
that one all right now here's an article
from the
Atlantic that's not about the uh you
know
leak e it is it's about and this is this
is one of the funniest articles that I
have ever read my life like what oh it's
my second favor article and also once
again I always like reading you know RIT
to read about how stupid teenagers
are like like I'm I'm like is it wrong I
just would like to read these and show
how much better I am then I'm like good
grief I like I truly I'm better than
you I
like look did I like this a real thing
that happened on quote did I uh
have a party when in someone else's
house when I thought my parents went
here and then bring a horse inside no
well
see I'm just better that way I'm just
better anyway look listen to this
headline how teens tuned Instagram into
a dating app yes teens turned Instagram
into a dating
app uhhuh turned it in who would have
thought that an app with lots of
pictures of pretty and ecstatic people
that has messaging options on it but be
turned into a dating app who who could
have seen that one coming who who would
have thought that a p
but like duh of course you got toned
into a dating app what what do you mean
how they toned it into a dating app hey
I see person I like I see message option
I seen message I start dating
Atlantic like how was this an article
but but then but then they go deep into
the jiny uh Teenage dating which I how
does that even work for whatever like
how take you but like when when you're a
teenager and let's assume you have
hundreds on theity test SC things here
so you're not doing anything you
shouldn't be doing it is literally
impossible to cheat on someone like what
what what do that mean oh you hug
someone else and texted them in their
Instagram
DMS oh wow I I am I am truly hurt and
broken up about this you call you people
call that
cheating like once again you know it's a
bad thing because you know it can cause
a whole bunch of High School drama like
just like Jason said but
like the the the entire premise of like
cheating and a teen dating relationship
just doesn't make sense it doesn't
really compute because like Teenage
dating just it has no goal it has no
onset like what what is the goal like oh
we were planning on get to get married
it's not going to work right uh and
actually no no teenager goes into dating
thinking that so like what are they
going into for I'm here to have fun
alone or something well if you're here
to have fun alone
then
like didn't like cheating on someone
just it's not possible to cheat on
someone if you're in the teenage dating
relationship I'm sorry anyway uh back to
back to the
Atlantic how do you let a classmate and
I actually did not know this is what's
sliding into DM's meant so apparently
the way teenagers date on Instagram is
that they go find very cute humans yeah
did you have a question sign you search
for the person's profile privately
message them a meme you know dating in
2020 uh 2018 it's just it's just a
thing it was a thing uh and then they go
and like do different people's profile
photos and like text through Instagram
or something really interesting article
like what what what are you people
doing
like again how did the Atlantic doc
think that this would be turned into a
dating app and also why like imagine
seeing someone on Instagram and thinking
that you have a chance of dating them
because like if they show up on your
Instagram feed they're milons and milons
thousands and thousands of followers and
you know full well you and every other
person is sending messages to them and
um you know maybe I should do a study
here you know on Instagram to um this
might be a bit harder because you know
Instagram isn't direct race or Aids data
but maybe I attract how many white to
non-white people on on Instagram you
know that's you know for the twin sets
out there you
know yeah whatever yeah just like and
what are you doing of course it got
turned into a dating
application and uh yeah that that was
the thing all right now let's talk about
uh the the thing that we just saw
from uh the the video the fake text
video and you know always when something
happens like everyone remembers cting
the gate when uh you know they had uh
people in
calendars doing stuff like uh lying down
in like a bikini or whatever and then
people got mad about that because uh you
know everyone knows that uh if if you
see someone like a bikini or a crop top
your brain is gon to jump from oh wow
look that's a person to um oh wow look
I'm G to do something in a f everyone
everyone knows about that giant brain
link yeah I know oh wow what oh this
person has a stomach oh deep like
whatever like people are freaking out
about calendar gate let
just this is a woman in a calendar calm
down but you know whatever controversy
drives clicks and that's why when have
all these Gates happen you know like uh
Isabella movie at delca gate uh we an
article about that and got views and she
followed me so and Cen the gate you know
I kind of just tagged C the gate got
like 400 views on an article about
Samsung C had next nothing to do with
counton the gate but you know you know
controversy drives clicks so in those
text messages leaks you know that Tech
the tech boy was like well you know is
this bad for National Security yes who
cares uh how to create fake text message
videos if you want to make fake text
messages to Frank your friends create
parody videos of leaked text messages or
make Snapchat style text videos which is
a lot better than that woman who's
apparently a man we couldn't tell
because apparently he's 500 pounds and
he's on every Snapchat video I don't
know why like why is he on these things
with just like random woman who was like
oh wow my sister's GNA dat and the
sister's like you know like the woman
that's bringing him around is like you
know 120 pounds like normal weight so
it's like oh wow that's great and then
he brings in this like absolute dinosaur
of a creature like stomping in and like
in this weird film thing like where are
they find these people in the malls
anyway anyway uh you can use application
and texting story to uh to to do fake
text like this uh so make sure you check
out this application though ads I mean I
mean like like a little Watermark at the
top I tried to crop it out but you can
see it it's and if you want to change
like the colors and more Advan C you
have to pay like $299 for it or some
like subscription all right and card
versus Wikipedia honestly I'm kind of
disappointed in Wikipedia in this one uh
so Wikipedia is great it has more
information but like the information
density of incarta versus Wikipedia
check out the video because it's really
interesting and also inard National an
them really really good because it has
like you know
like the you know that but then it has
the uh sounds like like background
sounds or whatever so it's good you you
can check that out on the channel where
I did a recording of it maybe I should
do it for every count like Canada
Ecuador
Etc
uh anyway for for the incart naal an uh
but uh Wikipedia and in kiwix I
downloaded it with images 102 gigabytes
so it's 50 times bigger than the 2
gigabyte download of incart and that's
including Ina kids it's including you
know all the flash games that don't work
anymore inart the every single country
on Earth
Wikipedia has none like they couldn't
even include a sound file that's like
that's just wrong that's just wrong and
also I kind of like that GI better so
you know uh sometimes L is more than
that might sound like a minimalist
influence to you know like hey guys you
know less is more make sure you only use
your flip phone this is this is all you
need trying to call an Uber on here
would take like 50 minutes but you know
who needs an Uber and also it's like
super plasic in the bad terrible all
right and for our third article how to
open up pin pin apps on a Samsung phone
just basically turn your phone into a
kiosk it lets you like save them uh to
to the screen as well there so uh very
interesting uh stuff there for Samsung
make sure you check that out all right
now let's talk about this and I've
actually thought about this for a long
time um you know kind of like how it's
really hard to find information about um
satellite video uh chat and things of
that nature or like walkie talk for
phones um that it would be really easy
to have like an app you plug it in USBC
microphone you have a walkie talkie
phone but like there's nothing nothing
else for that uh nothing else for that
like uh the Homing device in Advent
Odyssey that came out in like 1992 so
unlikely that they were using uh no 89
92 I'm not sure that came out around
that time it's unlikely they use GPS
though they were with the government so
maybe they did
uh essentially figuring out low Tech
ways to do what what what we can do like
you know everyone talking oh we can
video chat over the internet now but
there's no internet no video chat but
when like the first video chat machine
came out that worked through phone lines
like no internet came out in 1932 or
like how it was so much easier to dial
into a computer interface you know dial
in or whatever uh back in the 90s but
now like it's kind of like harder to get
remote access to a computer now or uh
satellite video you know uh Windows 95
is actually live streamed via satellite
video uh but now people like how
satellite video what like let's be like
alternatives to the internet also
alternatives to the GPS because you know
can be a hacked or spoofed or anything
of that nature here we have something
like this from tone and that's actually
what I've been interested in like how do
this hard to have alternative to GPS all
right uh so tone AI doesn't use
triangulation no satellites no Wi-fi no
nothing everything works offline they
figure out where they are as they drive
it makes sense they use cameras
uh they uh
so so this is talking about the seed
funding Etc uh they connected his phone
to his computer so he pulls in and it
uses his 2019 Honda Civic unmodified it
pulls in data from the Census and it can
be integrated directly into vehicles
from 2009 and
up and it has a cast map of where it is
and it figures out where exactly it is
like it has map that's already been
premade of course and then using censers
it figures out where it is that is so
smart if we can get this integrated into
devices that that would be so much
better and look at this Innovation it's
coming here it only took 10 minutes for
it to figure it out from a cold start
and if you have your direct position
known already you can have like GPS
without having to have Reliance on
satellites but having like have those
little paper scrolly maps that they used
to have in the 30s this is so
interesting and so intriguing and it's
great to see some actual Innovation
being used oh let's connect to S oh
let's connect to the
cloud uh yeah so uh as as you guys know
I like reading high school newspapers so
I think it's one of the best ways to
figure out the information about a town
or something we even did a uh we did a
uh a video about like the tech that's
behind the high school newspapers right
and high school newspapers can sometimes
be a more local you can find out about
the school maybe even find out about the
student council so this is from Slate
press uh what school is
this sou Lakes High School okay okay so
this is in like Katie Katie so some guy
from the church talked about it I was
talked about the school I was interested
I researched the school I found their
newspaper student council Instagram
accounts Etc all right so here are some
articles here and they actually did one
called chat is this real and then they
have a 2024 election recap that came out
last week so um isn't that great you
know a recap of an election that
happened the year before November
everyone knows the results and then the
win already got inaugurated two months
uh before before you vot the article
definitely the time to release release
an article like that oh no I will say
that you know in then like the tapa
twins book where the president has like
two terms um from September to January
then January to the end of the school
year where you have to be like re run
again for re-election it kind of makes
sense like why will you have to run
again for re-election in the month of
January what have you done yet like
from September to January half of that
is gone like we did this in December
half of your month is gone your people
gonna be gone for a fourth of the month
in November You're Not Really Gonna Know
many people when you get inaugurated in
September and not be able to do much so
like you have to put out something and
um the only thing you can put out is
like homecoming I don't know as the
Middle School thing in like October so
you know like if you if you don't put
that out you have nothing and you're
gonna get crushed in your re-election
bid and then that person they only gonna
have nothing to do because you know
they've only been in the office for like
three months it's like so maybe that's
what happened to the newspaper like okay
we have all this stuff to cover we only
have like a few months I'm not even
going to be here so yeah I don't even
know why the tapa twins has a a
re-election in January like could you
imagine like your high school president
has been in the office a few months and
like down down with this person down
with down with Allison like could you
imagine like just like did that of
course now there was this thing about
how she might leave the school so there
might be no lot reelection but that's
different right anyway back back to the
article here humu
me chat is this real what the sigma is
this article about um it's actually
column writing it's the kind of humor
you see nowadays and actually this
person touches on a useful Point uh Jing
Define so uh go follow him I don't I
don't know him I didn't go to school
I've actually never seen where these
references originated from exactly like
what where do these people come up these
stupid wo chat is this real what the
sigma is this um where do you people get
this anyway uh specifically high schools
are connected virtually and they're
connected to the WID sprain chain of
reaction uh of trendiness
and uh he likes
this and you
know like he's talking about where humor
comes from but I really want to touch on
this point here as well like where did
these refes come from where did these
people get this like well like this is
the kind of Journalism I like to see
from a school newspaper now the election
article is just stupid but we'll get
into that one as well also this is from
uh s Lakes High School which is in KD
which just went full communist
they're like oh guys we're going to ban
cell phones we're going to ban you from
piing your own personal laptop I think
we talked about this when it actually
came out back in 2024 but everyone is
gonna have their own
Chromebook and now people are not going
to know who can and can't afford a
laptop ohuh they're still gonna know
they're still gonna know also you know
giving everyone the same trash laptop
instead of letting giving them a trash
laptop and if they don't want to use
that trash laptop letting them use you
know an actual laptop
it's good like now if you're giving them
all like gaming computers or something
that's fine but
like you just kind of like made the
people who have the access to technology
that would be a lot better for learning
because you know the browser not going
to load five minutes and going to crash
on you a lot harder and also they just
did this so that they can kind of
unequivocally Bann like cell phones
which is just again
stupid it's just like you don't need to
go communist on this like like like you
know you know you know for well that
iPhone is uh a lot better than that
Chromebook and you know I how I hate to
uh compliment Apple like I compliment
Tik Tok and apple in the same
day anyway now let's get to a s Lakes
High School and this is also an SN uh by
the way for the 2024 election recap
which was uh it was an article oh yeah
anyway the 2024 election was one of the
most prominent conversations throughout
the American society in recent times
understand so blah blah blah
controversial figure Donald Trump versus
former VP K Harris the former Democratic
demm is that how they do it isn't it
just B and then just
R also um we forgot a space there but
whatever yada yada yada of course
talking about you know once again the
the
recap and
uh this is hilarious I was very hopeful
that the candidates would speak about
increasing humanitarian Aid to play
across the world there in desperate need
of it but to displacement of conflict in
regions if America want to be the
greatest democracy in the world
theological extension of that would be
to protect the right of
everyone that's uh you know look I'm not
against it but uh that that is a
sentence of um saying that you know we
should just like be a charity that's
essentially what this person just said
in the school news article that's yeah
that's hilarious it this I believe that
equal access to basic Healthcare rights
of pount in no to be the
Deni basically healthcare services that
were considered medically safe and
available throughout the world I how do
the people who run this newspaper let
this run like BR imagine if I the
president of this school and I'm like in
like 2022 the Press would have just like
killed me the Press would have been like
what is wrong with this kid the pr the
Press would have been like you want to
do what I'm like well I mean I you
forced me into saying this
but
e
e e
yeah yeah so these people be like what
you want to be what you're gonna you're
gonna do what you're against this you're
against that like uh from the
20202 election they probably would just
like kicked me off the ballot anyway uh
blah blah blah this issues regarding
civil rights and lgbtqia plus especially
and race a minorities s to me in this
election who are these
reporters imagine imagine writing a
recap in election that like 2% of the
school could vote in and then just
saying things like like 1% of people
care about in a student newspaper six
months late and and get that fun imagine
if I ran like a GNN episode about the H
like the the
2012 election or something like that
like that's that's called a documentary
at this point uh I believe candidates to
be protecting the rights of everyone in
the United States rather than not align
with cultural delion so like just just
ridiculous uh the issue of palite is
very important to him I okay well I hope
the Advent Adventure Bay and the issues
of nania were also important to this
person as well as they do take most uh
significance over that you know in the
fictional country thing here as well
blah blah blah genocide genocide blah
blah blah
like how was this an article
it's just
just who wrote this don't bully anyone I
I didn't tell you do that but
like the Press over there is
just just just just something else this
is this is this is what happens when I'm
researching people I just
yeah all right let's talk about Sesame
AI from ZDNet uh Sesame AI is apparently
like
a thing that's going on here and it's a
virtual assistant that has a really good
voice
so maybe we should get on a singing show
or something that might that might be
good you know here oh here we go talking
talking sesame's AI voice companion
let's see what Sesame AI can
do yeah let's do a let's do a live demo
I pul it pull it up in the tab but
apparently Sesame AI is able to change
its accent to American accent um she
said that it it was this guy's friend
which
is that's nice uh I mean it's better
than you know you know some people need
friends I need friends uh she wanted uh
controversial takes you know uh so you
know they really liked it but it's not
patient so I I actually kind of think
that's good because
uh I on a because I cannot spell Sesame
apparently uh sesame I voice companion
I'm going to try it out in in another
tab but you guys get to look at this
nice
looking headline so it's a win-win for
both of
us all right so I pulled up the Sesame
AI tab you know to today's run show is a
lot better than last week's run show we
get to talk about you know stupid
student newspapers we get to talk about
uh this article Evangelical from SS ltw
where we just like I I'm like we're not
going to appoint felons to the student
council we didn't even appoint someone
to student council so we probably could
have pished for assign at being the
student council you
know it's kind of interesting because
like if SSA was a bit more summarised
like Advanced for more proo policies it
probably still would have ended the same
way because like you know I wasn't like
all that in on you know summer like she
didn't really do much but like you know
lcw the series it's like after January
7th we just went all somewhere in like
everything is like link ins TI to which
is true but like I we po cam so you know
Pro summer you know I'm still Pro summer
to this day like in real life we would
be friends if we ever you know sorry
each other but we don't but we still are
friends hopefully you know in the 10%
chance that she's listening to this
podcast instead of like doing anything
else like anything useful in in life

I'm yapping about know AI chat bot while
uh you know talking about the benefits
of summis Circa January
2024 and how I wasn't going call thieves
to student council you know did like it
takes a very special type of person to
listen to this podcast a very special
board person uh to listen to this
podcast like uh yeah anyway some some no
Sesame sorry not Sesame uh it's taking
some uh time to to load so you know why
I'm just
yapping that's why I'm just yapping uh

say I mean it doesn't mean it's always
good just it's

as a
compliment well see look this is what
happen we have these low IQ lizard
running around you know chapping trying
to become chat
BS whoa there low IQ lizard that's a
little harsh yeah kind of to the lizard
yeah I'm really sorry that Liz from Kids
Corner he's not well I mean all the
lizards in kid cor were kind of dumb
like there was this episode where they
kind of like he said he was pople and
all these people like I'm going to buy
this medicine from this random person
like what is wrong with you of course
how why would you buy medicine from some
random person just because some random
producer got on stage got back behind
backstage and said that he turned purple
I mean it's absolutely ridiculous sorry
for this side tangent here but me that
kids going episode we have to do a full
review on this lizards huh sounds like
you've got some strong feelings about
those guys and you guys look notice this
is what I call deflection you know how
she's over here yapping about lizard now
instead of yapping about how I called a
low IQ lizard oh look uh Kate says Tech
yeah so look this is what we call
deflection and this is what this is B
essentially what happened to some
someone ask me a question like how to
deflect back back off of them because
I'm smarter than this thing here all
right
yeah you know maybe we could talk about
something else like do you like music no
I'm I'm sorry I'm just trying to find
something we can connect on well I mean
your name is Sesame you know Sesame
Street sesame seeds you know you can put
seeds in the ground put them in you grow
trees trees you know can grow apples
apples you know technology boom that's
one of my games I have over there called
like uh link it or beat it or something
like that uh I invented the game where
you kind of like create uh okay K I'll
ask you I ask that I invented this game
where you kind of like uh link things in
your mind I just that link here where I
connected Sesame to Apple for Apple
phones I should probably published that
game again over the weekend so why did
your X break up with
you that's a pretty clever game what the
stoph that's my game no no no no look
avoiding questions and creating links
between random things is my think you
are going to answer the direct question
I asked you at the end of the think why
did your ex break up with you well there
hold on my ex I'm an AI remember I don't
have exit have exes or boyfriends or any
of that hey uh this this has been fine
but it looks like our time is almost up
oh no it's not we have about no no no no
no answer the question sorry I have to
um you don't what do you have to do you
just sit here and your green glowing dot
you have no
life our time limit is up this call will
end automatically just checking this is
something you experience right you know
a timed connection give me a quick sure
no see in this world we don't have a
concept of time uh one minute x equals 1
hour and 1 hour equals one day so you
know if your actually only been talking
to me for a
second okay well in my world It's Time
to Say Goodbye maybe about your your
world is little
talk to you later
then but she just hung up on me I will
not stand for this we will not stand for
this yeah so that is Maya AI she is very
annoying you know she's kind of like if
we uh uh but
yeah all right so let's see what else we
have on our runner of show for
today nothing
oh Apple released the lossless audio so
uh thank you so you know what lessons
did we learn today before we sign off we
learned that United States should spread
propaganda and China shouldn't and um in
the same week that poon yapped about how
black people apparently run the internet
and social media uh I showed that
actually Tik Tok is a white girl app and
the one black influenc that went vial
other than Ashton Hall who literally
smeared a banana on his face went vial
for trying to Shi for China so you know
kind of bad week for that person here we
also learned that you know if you like
what you do and you want to go after and
get what you get I'll wave you off on
anything even if you do spy on random
people and uh try to date them all right
we learned at the Atlantic thinks that
uh teenagers toned Instagram into a
dating app when it was basically
predestined to be one there there you go
like calvinist points yay uh chrisan
naism uh anyway we learned that
artificial intelligence is uh good oh we
yeah Roblox is releasing an open model
thing there we also learn that I can out
argue Sesame AI any day of the week all
right God bless Tech talk to you later
and remember that uh white people have
contributed immensely to social media oh
also D You Can't Ban me unbannable and
uncan</pre>
