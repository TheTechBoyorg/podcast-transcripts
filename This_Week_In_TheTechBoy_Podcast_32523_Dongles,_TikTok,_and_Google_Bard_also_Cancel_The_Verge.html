<pre>hello this is a YouTube Premiere meaning

I can see you in the chat but I can't

Premiere YouTube premieres are not live
that means I can't see what you're
saying right now and then you're going
to have to wait to ask your questions
when I get into the chat because I'm not
dare okay understand this is a YouTube
premium
hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
all right hello everybody this is the
tech boy and we have a lot to talk about
today today we're going to talk about
um
you know the Verge what we're doing on
that petition there we're going to talk
about Tick Tock a little bit today
there'll be a full video coming up about
um that soon
um I need to start editing the other
video about my secret project that I was
up to about
16 days ago and there's other stuff that
we can talk about that's going on in
Tech Samsung released a new a series
devices and I know you guys are going to
get tired of this but we have uh AI
stuff going on right now so folks let's
get to one of our most interesting
segments the Google baud segment and
that I got access to the list and I'm
just going to be talking to sorry Google
bod
um
so let's let's get to it
um in three two one
all right so I'm about to stay on my
screen with you all I'm going to talk to
Google bod
um
today
there it is it's live you can see it
um
all right here we go Google bard and me
so I was talking to it yesterday because
I got some access to it and
um it was okay it was off actually but
it didn't know quite a lot about me
um but for example I asked it to compare
the iPhone 14 plus and the Samsung
Galaxy s23 plus and
[Music]
um
it
it it didn't go well so let's do that
right now
all right it's all right you're right so
I'm just going to talk about these
phones right now the iPhone 14 plus as
you know
Apple's battery phone
um s23 plus the Samsung's mid but it's a
flag set but it's the the second that's
the middle child yeah it's really good
battery as well so let's see what iPhone
uh oh okay okay let's see what Google
board gives us here it says the iPhone
14 plus and the s3d plus they're both
high-end smartphones are for a lot of
features and here we go iPhone 14 plus
it has 6.7 OLED s20g 6.6 AMOLED display
all right that's right that's right and
we have our first inaccuracy here it
says the Galaxy s23 plus it's powered by
the Snapdragon eight gin one chip it's
not it's 12 by the snapshot with eight
gen two four Galaxy chip which is
helping with it
which is happening with that power
efficiency and battery life that we've
been seeing on the Samsung Galaxy s336
so that's one inaccuracy for the Google
uh
also isn't the iPhone 14 plus powered by
the a15 from last year
I think so so that's not inaccuracy from
Google pod right camera the the iPhone
14 plus is a triple wheel lens camera
system that that that's a lie the iPhone
14 plus has a two lens camera system and
the s20 front system has a quiet lens
camera system that's like also an eye it
has a three triple lens camera system uh
both camera system Max and can take
great photos the iPhone 14 plus has a 47
milliamp battery
I'm pretty sure that's not true
and apple doesn't really disclose that
so I'm going to say that 12 STD plus has
a 5000 milliamp battery again that's not
true that's that's 23 volt so that's a
5000 radar battery idea for 14 plus
starts at 9.99
it starts at 999 it has the price is
wrong but phone's very expensive
and that is wrong that that entire
review if it's wrong about the price if
it's wrong about the batteries it was
wrong about the camera system it was
wrong about the chips it was right about
the display so one out of four for
Google bar
all right all right all right
um but I mean it that's pretty smart I
mean it's still got all the facts wrong
and they have to change the stuff here
but um
let's talk let's see if you know what it
knows about the tech boy
all right all right all right so I have
this image on my phone I gave me the
perfect description so I'm just going to
read this to you then I'm going to be
pulling up the image on my phone all
right all right here we go oh wait no
actually I put it on a website so anyway
it says to check where's the Christian
technology slash product testing blog
and then we'll smooth the read reviews
about technology such as smartphones
laptops and gaming consoles the
broadcast provides information on how to
use technology safely and respond to me
the checkboards went by a teenager named
Kai Kai sanat okay my name's not Kai and
so you can have it redo it again and
while it's generating a response for you
I'm going to go pull up my image
um
of
my posts
um
I had the perfect sponge to what I was
saying what I was asking about what the
tech boy was so just pulling it up I
can't see what's on the screen right now
so please bear with me
um scrolling dude
um and while I'm scrolling through uh
foreign
yeah
um so as I put up the image
um let's get to what it says the tech
was a pseudonym for a teenager who went
to Christian satire site and YouTube
channel that is true but that's not what
I'm known for right now and it's also
known for his humorous time called jokes
and current events and public cultures
also features reviews of the latest guys
I guess was interesting because cc is
not very popular right now but okay
um let's reload again
um
building up my user account to do
I found the image
oh
and it finally cited a source on the
third time here we go attack words of
houston-based tech review and news blog
all right YouTube channel sure yeah
stick to Christians run by teenager Jim
and Drew again this music channel
focuses on tech reviews on us uh safer
acoustic families too much
um website
true yes
um the science tagline is also satire
for the Christian geek
I never wrote that but that is
that's a good tagline I I should use it
um the science content includes articles
videos podcasts Etc is the tech industry
in question culture so if you're
wondering where it's an excited this
from my next door page so if you want to
know what it's talking about uh satire
page I have a site called conservative
contriversity that's what it's talking
about and it's linked to the tech core
media media dot the tech boy dot o r g
it should be flashing across the screen
right now I'm going to have it in
it is it should be
um on the screen right now all right so
hopefully you can see that median at the
techfoy.org all right um and now for the
perfect response to Google board gave to
me yesterday says the tech boy is a
Christian technology slash product
testing blog that enables people to read
reviews about technology products that's
my description for my website it is a
family-friendly website that was found
in 2020 by teenage true the websites
with reviews technology products from
Christmas decorative office I'm
bicycling it on the products Joe and Joe
again the tech Brown for I'm sorry also
offers variety of resources for
Christians or interesting technology
including articles videos and podcasts
true all right that is perfect that is
true that is absolutely correct so
um you know since it's being able to
find out all this information about me
um we're going to be talk going into our
next segment and that's going to be
talking about cancels we're going to be
adding asking sorry askbook what is
cancel the foods
that's Google broad
um lose this on the screen hopefully you
guys can see here you go cancel devotes
cancel the Foods
um
okay which is a technology newspaper
blah blah
blah
um so you didn't exactly get that
oops
I'm asking about the canceled food
petition uh there you go
ah
here he goes let's cancel division
position I started on change.org but I
used to claims to be a former employee
of the vote that's not true I never
claim to look for the food because I
also the subscription
toxic workplace and I started to
uh
um I don't know if that's true
let's get more in-depth and more precise
I actually saw it at you.com speaking of
you.com the AI search engine that we
were talking about yesterday yeah okay
okay there's no position writer 10
quarter cancel the footage oh well
that's absolutely wrong bye Google bard
um sorry that's actually Wrong by Google
Broad and we're going to show you how so
at reports
that's
a report that the tech boy got or we're
going to be showing you people how
um there is a position from us and we're
going to be showing you in three two one
all right here is our report move he's
going to be talking about the other evil
and depravity that's in Tech media right
now in fact I'm going to go off the
camera
it says my audio is removed so I can't
go off the camera
um let's see if I can
no I can't anyway well well we're going
to go in right now the rise are into
biblical agendas in text sites and you
can see this report at reports dot the
techboard dot o r g that's report doctor
Tech boy dot o r g
um one last time for those of you who
may have missed it it's reports Dr Tech
boy dot org
okay
I'm going to be reading the report to
you right now it should be scrolling
across the screen hopefully you can see
that there you go that's the uh URL
um oh here we go the rise of
anti-biblical genders in Texas diverge
Android authority Gizmodo or American
Tech news leak and reviews
um that'd be known by cancer I mean we
don't want these opinions to be shared
on the text sites for that I mean we're
not saying to be just like destroy their
uh the uh the the stuff right anyway so
um
I'm just going to read you a little uh
clips from these segment y'all can read
the few I'm sorry the whole paper here
itself
um The Verge is
uh has great content great content and
well written it's run by a VOX media and
he's trying to get people to commit
crimes
um whether it's illegal or restricted in
the Articles you can see how
highlighting it here
um
there here we go and Android authority
is also promoting on biblical things
that are simple morally
yeah wrong Gizmodo is also doing the
same thing
um especially the footage can go see
that petition on our trains.org
um which the links will be in the
description right here but I just want
to show you guys
um the more depravity that's in these
text sites and why you shouldn't be
supporting them in a disabilities sign
the petitions that I have right now and
I guess as an alert to Google board yes
yes there is a report by detective boy
and the petition by the techboy.org but
now we're going to be talking about
something more exciting more I guess
less less heavy less weighty and we're
going to be I guess it's just kind of
heavy we're going to be talking about
the imminent Tick Tock band that may or
may not be happening right now and what
do I think about that
all right so we're back on techboy.org's
home page site um as you can see we have
our canceled the village petition right
there
um so
what do I think about the tick tock band
and The Tick Tock uh CEO from Singapore
have been questioned by the uh people in
the United States Congress okay
um what I have to say about that is
it's very complex as you can see in my
video that I
um I have on my channel where I sang
what I'm saying um uh and I promise
we'll get to Google buy it back soon
it's just gonna be a short segment
um
that
it's they weren't tick-tocking to be
sold to uh it's U.S sales uh
for it to be banned in the United States
so really Arguments for to be banned
here the arguments for Speed not me so
I'm going to be banned National Security
risk is a threat to kids it's annoying
IQs it's a waste of time Arguments for
it too
um not be banned that's people who have
businesses and livelihoods are there any
people to ban them completely
um
I mean you'd be taking radio I mean to
protects production they'd have to go
migrate somewhere else to do like
Instagram reels or stories or whatever
Instagram does I have YouTube shorts or
something like that
um so
I wouldn't
mind the band but I know to be
uh put out to be I'm just a scientific
150 million Americans the numbers
probably about a little bit lower
because some people probably have more
than one account let's just say 140 145
million Americans use tick tock I have
active accounts which means about half
40 whatever the country uses it
um meaning that'd be outrage and
probably protests and
I mean I'm saying a band would be nice
if you could get first of all it would
probably boost U.S economy because then
you'd have more traffic coming towards
YouTube It's YouTube servers and stuff
um
which would be better than sending it to
the Chinese company
um
but
it
I don't know there's so many people
under who who are making money I think
that we should give people every word to
ban it I mean 30 to 90 day period to
migrate their businesses elsewhere
because if you have 60 million Tick Tock
photos I have so many photos you have
one that's not going to be hard for you
to go onto YouTube and start making
Sports content and to just have your
last videos be uh this is me I'm
migrating over here whatever
um
also tick tock's not that essential it's
not
it would be different than banning
YouTube like there's so many people on
there and it was also just be a band for
the United States so
also I don't know how uh there's so many
people on YouTube there's visual
businesses some of the big biggest
brands and companies and condensation
insights
um I would rather have the data here and
U.S service than overseas on Chinese
symbols right
um
especially since we're not allies with
them like say EU or Great Britain other
countries like that
um anyway
um
another thing would be that tick tock's
not that
useful of a service like Google or
whatever we already went through that
but
um
if if we were to do a band like this on
tick tock
I would think that
first of all we should get uh some type
of waiting period and second of all I
don't know how a band like that would
work on iPhone for example the d-list
app from the apps or whatever who I
guess
there's a website but I don't know if
you could like there'd be so many ways
to circumvent the pain first of all
Android because I looked at the app on
the phone
um
and you can see how well there's a
geography
it's Android you can get past that
um iOS I'm pretty doesn't Tick Tock have
a website I'm going to get best at
um
I don't know how you would effectively
add it like
okay you just force Google Play to do it
and you just go download it from apkpure
or as the uh
87 s percent of GMC kids have iPhones
um in the United States meaning if it's
banned If people could use it but if it
would be a it's all for Android or B A
it just kind of dead-ish kids protesting
whatever ish
discounting the danger of tick tock I
think it's it's a very I mean it's a
very effective one of the most effective
viruses and spy apps that's ever been
made I'm in half of America to Avid from
a foreign country that's hostile to us
I'm saying yeah that's it's very It's
very effective but I mean the kids in
China are getting something different
that's educational let's drop into IQ
points and yeah
a band would be nice I'm not saying if
saying it's feasible is what I'm saying
so you guys can tell me what your
thoughts are on this
um and that's all we have now about Tick
Tock let's now talk about something else
all right
um
so I have to go back to tick off The
Tick Tock conversation we're going to go
back oh
um
[Music]
oh here we go here we go I was talking
about uh
[Music]
all right so
I've realized that people some people
need oh oh I need I know what I need to
do I know all right all right this is
for you person who asked me about
dongles
um someone also asked me about Office
365 so that was for them so I'm writing
articles for people excited so
um
right people who ask me about dunkles
here is your full list and breakdown
nice to have one around here right now
all right here we go all right there are
different types of dongles in
in use okay so do you have your typical
you have a 3.5 millimeter uh to USBC
headphone dongle okay so I'm going to
actually go to Amazon
um so I can show off what these dongles
look like
um but as you wait here's a VGA to HDMI
dongle so I'm just going to go over a
basic
basic classes of dongles
um for you um hopefully you enjoyed this
I might clip it yeah
so as you know modern phones have
largely left the
headphone jack in the past all right
there's no head from Jack on this phone
the Samsung Galaxy
s22 plus
um
all right the Samsung Galaxy s20 plus as
we know use a USBC Port an iPhone has a
lightning port for the time being they
might switch anyway
um so this is one of the most basic
class of dongles here we have a
lightning dongle that uh is for iPhone
users so lightning to usb-c you plug
this into your charging port of your
iPhone or iPad and then you plug in
regular headphones like these that I
have wire nut cables into the hole right
there and then you're playing your music
and you can hear music goes up and it
works the same for USBC you just have to
make sure if it says lightning it's for
iPhone USBC it's for Android I just
understand that all right
um here's a USB c1c you had a porch
different like that like that now
obviously this is an endorsement of
companies this is just showing off what
you like doing to USBC cables um sorry
uh don't go stuck on it now there's
another step up from this dongle I'm
just going there's a all right so USB a
hopefully you guys understand that usba
is regular modern USB port and then USBC
is words you have on your uh
uh on your on your phone unless you have
an iPhone there's lightning so there's
uh USBC to
the USB a Samsung just include these
with their phones for power transfer or
whatever here's another type of dongle
right here and you have USBC Cedar Port
there to uh oh sorry guys uh yeah there
you go USBC to USB so this will work on
a mod network phone or an iPad a modern
iPad that has USB C ports if you want
one for lightning this one for lightning
as well which means it's for iPhone
talks if you understand I'm trying I'm
not trying to make this as complicated
as possible and then there's another
class app from dongle which is usually
for laptops but will work with Android
phones I'm not sure about iPhones um and
they're like USBC
USBC just dunkles um
I use this for my phone you know you can
plug it into a monitor for external
effects
um but here we go so USBC so Android and
MacBooks and iPads now this is not
endorsement of the companies obviously
but as you can see
um you plug this into your phone uh like
so and
you have HDMI USBC for charging the
phone and the USB and USB game MicroSD
SD card slots all right you plug that
into your phone or your laptop is most
likely a laptop if you have a newer
MacBook you won't have so many sports
um
most notably the usb-a but and um it
will
allow your phone to access those files
so those are basically three different
types of dongles now that you have more
nice amount of dongles let's say you
have a older monitor like this one here
you can see it
um
good
um all the monitor like the one I just
showed you and you only have a
a VGA
in there because you only have HDMI
because your laptop's like new and that
from 10 years ago so you use one of
these like so it has the audio
HDMI input and power my videos
so hopefully you have an understanding
of toggles
um if you have any questions about what
kind of Dunkle used to get you can ask
me have a dongle review on my website
the tech boy dot o r g that is the tech
boy.org now the don't worry but not no I
would not recommend it
um at all
anyway
um
so yeah those are the different types of
dongles hopefully you understand and I I
explained it to the best of my abilities
um
and then of course different UI and I O
that you can use not making sense for
that all right well learn about that
subject
one last thing so as you can see I'm
responding requirements and answering
people's users questions so hopefully
you enjoyed this hopefully you enjoyed
this premium and if you have any
questions
um ask about that I'm doing a little
mini series about Samsung
devices so we have the importing images
on Samsung devices
um how to record Bluetooth stuff from
Samsung devices image editing Wi-Fi
tracking piano piano I think I
misspelled that
um on Samsung devices so
anyway
um hopefully you enjoyed this hope you
enjoy the techboy.org and oh no I think
I can't forget about the Google broad
segment I promised again so let's make
this extra quick I'm just going to go to
the
website
um I'm just gonna ask you one more
question uh let's make it a good one
let's make it a good one
um
oh it does do code let's do code
um I'm gonna ask it a question I know it
got right
um
I'm asking you what is the largest
freestanding temper flame building oh I
misspelled a little bit let's see if I
can get it do I just freestanding timber
frame
in the world what uh
it's it's
in the US
um
maybe it's not freestanding
see
it's a good one something in Norway
uh some building in North I don't see
Ark
some feeling of Wisconsin anyway all
right interesting I'm just gonna present
to the screen so you can see the answers
in there and I'm going to spice this in
somewhere okay
uh bye for now and we'll see more from
Bart later bye till now Tech talk to you
later God bless
and goodbye
good night and God bless
