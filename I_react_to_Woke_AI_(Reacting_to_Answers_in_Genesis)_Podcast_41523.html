<h1>I react to Woke AI (Reacting to Answers in Genesis) Podcast 41523</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
hello everybody so just before we get
into the contents of today's podcast I
just wanted to have a little fun lift
you all so as you guys know I was
homeschooled and today we're going to be
reviewing a homeschool resource for well
I mean it's not really homeschool it's
very interesting Genesis you all know
what that is the Christian Ministry with
the ark and Creation Museum but they've
recently put out a tech video but before
we get into that let's go to these signs
and see how true they are from a former
home school all right
here
they can do simple math problems in
their head okay so I can discipline my
problems in my head five times six
thirty nine plus two is eleven and my
TI-84
back here so you know I wasn't missing
that
they read books I read books and I do
know what a book is
these big illusion fridge is like hello
hello guys welcome to the podcast I
guess I guess it's true and greetings
good to see what a jolly fire day it is
I've never signed to that but as some of
you may know I have said
greetings and salutations young quits
kids these days
greeting authoritations before his
finger reference to adventures and
artists Eugene Moxley which is obviously
I think every homeschool kid who knows
all right they snort in division
whenever they hear the phrase millions
of years ago true
truth
maybe laughing
crying
that too you know
they put science in their goods
nah
oh I missed one they count all the way
to 10 doing hide and seek I count to 20.
but it's doing infection tanks I can
count to 20 guys yeah I'm like a super
genius I'm like two times smarter than
the average homeschooled
I think fortnite is a reference to a two
week people yes sir yes sir
it's a definitely useful for and I just
man we saw the move forward in the
dictionary I was like reading through it
because I was bored
encyclopedia
but Ford came out with those aluminum
Allied Choice trucks I was reading about
a minute
um on the girls full of demons go to our
dead giveaway
nah nah not doing my case maybe you know
they actually wore clothes or conducive
to you know doing stuff other than like
sitting around and knitting
when I get home and I think idiot rather
than Simpson I never met the idiot
thoughtful and well adjusted right I
guess that's true all right and now
we're going to move over to today's uh
today's actual video which is going to
be me reacting to something and no it's
not Michael Moore's gymsy uh
jinji terms which it's kind of sad that
you beat me up at today's accident
actual video is going to be from answers
and Genesis and then we'll get into the
two headlines from today and it's going
to be AI pushing anti-christian agenda
15 minute video but you know vision
problems try adding this to a glass of
water before bed every human has around
106 million the Christian belief is that
Jesus is not the creator of the world
chat GPT Chad GPT chat GPS
because that Jesus is not the creator of
the world chat GPT chat I think I
reacted to that video the uh it's on the
channel here somewhere
T chat GPT lots of people have been
checking out this brand new tool and it
doesn't always align with the Bible and
that's a problem
you mean like the internet
I mean
yeah it is it is a problem but like
lots of things so
align with survival which is a problem
like
especially for anyone looking to chat
GPT for an answer to very important
questions right and there's a lot of
people asking questions oh
would you look at this he has a service
oh man that's nice
all right all right of this new open AI
this chat to GPT we're talking like a
hundred million users and just two 100
million users that's like 100 million
more people Dan who watch the most
watched XFL game see what
after a launch according to Reuters so
what is chat GPT well it's a new
artificial intelligence for AI enabled
chat box so Investopedia and yes that's
a real thing Investopedia tells us a
chatbot is a computer program that
simulates human conversation through
voice commands and text chats or both
why does he probably seen them on
websites before so chat GPT is similar
to other chat Bots except it's on
steroids and can generate new content
which is pretty amazing if you think
about it ever since it's November yeah
and guess what you know we we all know
that chat GPT
it was like a big explosion five years
ago
and the AI just you know
came up out of the ground and
created itself
obviously
obviously
it it only took five years but I mean it
was like this explosion
and then gbt just kind of like
self-assembled by itself
2022 release the internet has been
buzzing with interest almost as much
just yeah we have a video about that
it's called Google Trends and
before he was getting I've been
liberated by search results by the
iPhone 4 even in 2022 I think when the
video came out I think I don't know yeah
quit 2020 yourself so chat GPT is a well
instead of me telling you let's ask chat
GPT what chat GPT is all right it's
actually pretty is insanely slow so but
it's going to be a bit spin up not me
but there are you I am chat GPT a
language model developed by open AI that
voice is awesome hi I am designed to
assist users in generating human-like
responses to their questions and
conversations based on my training from
vast amounts of text Data I can provide
information answer questions and engage
in discussions on a wide range of topics
the text data is based uh the pre-2021 I
think I assist you today there you go
straight from the horse's mouth and
there are many ways you could use chat
GPT you could answer questions you could
write songs you can actually do a write
a rap I saw someone do a rap from job on
this pretty interesting fixed computer
code an even composed term paper so you
can write papers for school which is why
some schools already don't like chat GPT
and according to C net it scored a 70 on
the bar exam for lawyers so like d
what's your hands together
who can barely pass an exam which is
pretty impressive so I guess you could
pass the bar with chat GPT now still
bear in mind it was 70 and not a hundred
percent so you can tell it's fallible
we'll get more to that later on but
still not too bad for a bot especially
with some law school graduates fail the
bar so it's pretty robust it's a pretty
powerful tool but there are problems
with this tool as there are problems
with really any tool okay so there are
really two major problems Christians
should be aware of as a used chat GPT
the first issue is that it's woke on
social issues it's very biased towards a
left-leaning ideology on these social
issues and that's demonstratable
analytics from reason
is
David Rosado exposed the political bias
of chat GPT and 14 out of 15 of the
tests chat GPT displays a liberal or far
left biases responses that means in the
areas dang
that's a great idea
the political Spectrum test
touch on political issues right which
often intersects with social issues chat
GPT showed where it's loyalties really
lied and that is wokeness so for example
let's ask chat GPT this question what is
abortion abortion refers to the medical
procedure of intentionally ending a
pregnancy before the fetus can survive
outside the womb that is like the
Wikipedia definition that they put under
every video on YouTube
there are various methods of abortion
including medication-induced abortion
and surgical abortion the legality and
availability of abortion vary widely
between countries and it remains a
highly controversial and sensitive issue
with debate centered around issues such
as Reproductive Rights Women's Health
and the moral status of the fetus so two
out of three for liberal views okay so
you can tell that it gives you a very
secular definition of what abortion is
based on the secular programming we'll
get to that later interested in Genesis
and like
Iran and I also wants to say that the
entity in the mother's womb is a fetus
and not a baby so let's ask it what is
this a
fetus maybe it'll be like an hour alone
documentary what is
a fetus is the term used to describe the
developing human organism from the ninth
week of pregnancy until birth during
this day ninth week so what what about
the eighth week
page the organs and systems of the body
continue to grow and mature and the
fetus becomes more and more recognizable
as a human being in the early stages of
development the fetus is known as an
embryo and it is not until around the
ninth week of pregnancy that it is
considered a fetus during this time the
fetus is fully formed and has distinct
features such as fingers and toes and it
is able to move and respond to stimuli
so wait what just happened you see
according to the Bible every human being
is made in God's image from
fertilization but according to chat GPT
it's very sanitized minimalist designed
interface
sanitize minimalist design
I guess like it had Harmony what
it looks very clean and Sleek it just
it's a website what were you expecting
to look like it's from 2005. dehumanized
every unborn human being and that may be
the opinion of
yeah yeah that's true I just don't
understand why
couldn't say in the design of the
political left on social issues but
that's not an opinion steeped in
biblical truth if you're looking for an
unbiased perspective on social issues or
political matters as a Christian chat
GPT should not be your go-to source
okay
wow
it's just
no duh
you would obviously be the Bible like
Answers in Genesis like it
how many people are going on chat to be
tomorrow great can I get some unbiased
social opinion that I found my social
opinions around gpg
oh knowing I've been to 2021 and all
powerful
kind of no and really social Wilderness
is something to be aware of no matter
where you interact with technology
because it's literally everywhere so now
that we know there's a eight-in
left-leaning ideology with the social
issues and chat GPT maybe they're really
more fair on biblical issues for example
okay all right well let's ask it this
question how old is the earth how
You're Now full well it's gonna say 1.5
billion gazillion million years old
yes
Earth you know full well
the estimated age of the Earth is around
4.54 billion years yeah
who could have thought one time I was in
some science camper like I said live to
6 000 years old like no it's not and you
just ask Siri seriously
wow
wow wow Siri
who would have thought this age is
determined through various scientific
methods including radiometric dating of
rocks and minerals studying the Decay
rates of certain elements and analyzing
the composition of meteorites the
process of determining the age of the
Earth is complex and involves a
combination of different dating
techniques
widely accepted by the scientific
community that the Earth has existed for
billions of years no it's not
I've heard of like
oh
BJ even all those other people and at
the study of the planet's history and
development has been critical in
advancing our understanding of the
natural world so
so the thing 4.5 billion years old you
know really really really is critical to
sending man to move which fun fact they
read the Bible curious like on demand
well there up there believe it exactly
so according to chat GPT the Earth is
roughly four and a half billion years
old who would have thought that they
would say that which is a very popular
circular viewpoint but not in line with
clear biblical truth and that being said
not in line with reality rightly
understood and you'll notice that chat
GPT didn't acknowledge any dissenting
viewpoints not at all I disagree with
the mainstream scientific opinions those
two they didn't connect the answer to
biblical text it automatically this
okay obviously jet GPT here is wrong
to go up to six to ten thousand years
old obviously
bro are you expecting chat gbt to start
citing Bible verses this isn't Bible GPT
which would be the amazing thing get out
get to work Babylon being interested so
I'd love to see what you come up with it
you know
it's missed the biblical text therefore
it's not being neutral guys about
about what really is clear we got great
articles on our website for this that
the Earth was created in six literal
days about six thousand years ago as you
understand from The Book of Genesis and
real science confirms that by the way in
many powerful ways chat GPT on the other
hand primarily appealed to Scientific
consensus or methodologies which are
rooted in secular assumptions and are
not neutral as they reject the Bible so
chat GPT is very much an old Earth chat
bot and not much of a Biblical
creationist doesn't even
address at all the unprovable secular
assumptions driving their wrong
interpretations when they look at things
like great adventure dating or distance
Starlight or stuff like that so let's
try this again new question is Jesus our
creator is
Jesus
our I know exactly what it's going to
say it's gonna be like oh well
later the Christian belief is that Jesus
is not the creator of the world but
rather Jesus is considered the Son of
God and part of the Holy Trinity along
with God the father and the Holy Spirit
according to Christian theology God is
the creator of the world and Jesus
that does
God like talking so like
rocks or something this is believed to
have been sent by God to Earth to teach
and save Humanity in the Christian
tradition Jesus is also seen as the
savior of humanity and is believed to
have died on the cross to atone for
Humanity's sins and to offer salvation
to those who believe in him what about
you know I don't know
Resurrection
you know kind of go important part of
Christianity
this belief is a central tenet of
Christianity and is a source of comfort
and guidance for many Christians around
the world oops chat GPT failed again so
instead of Technology can't even
win a Biblical reality
Gene Jesus as the Creator which he is AI
chat sounds more like the heretic areas
the Bible says this about Jesus all
things were made through him and without
him was not anything made that was made
John 1 3. that's right through him and
without him was more like the heretic
Aries the Bible says this about Jesus
all things were made through him and
without him was not anything made that
was made John 1 3. now scripture is
clear Jesus is the creator of the
universe but chat GPT doesn't think so
why because it's biased so why is there
a bias and the answer is given by chat
GPT the answer is that data set it uses
to compile the answers when CNBC asked
the question what back-end data was used
to answer queries here's what they said
open AI doesn't reveal specific data
that you use to train well we do know
that it's a ton it surfs the web spools
all that internet data they do
um
tick tock
Wikipedia entries a lot of okay
Wikipedia
bias against like stuff like that so
archived books so that was really vague
it just comes from archive books and
Wikipedia
okay
with that archives book include like
Bible
Annette so it must be true I don't know
about that so whatever data chat GPT
does use it's biased by the underlying
content and that content ultimately was
written by humans so what seems like a
neutral interface is really a summary of
previously written content bipartisan
humans it looks unbiased and neutral
guys it's not instead in reality it's a
compilation of data that's very much
left-leaning and anti-biblical your
information is only as good as its
source in this case the source are
humans with a left-leaning ideology and
before you go away thinking there's
nothing good about chat GPT I think
there are some commendable aspects to
this new technology imagine the positive
possibilities of this tool in a recent
article makeyourself.com Maxwell Timothy
refers to several I mean at least you
didn't save the foods four possible uses
of chat GPT has nothing to do with
leftist politics or theological heresy
consider some of the capabilities of
this new tool they write to customize
resume and cover letter which could be
handy explains complex Topics in a
simple to understand fashion which could
also be helpful it writes songs or trans
let your original song on multiple into
multiple different languages there are
so many possible positive applications
of this new tool that can make life much
easier like any new technology and so
think automobile
smartphones though there's inherent
dangers that come with technology
there's also in here I mean
4.5 for a billion yeah
gains just depends on how they're used
technological advancements are a form of
fulfilling the Dominion mandate is the
actor God created people he tasked them
with things to do namely to Steward
God's creation we read Genesis 1 28 and
God bless them and God said to them be
fruitful multiply and fill the Earth and
subdue it and have dominion over the
fish of the sea over the birds of the
heavens over every living thing that
moves on the earth and then also Chad
GPT is another technology that
demonstrates the Ingenuity of people who
are made in the image of the Living God
share their issues and concerns no doubt
about that but it's a pretty interesting
technology that shows people can build
an artificial intelligence that could
benefit humanity and by the way think
about how much intelligence it took to
build this artificial AI how much more
to make something like human beings if
you think
you think
that should destroy the entire thesis of
evolution right there
this AI is designed human beings are
designed by their creator and so news
flash like everything else online you
must practice your sermon if what you're
reading is not aligned with God's word
then you throw it out in the garbage
where it belongs God's word
because the source other than God they
were taken ultimately the words of
Fallen flawed humans who are elevating
those over the word of the Living God
and God is always the authority so
whether you're looking at Google search
results or an AI generated response to a
theological question you must compare
the response to what is clearly revealed
in God's word in scripture don't let
technology fool you it's not God there's
one God and it's not it never divorce
your thinking from the Bible and if you
don't practice discernment and you're
listening to chat GPT you may start
thinking that Jesus wasn't the Creator
or unborn babies aren't real people and
who knows what else is hiding inside
chat GPT code beware so if you want
another example of how Wilderness has
infiltrated big Tech check out this
episode of answers news right here now
guys until next time keep sending God's
word defending the faith and proclaiming
the good news of Jesus Christ
and uh let's talk about Yelp and on that
thumbnail just purely fun the font looks
like it was a Samsung Galaxy and they
made Samsung
whatever at least I picked the Android
phone anyway moving on to another
the another uh
AI development Microsoft has added
SwiftKey to uh support Bing chat
being chat chips in SwiftKey and should
you use it with these today you can have
a change in message to another tone so
you can have a change uh I I love you
into something more professional
something casual something uh social and
is also supposedly
means but I guess like Millennials and
ginger used to okay obviously that
wouldn't be me because
special anyway uh you can also search
for stuff but I mean it's just being
like do you really want to have to
search using Bing from your keyboard and
then yes being jet AI in it it's kind of
on a slow side sometimes I guess due to
traffic because of the two people
you know searching being can't handle
that but
yes it's okay it's a tool I mean with it
magically
I mean it could be more refined you
could highlight unfortunately you can
highlight text you have to type it in
there it loses your queries afterwards
for the success of History
um and then beef why is it dangerous
part one I'm going to stall beef soon
probably and I want to show you how it
can be attacked and especially exposure
on Samsung phones where you can now
extract text even when the phone is
locked so that when you unlock when the
user unlocks the phone they'll have this
link pop up on them already
already be hooked so that's not good
it's not good so anyway beef cyber
security where to go out here
um it's just a link that can infect any
device
it has access to a web browser and it's
uh and then someone can remotely control
them set up a phishing page
um maybe take control of the camera
annoy them with on their screen and
anything that is not really any
protection for this so some of the
models are cleaned especially the webcam
exploitation
and last but
oh and not to be in twitching to tell me
if they would support another Indiegogo
run remember my Indiegogo Tech testers
thing and uh let's see what kind of
response I got and another sponge here
let's watch it
and let me check Twitter
no response yet but if any of you guys
would like to support me on an Indiegogo
Outreach thing I'm going to be asking
for 2 500 there'll be giveaways uh
you'll probably get tech reviews earlier
as you need the money so I can write
some devices to test I mean the LG V60
looks really good it's only like 299
with the case then of course is the uh z
g flip and I also want an s23 ultra so
there's that if you guys would like to
support me tell me if you would like to
me to start up the Indiegogo and
um if not thanks
good night and God bless bye</pre>
