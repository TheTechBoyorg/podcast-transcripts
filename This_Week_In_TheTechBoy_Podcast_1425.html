<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 1425</h1>
<pre>everybody and welcome to this weekend to
techboy podcast and happy New Year we
have so much to get into today make sure
that the microphones are working the
camera's on
and let's uh take a
pause pause there's no pause
anyway Hello everybody welcome back to
the tech this weekend the tech boy
podcast today we have a very very
important topic to talk about
today to talk about today
um
all anyway guys we're back there was
some type of uh glitch or issue anyway
um let's redo this anyway Hello
everybody welcome to this weekend the
tech boy podcast so much has happened
today and happy New Year but there's one
thing that we need to dive into first
and foremost before we get into anything
else before we get into the tech boy.org
before we get into SS ltw which we got a
whole new redesign we have to talk about
Isabella Maria Dela absolutely nuking I
mean nuking
destroying um HP Davis's um like literal
entire career I mean it is over it it is
over she is done she is cooked it it
take her out take her behind the
Woodshed it's done it's done it's burnt
to a crisp so
for some dumb reason Pearl Davis thought
it would be a great idea to go on and
fight against and I kid you not uh Josie
from the redhead libertarian is mar and
Courtney all in the same thread and you
will all see them here and they um they
she it's over in fact she got community
noted so she's not getting any revenue
from this here but she tried to create
these quote catfish of the Year Awards
which it seeks to go after woman who
have done the great crime of um
filtering their face and
um one makeup like every woman has come
before them and will after them anyway
so she tries to go after them and as we
always say never we never let a good
gate go to waste so she's blaming people
for face tune but you know what the
number one question is what is face tune
because it's a tech or website we have
to tell people what face tune is we have
to give them what they want and guess
what we will know article about that but
anyway never let a good gate go to waste
that will be the title of today's
episode anyway back to the thing so see
try to give out these catfish of the
Year Awards and she wants people to go
in and like and Retreat the people who
she thinks would win catfish of the year
now obviously because people are smart
and they're not going to sit to here and
scroll to random woman that um you know
oh wow she will filter and she look
different or she will make up and look
different they're not really going to
care so just going to like and retweet
retweet the retweet the first person
that they see hence the first person won
which then she also n put a community
note here too so here we have uh TRL
which is gonna go with that Josie um
first of all she got her Hong she's 35
okay she posted she was 32 in 2019 this
came out but not 2019 2022 or something
like that anyway she's 35 I think she
was like 30 in 2019 according to a
timestamp and then this came out in 2024
add four to that add five to that
depending on when you look at to see 34
35 something like that I did the age
calculations a few days ago and of
course she did win uh the award because
um she was first but I mean the absolute
ratio on here is is terrible and Sydney
Sweeney she the Samsung you know girl I
don't know why she's on this list anyway
we've gone over this multiple times
obviously she didn't win because she
didn't come back and snap back but she
snapped back I mean she was um she
basically destroyed her with the
screenshot of some old tweet that he had
said um and then deleted it a few few
years ago um but we don't have to get
into that but she destroyed her okay so
this this woman here absolutely
destroyed this other woman here I just
realized they had the same hair color
anyway so she destroyed her right now
was G to screw down then we have some
random golfer no here we have the face
tun thing um then we have to get to the
number one of the ah yes here we
go this absolutely destroyed her okay
first of all I do not know what you
doing like why hey kids hey guys look
look you see in one image this is taken
with a camera and this
one what the did you take this with a a
smartwatch how is this proof of
anything hey guys look you look better
when you have a 12 megapixel camera
instead of a 2 megapixel camera
who would have known that's why we're a
Tech podcast here to bring you the best
news that you look better in a 100 times
100 times better when you have a 100
times more
megapixels man that that that is that is
something you know we we have really
learned something today and oh my
goodness she destroyed her so I mean it
was so much fun it was so much fun um
you know at least I had fun um
you know it it it was it it was
absolutely
ridiculous how bad how badly she got
destroyed by her I mean she got
absolutely ratioed and we have to show
you here on the screen um let see I'm
GNA find my media of all the memes I
made of this so of course you know uh
the Mean Girls movie that that's a here
here we have who yeah here we go let's
see if we can share this on the screen
shift three okay yeah there we go this
is basically who going on
then we also have um let's take this off
the
screen um then we also have her going up
against like X the X version of NATO you
know very very smart of it very very
smart of it and you're going to see the
absolute Smackdown that this was all
right anyway I'm going to find the
smackdown um post so let's go over to
her
profile you go I mean she she destroyed
it
destroyed so see when she's still up
there back you know posting her uh the
Tik toks and stuff like that there is
Media I gotta find the
images of the
ratio
ratio oh yes this I mean this might be
one of the tweets of of of the
decade this is who you guys ask me to be
the biggest F since disne fit in frame
so be for real absolutely oh let me like
that absolutely destroyed her 15 ,000
likes there but that's not the tweet
that destroyed that's not the tweet that
took her out back oh no oh no she she
got destroyed like multiple times you
know I'll let you guys go read this
multiple times on your own because you
know it's fun you know and we're not
going to sit here and still her worthy
Crown we're not going to sit here and
you know have me read them out for you
you guys have eyes you guys can go read
them the off also you know you basically
feeding her and also defeating the other
all right let's
keep let's keep
uh I'm trying to find the oh here it
is dang it let's see if I can search oh
yes yes yes yes there's a search button
here I
mean I mean this this this is a lesson
in in in comebacks this is a lesson
in
uh this is this is a lesson in comebacks
V
comebacks
um oh my
gosh she has so many replies in I should
have bookmarked them let's see if I can
find them it's terrible that we're
trying
to let's see if I can find
[Music]
him I'm I'm going to try to find him we
get back um to this because it is it is
it is a comeback for the century but
right now as we get into that let's
let's talk about what is Phase T So as
you guys know we never let a good gate
go to waste whether it be Kate gate
whether it be bikini gate whether it be
uh what was it calendar gate yeah we got
400 views on article about Samsung
calendar because we just hashtag
calendar gate that see that was fun you
know all the gate it is gate season in
America you know it is gate season in
America so we have to talk about
um what face tune is in face tune you
can't even see this on the screen
terrible podcast anyway what is face
tune well well well this time last year
we did an article on Samsung calendar
now face tune seems to be popular so we
checked out the features and what is it
what can face to do well can do a lot
and like I said promises made Promises
Kept I always try to keep my promises to
you guys I said that with how photo leap
was keeping people from being able to
generate multiple images of people right
of course you know gr is now trash as
you know from the article and the video
right you can now change people's
outfits here in face tune as well so
that is a feature in face tune so if you
have an AI influencer put them in here
put them in here and you can change the
outfits now the sad thing is that I
think we get down into this but um this
is an example of what it can do so this
is a default generated image here then
we edited the hair here you can notice
how the top of the hair is darker and
this is uh whiter down here while this
is more Brown so you can do that you can
do different hairstyles changes um you
can do edits so know you can push in
here push in here whatever this not
edited but I'm saying that is a
potential um I think you can also make
like someone taller like by changing the
perspective you can also add makeup um
much makeup edit
here looks like it yeah I think there's
a makeup edit here so you can also add
makeup um two photos here I'm for the
men you also get different styles of
look so you don't get makeup because
that obviously that makes sense
um
now there are a few issues with this
tool so first of all
the the
um it there is a watermark and that
unfor you so if you want to use it make
sure you crop it out unfortunately the
app wised up and figured out to block
screenshots so you cannot um you can't
you can't just screenshot it you can't
screenshot from any of those photo apps
except for
um except for uh what's one called
motion leap I think which the which is
the animation application I think you
can still screenshot inside of that
application so um yeah also you can find
different outfits or you can have ai
generate your own outfit so let's say
there's a dress in there like some blue
dress or something that you want there
you can pick pick it and it will paint
over well so if it's going dress with
dress it will paint over well but let's
say you want to do say a shirt but some
the person is wearing I don't know
like a dress or something so you want to
do a shirt and cargo shorts or something
like that it will it will mess up it's
gonna kind of like merge the clothing
into like one big object or something so
sometimes it doesn't do the best um it
doesn't do the best and what it can't
what what it should be able to do um at
least in terms of clothing um anyway
that is what face tune is make sure you
guys check that out uh if you want to be
able to edit your photos anyway
searching for songs on your device can
sometimes be hard you know if you have a
song playing on your device then you
know you won't be able
to um know what it is that that was up
until recently up until recently you
know we weren't able to figure out what
songs we playing on our
devices
because of just reasons they didn't have
that Bak into features but if you use
Circle to search on an Android device
you can now figure out what song is
playing on your device and as you can
see on the screen um here is the 2019
BBS theme song um in the wild right and
it's I held on the button I didn't find
the music on the device and for context
that's not immature but it did get it
correct so that is a great thing you can
now identify songs on the device and I
still cannot find her I mean the most
epic comeback of all time here maybe she
deleted not is but um Pearl deleted her
um
her tweet because she got absolutely
beat down she got destroyed she got
nuked okay I mean absolutely nuked okay
um Josie destroyed her community noted
her um basically screenshotted her for
embarrassing things Isabella went after
her oneon-one and destroyed her ratioed
her I mean we had people coming all in
before I mean even with Kate gate and
she wasn't encoun in the gate but bikini
gate was kind of like half and half you
had some sort of a debate going around
the issue right some type oh is she
right is she wrong is she right is she
wrong you know the people fighting in
the comments and you know thing things
of that nature right but here I mean it
is overwhelming majority support um for
her side absolutely getting nuked on on
the other side ratioed I don't really
understand how that works but she is
getting ratioed we're not even seeing
any articles like in the
um you know
NTB uh even yeah NTB did do something on
C gate NTB did kind of do something on
uh the bikini gate um but now nothing
we're not seeing anything no no news
articles I mean it it's like there's
been something of a change here but I
mean it's absolutely 100% overwhelming
Victory even against the odds which were
kind of stacked against it if you think
about it um I think BR has won
1.9 let's see how many followers Paul
has 1.9 million YouTube subscribers and
almost
5,462 point7 followers on X now over
here Isabella
has basically comtable comfortable
amount number of followers um only 742
follow dang we should be 743 anyway
comparable over on X but not as many on
YouTube I don't think just YouTube
anyway
still against the odds actually no it's
not even against odds because if
Isabella has about the same amount as he
has and then he went to war with
Courtney and Josie and then some other
random people oh no she got dog p on it
it was over okay she she was going to
get yeah that was that was bad that was
bad marketing um anyway Let's uh I'm
going to
go anyway welcome back sorry another
Interruption um yeah it was over for
anyway anyway let's do one more thing on
culture and we're going head right back

that came out January 3rd
2025 um um tracking the post them
Fallout so let's get into this let's
talk about gcam and as I say and here is
the uh the the flag the flag of gcam as
you guys know this is from that flag wer
we had in our NTB episode back in the
summer of
2023 um when we were waving the flag
when made the NTB flag that was great
time great times anyway um I think let's
get into these articles as well and what
do you think about this theme I mean
it's green on black and then we have the
white here but the font is legible you
even have to search it I do miss the
image that was here but you know you
guys can go find that image it's in one
of the stories um and we also we still
have the search bar we have everything
that we need to have here we have the
archive we have labels if you want to
search through this but we have so much
coming into it we have picked a name of
our new character and I can announce
this that the NOS 16 turning 17-year-old
character in the book the new character
who will become a part of gcam the most
powerful on our greatest Ally in the
school according to the to the thing and
we're going to have a lot of things I've
been looking over some old intelligence
reports you know and you know we we have
lots of things that's happening here you
know it's goingon to be kind of a
complex situation but her name will be
and it's confirmed to be it's not going
to be like SP Lana from adventures and
odys it will be summer so welcome to our
new character summer everybody and that
article is already written or almost
already written have over 500 words on
it as well so let's get into the story
so let's get into um the fall of G cam
our greatest Ally um written December
28th
2024 all right so as you guys can see we
have the flag of gcam on the screen
and I tried to you know actually image
editing this ties in the tech image
editing is actually easier on my phone
phone or some of the applications and
you know sometimes like I talk about oh
my goodness they don't make any programs
for your phones anymore it's terrible
it's terrible it's bad but actually you
know it's kind of feeling better on my
phone to do things even with the spin
being stuck in there and broken broken
off is it feeling better to do things
than it is to do on my computer because
of course you know like paint.net which
is free image editing software is
terrible and glitchy anyway the fall of
gcam my greatest Ally um was written and
we talk about the Fallout was clear from
the start Addison was now the clear
leader during the steud go of meeting I
was secretary and this was not a
parliamentary system my side had the
majority obviously this is referencing
how in parliamentary governments um you
kind of have like coalitions and then
those coz come together and they pick
someone they pick a prime minister so if
this was in Europe let's say France or
yeah let just say France then I would
have been leader like elected half most
people delegates
and the random people inside of student
council would have voted for me kind of
like how in D story was saying how will
the elections should
Alison I said Allison right yes yes
let's go for Allison Allison
um this like Allison left like was being
portrayed in the early story is how
would the new leader be elected or would
just be secession which is make Geneva
president but then who would be vice
president right would it be V would it
be me would it be Molly of course you
know setting up Molly to be when was set
up to be like um the I mean she she is
on tape she is on tape smacking kid in
in the face of the shoe and with the
Hydro
Flask uh so you know we we we don't want
people who throw
metal
objects in positions of
power now that that is that's a sentence
I never thought I would have to say
anyway so that's what the thing was talk
that's that's what we're talking about
here but we talk about fiscal
responsibility how they C to a
$65,000 from funding F pH fundraisers
every week and our agreement to have
unity and work together for better
school G Camp right this is alling how
they try to get me to speak for him and
then kind of didn't nothing thing anyway
um I arrived to school on the mission to
make a better place unfortunately we
have lost lot of characters here like we
have lost some deaths and this is
probably why aism never took over the
school right cuz you know I mean at the
beginning of the St we have a bench we
have a great bench toward the end of the
story and into 2024 this story will end
in like 2024 of
December October right unless I get
updates back then I can keep it going
but then we'll also have tips on how to
do things right so we're almost done
guys we're almost done we we are in
January of 2024 in the story right which
means I have to keep writing because I
like to be two months ahead because I
don't want know years to La
anyway we The Fallout of was clear and
the start Allison is now the clear
leader oh yeah I have just go on the
Miss like I'm saying we we have a great
bench let me start off into school when
we start off in 2023 and Ethan Shay is
running for president when we have AA
who could be on the bench to be
president next next year then we have of
course the vice president then we have
Maria then we have okay yeah like half G
cam okay half of gcam would all be ul
and then we have um you know kind of
Outsiders that we have sitting around
like Natalie and Jayla we have people
sitting
around right that could run they said no
but I mean it it's hypothetical right
besides they start off at six and they
start skyrocketing High famous right um
of course they we have Denver set up in
ninth grade so you know that's like deep
bench right toward the story and also
Hazel like remember how in the beginning
of the story SSA tried to prop up
hazelismyspirit
is essentially JV in allied with the
president Addison then we got gcam which
has
been in this story multiple multiple
times you you'll know them we know them
right um they're even basically part of
the campaign team of uh eth sh in the
book series right which I will link the
book like maybe here or here so you guys
can buy when you guys come to the
website right and then of course we got
SSA all m g Cam and then like INB which
is ninth grade boys so but now we we
have lost some people we lost AA we lost
Hazel we lost who else did we
lose I think we lost one more person oh
yes we lost Valerie so we kind of lost
uh uh what we call terroristic threat
but uh what we didn't lose was Molly we
didn't
lose uh Eon so you know it's good
because if we lost mly and Eon I mean
know there's no story here anyway so
yeah we have lost some people here but
least won have a rise I can I I can't
attach that there will be a rise of of
events happening
right you know how always refer oh you
know chased behind the W of the school
well this is this this is what's
happening as soon as summer comes in and
she gets established as a character well
then you know out out behind the woods
we got
anyway um so then the characters they
all come together they pledge the US the
Texas the Christian flags and they say
the Pledge of Allegiance correctly
imagine anyway um they stay they the ad
Administration calls in all the 11th
grade girls all of them so G cam is
primarily 11th grade three three2 split
um and then jvn is
also and the presidency and the
administration is mostly 11th grade go
this is this is a student council
meeting just you know without Eon that
is literally it and Denver that that's
what this is okay so anyway I re this
like Denver what do you think this is
about so I guess this technically makes
me president uh as the president in VP
are in the meeting with they attack they
all have hedge of State in the same room
oh yeah yeah I almost forgot since AA
left um Eon is now secretary so it's
makes him Technic thir command because
there's no speaker of the house so that
would make Eon thir in command anyway so
also you know uh attacks are not
unprecedented here at this school um you
know we had the chemical the chemical
perfume then we also had the
uh um well there was the locker thing
where the locker uh the the thing was um
stolen bags was stolen right out of then
was lacku so you know attack not
unprecedented here right so I guess this
makes me Ethan president for for like 30
minutes anyway
um SSA had contained moling also because
valer is not there so you know that's
like half of your group gone right youve
contained Molly um and because while
while you came at lost a down the person
R's Wing is also weakened by the loss of
battery SSA keep going keep it up going
like was easily keeping up with Molly J
and G but we still need that in
intelligence right so we had the
technological in the intelligence gaing
superiority though an iron H had
descended around G which is falling
deeper and deeper into IR relevance
right we are starting to note on the
trackers on the statistics on the
metrics that they are falling deeper and
deeper into unpopularity within the
school and do that guess what happens
you get hazel fight right Hazel was
essentially sitting up there you know we
had her at number three and you know
what happens at number three they lost
31 to 14 in the college football playoff
right
um they they they got destroyed and we
cannot have that happening to you know
SSA allly number number three is like
gam right so we we we cannot have that
happening because if gcam collapses then
d goes all of the state and school
secrets with them G collapses then you
know you have people who couldn't seek
in to move within the power vacuum right
the power vacuum will come and suck in
right and if that happens then that
could Seline s say from new experiences
anyway back to the story um that's a
they can now keep so of course we have
to keep up with all these kids here
right so you work through um what's
going on we try to figure out what's
going on we go in right and even though
the Ethan sa for GCA campaign got
suspended again um showed that Geneva
could lose toale in a head-to-head race
right which is essentially just showing
popularity that on the screen right and
of course we show how ver coming in as
the third power could can can come in um
then polling done by Nathaniel that's
twoo hour in polling specifically by
Jayla and Natalie will more popular than
G K's power obviously J&T principal but
Natalie has something going on so she's
kind of irrelevant but right now to the
story well it will become very very
relevant soon anyway this makes sense as
the JC pin prevailed and um from a geop
political Theory it makes sense as well
all right so essentially what we're
working with here is like we said the
school runch on a dating based economy
right a dating based economy means that
you can keep this up so it's not free
market it's not like it's a stock market
yet um there's not
um there's not anything of that nature
but if you have a dating based economy
that means what happens in dating will
turn into what happens in high school
you know geop politics C 9th grade has
to date UPS right now there was that
whole Sienna thing right but you know
Sienna is mostly seen as a flip on the
radar of SSA intelligence right due to
how things stck out with them because of
metrics right to it's more nth grade
boys and ninth grade girls um they have
to go up upwards through 10th grade 10th
grade which means lead through the jnc
principle then of course 12th grade
except for SSA again M image of ninth
grade except in in entirely politically
and Military neutral and kind of
irrelevant for to story like there's
only been three no two of the nth
graders at 12th graders mentioned in the
story other than Ethan sh which is
absolutely insane okay so basically most
of the work is 10th and 11th grade jbn
and G cam you know really really hyper
focus on that we have is say what are
they going to do how are they going to
um uh change the events how are they
going to work together in their also we
have the side PL
of Ethan Shay and his his his project to
um have a summit together in the mall
right we also have the side project of a
whole bunch of other uh invasions that
are getting um planned planned on
starting right we have operation Last
Chance operation Last Chance 2.0 we have
side projects like um you know how will
Shay make friends in school those those
are all kinds of side projects side
quests as they called them in video
games right side
projects um that are going to happen in
the school of
course um gcam has a lot to do with it
in fact on April April um I want to get
the date correct let's see let's check
the calendar
here it is January 4th today that's a
Saturday I'm going back in time to
April
April 13th yeah because we had a podcast
episode on the 12 skip right oh wow
trophy people here 12 people we talking
about the 12 wow amazing anyway on April
13th it will become very very important
April 13th 2024 all
[Music]
right interet military politically
neutral and only to class of clans
forign policy that's a reference to the
video game of course as say would work
with the T oh one more
sidequest so also according to also you
know there's uh the the 2024 project
there's
um there's the there's the Summit
project you know working with d cam but
there's also one more project to spread
democracy and freedom across the world
school anyway um SSA needs to turn
profitable right SSA has been doing lots
of things for no money and some of the
things didn't cost money but you know it
is a business okay we're not a charity
here um so there was the whole election
thing right election didn't cost money
but it also didn't make money um then
there was the
didn't cost too much money because of
the whole side Tech business that
supported it but they didn't make any
money as well there was all the
investigations into uh the election as
well which also
didn't make money you didn't cost money
but there's lots of these up things here
that don't cost money but didn't make
money if we don't make money then hey
we're not profitable we're not business
which is a bunch of kids running around
and B um they
can't in advaned what kind of software
that they want to make what or what what
they want to do right let's say you want
a new computer new cell phone anything
like that um new new software to help
with the agency well what with what
money so we need to um hurry up and
become um profitable so what we do we
link up we go in with the most popular
kids in the school and we start having a
plan also because of aa's departure
because of aa's departure right you now
have kind of like a split power vacuum
within gcam and unfortunately we didn't
get to explain this well kind of a split
power back from here because we have you
know we have CLA and Geneva here in 11th
grade sector oh andala sorry forgot
about who and should become relevant
later on down the line um but now the a
is not double anymore because a was gone
and then um we have Maria here right who
is in a really interesting and
precarious position it will become key
key to the plot um of the story here
like what what kind of position are we
going to have like let's say we M right
neutral but also in
gcamp right so you know you have these
people here you like coming coming
together you know the the whole battle
within 11th grade
but anyway sorry sorry about that anyway
the neutral the neutral battle within
11th grade but you also have the people
in 10th Grade that are that are not
talking about anything right so um with
within this neutral geopolitical context
um how will she react to let say the the
the neutral jvn powers the J Jayla and
the N Natalie in the um in in in jvn
right so this will be really interesting
foreign policy also means 10th grade is
weakened it is a power vacuum it is
split straight down the middle right so
like we said nth grade is nth grade and
12th grade A M image are all boys we
have uh 11th grade basically all girls
now we have split 10th and um 10th grade
straight down the middle 11th grade has
most of the political power they have
the presidency the vice presidency and a
whole bunch of senators um on their p on
their Pap in fact two out of three of
the
presidential candidates were 11th grade
girls right um the other one 12th grade
and also boys so it's completely about
event all right U anyway SSA Jayla and
Natalie for a special profitability
project we need more agents in the 10th
grade right 10th grade is probably going
to collapse it's in a power vacuum right
in the militarization of gcam they need
to militarize okay this this is a war
okay and they're sitting around here
watching Instagram reals okay I do not
understand how that is absolutely at all
profitable okay and then we got jvn
who I don't know anyway gcam made no
moves recently nothing according to
public Instagram data pre pre War a
joint gcam jbn Summit have been made to
a Kindra Scott location at the mall
which is why I investigated Kendra Scott
all right so in fact let's see
Kendra Scott I I didn't even know that
was a post that was some brandom
business or something like that okay I
spent my time scrolling and
investigating KRA
Scot
anyway U let's see if we can find him
here
um let's go into X advant search anyway
well we'll we'll we'll get back we'll
get back to you later anyway we got to
get back to we still have more story to
tell people more story to tell anyway so
there was a summit that was made into
kind SC which M War started quickly but
why we still need to investigate the
back soory into why the GK J War even
started right we we need to know why War
started like we know why a lot of War
started right but this one we don't know
why anyway both teams got what they
wanted V and Congos president gcam has
the seats and Ally in 12th grade Ethan
Shay um which means they could have done
something more which you their advantage
and here is what we talk about on CSM on
CSM if that CSM account still existed
which is NV anyway I'm like what if what
would you do if you were five girls and
you all had the same amount of political
power if you if you all had the same
amount political power in the school and
you also had control of the news what
would you do they're like take out the
trash or something like that also when
we go on there and we start going on and
yeah think about they start asking what
they're going to wear well for for the
summit why do I care what they're going
to
wear they're over here talking about oh
it's so important what do you
isca okay no okay no that's not how this
works anyway we're getting off track
here
um we need to invade
uh uh gam we should however it doesn't
deal with the problem the star
basketball player and the number one de
for the sake of gcam and SSA gcam must
remain strong however blah blah blah
blah blah I'm not going to read this
whole story to you okay it's not it's
not a podcast anyway Cody and Clarissa
are talking Geneva left you know see she
problems of leaving in some of these
stories right um Maria looking at
Instagram rules on an iPad and IM
messaging I me I sit behind the table
inconspicuously then Molly Molly walks
by and the most shocking thing happens
they talk to each other and I find out
from the people
as they were
talking gcam had collapsed the war is
over and yes from a Christian
perspective because yes technically this
is a Christian
novel it was a good thing but what
really keeps gcam stable if gcam
collapses if gcam does not have its
enemy what would happen think about USA
USSR right well when USA has a point to
exist with of that USSR that's why I had
no point of existing but what really
brings gcam
together I mean really what what what
have they developed as characters in the
story they have't now true true that's
because there's not enough intence
documents to figure out everything it's
not like we have copies of the text
message records but they
cannot mostly from what we have the
story which is basically based on
intence documents and based on
transcripts and based on comments and
based on all of that we do know what's
what's happening also if they hear this
thenum me anyway back to to the next
story um here we
have there's no pause anyway uh
we are you online yeah how many people
are online 12 anyway what are you talk
what are you talking about did do the
next story we arrive back at base where
G Cam's fall is imminent we back at base
and time is running out without the
threat of jvn but really held GM to
g a story what do a real life story no
kind of what it's fake who are these
people that listening to it it's fiction
how am I supposed to know why I'm sorry
are they commenting no I'm only
commenting anyway dude
what okay let's talk about this
okay bye anyway I R back to base oh wow
that's a nice uh theme I like how the
the first and green it's
good no one's commented yet all right
any running out without J will we help
gcam together we've already been through
this um but so we talk about the
isolation foreign policy and what was
helped by m Prim aspirations right
vacuum that echo on global stage for
years to come right that we talking
about like all these people just leaving
and pulling out then you know who who's
going to be president in 24 25 26
because you know if they're not there I
got to get new random people going to
run anyway then we talk about e8th grade
and then we talk about the Valentine's
Day national security measures that we
plan of course Sienna Sienna's going to
come right back into the story we look
at our question that you know we have 12
people 10% of the school both internal
external
relationships and here is the document
real document names changed of course
and level three so um we
got
bro how could I did I mess it up is his
name Devon or Dean anyway we got Allison
and external Allison and okay it's about
anyway we don't really go into Addison
as much he's kind of like oh president
that's that's
important anyway
lockers security we brought up the
lockers anything anyway this article
basically sets up the rise of Summer and
when summer shows up things are going to
change irrevocably for the school all
right so that's all for the SSA ltw um
series for now oh wow 13 people um now

we can talk about today so that you know
this stays a Tech podcast and not a high
School geopolitical podcast and speaking
