<h1>TheTechBoy Podcast EP 16</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the this week in
the tech boy podcast we should have been
up to a lot of things this week where I
have and um I hope you guys have been
enjoying what I've been doing this week
so I did a couple of YouTube videos
first of all I did my
um YouTube video on the Nokia 3310 3G
from 2017 and I was gonna do a few bit
of rundown on this you can go into the
video to get a little bit more nuance
and specifications right so first of all
this phone is running a Java based
operating system I actually was able to
install an application on here see the
clock icon
there it is it's supposed to be a uh
application that tells you the times in
different locations I haven't set the
time on here so it doesn't know that for
sure but let's start off with the first
post that I posted today and then we'll
move on down
all right this is the uh juxtaposed JS
review and tutorial so juxtaposed JS is
a software that allows you to make image
sliders that will let you show images
side by side some websites use it and I
actually used it in the post in a post
once and I actually had to go to a
website that was using juxtaposed JS
clicked image find out how to use it
like on the website like find out what
it's called and everything like that so
it's really complicated so I really hope
that you guys guys enjoy this um post
here so that you um know how to do this
without having to go to that website
whatever website it is so please go to
juxtapos juxtapos.js post and read the
tutorial all right oh yeah yeah
I was trying to save this for later but
guy Nest 22 plus brand new phone the a71
that I had previously will be listed on
eBay I'll even put the listing on here
and I actually got a new case here by uh
Silverback and I can give you some
specifications on the case right now it
has a nice little stand here
um when you stand that vertically it
sometimes tends to fall
um the s22 plus is nice this is kind of
hard to get into the case until I found
out that you have to take it apart piece
by piece and it looks pretty doable it
has a clear back so I can still see the
awesome green color that I ordered here
with my green wallpaper and a small
little selfie camera you can go see some
of the selfie camera footage that I have
in some of the videos that I've been
doing since uh the a video I posted on
the look at was uh edited and recorded
for all from the s20 plus no computer
interaction at all so please tell me
what you like there
um the camera performance seems decent
um 50 megapixel mode is okay I mean
sometimes it blows out some colors but I
took a picture of two different things
and um I was able to see how I was able
to get more text on one page than it did
on in on the same thing with that 50
megapixel mode on but detail on the
entrance is a better one bit wonky the
battery life is still optimizing I think
but it seems okay I've asked something
about seven hours of screen on time
um yesterday six hours that listening to
YouTube I was doing some work on the
computer
um there's an orange on display
um you can see it here is using the or
leading
um Bixby routines Bixby actually forgot
to cover it once but I got Bixby on here
got Samsung Dex which I got to use today
my dongle came in and I collected into a
monitor automatically turned on it was
nice um a little bit it's a bit buggy
I've been experiencing more bugs than
usual on Android 13 like sometimes
secure folder will ask me for my
password but instead asking for my
fingerprint or ask me for my fingerprint
twice
um but in all right I like the phone I'm
still getting used to it no headphone
jack no micro SD so if you are going to
get it uh
um I would get the 256 gigabyte version
and I would prefer a bit more RAM on
here uh the foam you know it's using
eight gigs of RAM I use about five to
six gigabytes of RAM so maybe 12
gigabytes available to be great for
future proofing it there's also the nice
Smart
Suggestions widget here
it tells you what app it thinks you're
going to use and then you can go down so
I actually think it's good for
one-handed use and you can see already
just by turning the phone on uh I got
I'm using 3.8 gigabytes of RAM and oh
yeah the screen for some reason I can't
go into the screen settings and change
the if it's going to be the screen
there's only under S3 to also but that's
okay it gets up to 107 1 700 nits of
brightness the camera seems pretty
decent there is a bit of shutter lag but
you can fix that by going into an
application called
it's a uh uh what's it called
application that allows you what's it
called uh
oh good luck yeah it's a good life
module yeah sorry guys it's a good lock
module called um
smarts
camera assistant yeah so if you go into
camera assistant you can um change them
into settings in in camera systems and
you can just change click the toggle
that says faster setup it says it will
make the image quantity Woos or not
worse but like it was it will decrease
the picture quality but I mean fast shot
is nice so I turned it back on
um
yeah s20 plus call Quality excellent I
like it
um what else it has 128 gigabytes of
storage gigs of RAM like I said
um we can run probably whatever you
throw at it look at my Fusion I've been
trying to run a bit of Linux on you not
that much success since
um
you know it's kind of it's I wanted to
get some more Linux apps on there
to VNC viewer and Android Nix and you
know applications like that I've been
installing more apps and user on here
because I figured out how to get a
non-gmailed Google account on here so I
have the Play Store I got the Galaxy
store
um they had two different screen modes
Vivid normal
um USBC
supports video out unlike my a71 5G so
that's nice so I can build the screen
all use Samsung Dex or I try to use
Android 13's experimental desktop mode
but I couldn't get it to work it freeze
up but you know Samsung has its own
decks on there
um e-sim support if I actually go into
the settings I can convert my sim to an
ECM but I probably won't do that so I
can put my sim and other devices from
time to time
um Bixby imagine routines uh stacked
widgets
as you can see here I can change my
widget
then there's email
calendar and then there's my goodness
but I've also been experiencing some
bugs like I'm on my wefter station the
cross view is saying what's it 836 yeah
it is all right it's saying and my
little cross view widget is showing the
temperature in celsius but I'm
Fahrenheit but you know wait
you know that's my new bug but you know
I can convert it on the phone of course
with the calculator
and you know oh another big issue is
that in Shakir photo YouTube's not
allowing picture-in-picture
um anymore which is a big issue but I
get around that issue by using the
pop-up view for YouTube
um what else
oh
let's see I'm using buttons not just use
um and I have some good lock modules on
here that a lot that are different see
the uh
it's a vote which rotating rotating
um and I also like the new gestures for
opening applications in the split screen
you just hold the app we went to the top
half of the bot at the middle would open
a pop-up of the bottom half a split
screen and then hold it down to cancel
um it's pretty Snappy I have Google
discover on here when I press the G icon
uh uh since I'm signed in I can see
stuff I care about like the Texans and
the rockets and Tech stuff and then I
can scroll down over to the Samsung free
get the news video games I don't play
games but you know I could uh Samsung
watch which means I can watch free TV
shows sometimes I even have PAW Patrol
or
iCarly on here listen to podcasts on
here we're just gonna auto play so we
close that
um
so yeah I think it's a nice phone the
camera's good
I got three times Zoom 50 megapixels
um I signed in on a school account for
Lightroom
um so I can edit stuff there
lumafusion it's only twenty dollars
instead of thirty dollars
um you can now push the button five
times for SOS instead of four times for
emergency SOS
um let's see
it has a more powerful chip than my a71
the keyboard experience is iffy but I
can probably fix that
um what else I have some custom icon
packs on here from
um a good lock module that I used
The Edge screen is nice
I like Samsung deck so you know you know
it's a nice phone you can go into the
s20 plus with some questions of you to
read it and I didn't talk about battery
life though because you know it has to
optimize when you first get the phone
but let me see if it's still optimizing
oh yeah speaking of battery
um
I get 25 watt charging which is more
than enough for me I mean sure it's not
100 watt charging or anything like that
oh it's then optimizing it says a full
charge will last me about 10 hours so
yeah I'm gonna get about
this 10 hours of screen on time okay
let's see that oh yeah yeah speaking of
battery functions I get why this power
sharing which is nice I tested it on an
iPhone
that they I got it
two days ago yeah something like that I
had to take the case off
um what else
um
it also has adaptive power saving which
I think is a really neat mode it allows
me like when I'm using the phone it's
not in power saving mode anymore but
let's say it's detecting I'm not really
using it as much or as powerful I can um
it just automatically goes into adaptive
power saving mode and reduces the CPU
and the brightness of the screen
like I was saying it has an optimized
power mode that lets me
um just like the phone decides if it's
going to use all that CPU it also
reduces the screen refresh rate to 120hz
to 60 hertz which is okay I can feel it
a little bit but you know it's okay
um but you know Samsung's when your eyes
on here it's great I got the Android 13
update I should get 14 15 and 16. so
this phones last me for about three
years and then the security update after
that three or four years
um so a nice phone
um Samsung could do better like I said
headphone jack I don't really use an
image music the speakers are nice though
um Adobe Atmos built into it instead of
having to just listen to it in
headphones but um I guess it had a
micro SD card because I'm almost running
out of storage because this phone has
Samsung's raw uh capture Samsung's uh
expert photography mode Samsung's Pro
mode in the camera and pro video mode
and it also has
um uh Samsung
uh
astrophotography mode in the expert
white application all right now on to
the YouTube Tech rewind this is a video
I actually made this uh uh thumbnail in
figma the application that adobe bought
for web that's supposed to compete with
canva
um and these two these two pixels to
cassette and the remote are from uh
unsplash so nice um you can go in there
and watch the video it's just me
reacting to some YouTubers I personally
watch it's one of them I found a new one
um who would talk about their reviews
who are reviewing technology and it's
like a YouTube Tech rewind so go watch
it and please comment and thanks for all
the comments that I've been getting
lately on YouTube and a subscription 17.
thank you guys
um so that's all for today
um if you have any questions about the
S2 Plus some applications have been
crashing a bit I did download
let's see or if you want to know
anything about this phone just remember
you can send us an email and we will
