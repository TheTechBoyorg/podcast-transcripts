<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech for This
Week in Tech podcast
[Music]
and hello everybody this is the tech boy
and today we have a very special podcast
for you today as you can see we are back
on Chrome after using sidekick browser
and the site is loading properly today
um regarding my streaming setup I'm
actually using my Logitech camera the
quantity X you look pretty good to me so
I'm not using my phone camera today the
gimbal is charging and these are the
headphones sent to me by Galaxy tech
review the headphones do not have a
microphone so the audio is coming from
the Logitech camera
all right so we have plenty of
technology to get to today but first
let's get through our post here starting
with
um uh latest post here
um David TVs rt34 video walkie-talkies
you may be saying hey you posted this
August 1st of last year 2022 and yes
that's true but I put this here because
my keys for kids radio broadcast listen
to the interview listeners will be
coming into the site last what Saturday
yeah this week and I might want to get
something here because case for kids
radio is a cage radio station and just
with interesting the most so let's get
into why the bees had come back and the
reason I wrote this post is I'm not a
gamer but I know the Wii was very
popular and this made the SEO look very
good and it worked I got lots of hits
from not to be so thanks fans over at
not the B
anyway why do we should come back
um here's why so this is a picture of
our actual Wii because apparently there
are no Wii pictures on unsplash
kind of a shame because I don't have X
and PSY fixes so important to dust here
and if you zoom in here you can actually
see the editing that was done here to
try to clean it up
power to phone editing people I won't
phone editing and today I will actually
show off so I'm going to phone editing
applications that I use on my phone that
work offline okay you only have to
download a couple of modules and then
you have phone editing on your phone all
right great so first of all we're going
to talk about the motion controllers the
motion controllers
are truly interesting aspect of the game
no other game except for the switch has
come close to
um Wii's motion controllers in terms of
modern games all other ones have
abandoned it and the switch doesn't only
use real motion controls to just use the
little paddle thingies alright so motion
controls that should work so if the Wii
came out in 2023 better graphics
Graphics are underly look kind of bad so
if we have better graphics which we
um headed by a better processor and if
the controls had some type of yes I know
it's a Google style you control the
traditional controller that could go
along with it because the we had the Wii
controllers the nunchuck which connected
to the Wii controllers and apparently
there's some type of bowling ball
controller which looked really
interesting in that Mr Boss video that I
need to finish watching and
um what else
oh yeah
uh the steering wheel controller we put
the remote in and you see it's doing
well so yeah
so if we made a controller like you
would make games say like Madden or any
other popular games I don't play any
other games but if anyone knows any
popular games that are out there for the
PS5 for whatever
um tell me and then we could have them
go on to the thing right there because
whatever anyway more power more power
caused by the graphics and more popular
titles like Madden in the other video
games that are out there okay so
and I even had this weird idea where you
could use the switch maybe even the
switch light as sort of um
the Wii U tablet thingy
um to go with the
wait so tell me would you guys
um think that playing like this
[Music]
uh pretending that this is the switch
and that's the Wii Wii right there you
can play like that or they can make a
mobile app and Bluetooth connection
oh
wow all right um so conclusive tell me
what you think so do we come back
um so yeah guys tell me and thanks for
the comments here
um one comment you said that they would
love and updated Wii console and FM uses
it from time to time so congratulations
and thank you for reading the site
um all right YouTube shorts experiment
and I know someone won back now would
really appreciate and like this
experiment so I'm actually going to go
into a new segment right now but I'm
going to show you how to find
um what people are searching out on
Google search console so I'm sorry
Google search so let me play some
all right and now we're into a new
segment I'm going to show you some of
the research that we've been doing here
all right so if I did
um
all right and Welcome to our Google
Trends segment here so our search term
topic would be uh LG v40
which is the phone that we've been uh
most featured in the article and we have
it right here
LG v40 all right I've recorded the video
of this phone with the screen on it's
about the same length as the iPhone 4.
and then we're going to compare it to
the iPhone
4 right now for context iPhone 4 was
barely relevant for you uh 10 years ago
okay and even out the red graph here the
iPhone 4 practically beats it D so
basically in the US for every six to one
people who search for the LG V4 for the
iPhone 4 nobody searched for it
I mean
the iPhone 4 is literally beating at 70
to 2. the iPhone 4 wasn't out of it 10
years ago this is only a four-year-old
film okay and it's very powerful as a
QHD screen uh I think I might have done
a video about this oh I made a Twitter
post about how to screen it's still
crack you better than the s22 plus
screen okay and I'm pretty sure the
camera's good the camera's gonna have
just broken so I couldn't tell you any
camera samples okay it has a quad deck
headphone jack
um face recognition a dual two cameras
right here a fingerprint scanner on the
back and you know pretty decent software
I mean the iPhone 4 4 is outdated oh
like this is just in 2022 alone
and you may be like okay whatever this
tool interesting so I'll show you this
research here and then I'll show you
some more stuff that you can do with
this tool and it's going to be really
cool and that rhymes all right so first
let's watch both switch and let's go so
this is short one
LG v40
um short
[Music]
all right as you can see it's just LGB
40 being thrown off no specs just
showing that uh text on there tell me
what your phone is and this is the
iPhone 4 which has cracked screen
whatever it looks like a bullet got shot
[Music]
that video has over 1.2 000 views so
thank you to all the people who viewed
my video here but I mean they'll see 340
come on Amazing food right here can wire
the C charge I think it has a glass back
and it has a headphone jack okay stuff
you don't even see on my defense today
oh it has microSD card slot although it
only has apology 64 megabytes a
gigabytes not megabytes of storage all
right so the experiment is over and the
first video is vaccinated all right
anyway so I learned the iPhone videos do
a lot better than LG videos okay I
already knew that from watching one back
no but I have to do my own experiment
all right I was shocked because iPhone
14 is old okay it was barely relevant 10
years ago it was released in like 2010
it's 2023 now so it's like a 13 year old
phone
running iOS like 7.1 okay this is
running at least I think you can update
it to Android 10.
um
but my theory is hey iPhones are very
popular and B LG's at the mobile
business and see the iPhone 4 is so old
that it's in the Retro Tech segment all
right so yeah beats about 72 and I woke
up and checked the stats and I like this
line here I said the iPhone video was
destroying LG videos Wilson Georgia did
to TCU and the college football playoff
and that is a statistical correctness
because it was beating it at one point
one point two thousand to about three
okay then it finally metal it out at 1.2
000 to 435 so what does this mean I'm
probably gonna have to start uploading
more iPhones so once it's up you know I
don't have hundreds of iPhones lying
around the studio nor do I have hundreds
of Android phones so I'm trying to find
an application that will allow me to do
some augmented reality put the phone in
my hand like this and go
but so maybe like all right that's nice
and all but I'm gonna know how uh you
did your research segment and that is
coming up right now all right and now
we're doing some research segment here
on Google Trends and you may be like hey
this is useful and let me show you all
right so
let me show you this tip here so it'll
show you an avid uh Adventure is an
odyssey fan you know I'm a bigger than
she's an odyssey fan and um I want to
know where I can talk to kids all over
at the United States records and odyssey
songs
of course this won't be a property video
but listeners but uh most people
probably listen on the club and online
anyway and
so I could check the amount of stats
over here so I've checked this a little
bit and okay so I live in Texas so this
would be an amount of people
um searching in the United States for
adventures in The Odyssey here so
basically the darker the blue color the
more people that listen
so here in Texas such interest is 22.
which is you know kind of low it goes up
to 100. but if you go on canvas the
search engine says 100. so that means I
probably have a statistically likely
better chance of finding an event to an
odyssey fan here in Kansas then I would
in Texas even though Kansas City is the
smallest state than Texas so maybe to
spread out more so let's go to the
fourth big estate in the union let's say
Montana
all right and they have a higher search
interest in Texas with 85
oh recipe it's 46 43 and Alaska with a
search interest of 100 maybe all right
in Pennsylvania for some reason there's
no one in Vermont this is an odyssey
like
this is great oh and Rhode Island
that's weird all right
so hmm you know what if I wanted to do
some type of uh War you would say if
there's an odyssey versus
Brinkman
another question Audio Drama to see
which one wins search and in all right
makeman Avengers is red Adventures in
Odyssey is blue and
dank that is so oh woman all right wait
maybe maybe kids are searching with
vapors in Adventures you know let's give
this
uh this gives a chance
okay they're not searching that
something just right you know let's give
everybody you know it's been around 35
years when the most popular event audio
dramas you know it has some a whole lot
heavy heaters let's do kishuki's idea
okay oh
if it's nice she's just crushing it all
right anyway next so I don't care about
Adventure now obviously no one cares
about Adventures in Odyssey
anyway okay
um so let's see you want to do some more
technical research let's just say uh
[Music]
who do you think is going to win Samsung
s22 or the iPhone 14. let's see 13 this
is 13. all right
all right there you go
man I can't spell today there we go
Samsung s22
and see how well it's done over the past
12 months in the United States if you
want to change countries oh this makes
sense so this is like February they
launched in the uh yeah
and you can change countries in
worldwide let's do the iPhone 13.
so what I'm expecting is the Samsung
will win because iPhone 13 was released
in October which isn't shown on this map
let's see if we can change it
oh
wow
and this just shows how much
iPhone videos just do better than I mean
okay okay
you know Samsung s22 let's do this 22
Ultra
all right
oh man it's trouncing uh all right let's
just take the s22 ultra away and just do
Samsung all right Samsung said beat the
iPhone 13. if the entire company of
Samsung just doesn't work then it's
gonna say it
there we go so the entire copy of
Samsung basically can trans iPhone but
the iPhone is still holding a channel
which is impressive
if we just put any LG phone here
like I don't know uh
oh dang
all right well you know how do you feel
it's kind of old to say uh 2004 present
so the government wasn't around back
then and
yeah so so I can show you how to use
Google trends for a detailed research so
that's interesting and now on to the
next segment
and I hope you guys like that sound
effect we are now at the techboy.org
where we will go off to the next post
where you say if the audio quality is
good on the Nokia 3310 3G and be like
why did you write disposal okay 3310 for
3G is like a six year old phone and the
12 days I need I was trying to push
stuff every day and I had to write
something so I could do it tweet 10 2G
and you also get a nice little Nokia 3G
3G video and I don't know especially
like this piece
if it does
that is the startup sound let's go Nokia
all right
um the audio quality is not that good
and the speakerphone on not FM radio so
that's it
that's it until the next second one I'm
going to talk about my Public Square
profile
all right here we go Public Square
it's not reminding me in any way if you
join Public Square okay so if we
the local christian disc business
Marketplace anyway I was able to join I
got Public School verified and there's
this little social network where you can
chat with me and I'm doing a little AMA
on here which is nice and fun and fair
all right but you know what's not nice
and fun and fair today's

[Music]
oops I forgot something my YouTube
segment so I'm gonna have to edit that
out and let's go on to the next thing
all right we're on our YouTube segment
here
youtube.com all right and let's go to
techoi
where are we
um reacted to Ben Shapiro's chat GPT
video which is interesting it's a very
did I lose a subscriber
someone
unsubscribed oh no whatever all right
um this is my detective Boy chat GPT
video and thanks you guys for watching I
react to his chat GPT video it's really
interesting really funny and used to go
watch it I really liked the video and it
that's the video that was the original
what do all right I also uploaded a
video called um
I hate Tick Tock part two and we're all
gonna watch that right now I know I know
you don't want to see me react to tick
tock again but you must if you have to
suffer the torture of that right now and
I'll give you a uh explanation here and
you also have seen me draw a phone in
Samsung's AR which I thought was
interesting
confused right here under USBC ports in
Chevy SUV all right here we go I hate
Tick Tock part two this is your reaction
to me to me watching a Brett Cooper
video very good video uh host used to go
subscribe to who who was watching some
dumb Tick Tock videos and I was just
like seriously how are people getting
abused to this he got they got featured
on her show yeah it would be dumb but
they got featured on her show and Matt
Walsh's show
um but I'm saying like come on
they're so dumb that they became popular
and I'm creating big content so this is
what this video is why is Tick-Tock so
popular some guy just comes on like tick
tock this is like oh I hate America so
then he just goes like
it was literally Green Seafood on the
map what else I was reacting to him he
has over
2.06 million subscribers it's insane
like
I took tons of work into quality content
you can barely get me used these random
people are scoring
I mean some of the videos like five
seconds long have a little bit of text
we don't even have any like talking they
just pick some random songs
degraded this much in society this is
crazy come on people
all right and that is me reacting to uh
that's a scam that is a scam do not go
and buy that
um all right that's me reacting to tick
tock and white Tick Tock is popular and
for the last time now I probably won't
answer that anyway bye and Tech talk to
you later
