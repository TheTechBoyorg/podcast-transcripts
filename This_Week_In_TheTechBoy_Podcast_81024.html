<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 81024</h1>
<pre>hello and welcome to the tech boy This
Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast Hello everybody welcome to this
week the tech boy podcast um hopefully
you guys are having a great week I got
to test out the Galaxy Z fold and flip
today went hands on with them so um
we're going to go over that and also
like I promised we're going to go over
Mr who the boss's um sad worldview and
so let's let's get into that so um then
speaking of Mr whoer Boss
um my
uh I I tested the the claims he made
about the Z flip and fold and um I'm
going to see if they're true or
not and also another of news on um
things that we've done um across the the
internet interwebs apparently kids don't
know what the national AMOM is which is
really sad so make sure you go check
that out as
well oh also lots of SSA ltw updates um
coming through so hopefully you get
um you get to see what they are and I'm
just transferring the photos and videos
over
to the uh computer but without further
Ado oh wow he's only 55 Subs 55,000
sorry subscribers away from Wow we
already got a comment hello LJ nice to
see you in here again um um if you want
to come on you can just text me and um
so here's our Mr Boss video without
further Ado we're going to be looking at
these from a Christian perspective this
is the Drone video of his from his
wedding uh here it is 5 DRS we're not
going to watch to because I think it's
like 15 minutes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
design a training program guys here the
video and there's some commentary here
the the technology uh behind those
drones is very impressive in my
[Applause]
[Music]
opinion I talk for a living you guys
probably know that this this is going to
be the toughest speech that I have ever
done in my life I'm probably going to
cry and you've seen me cry a lot of
times already so that's probably no
surprise I used to find the idea of Fate
impossible to believe I would which um
from a Christmas perspective I don't
believe oh hello Robert ker I don't
believe in fate I believe in God and
God's Providence and things of that
nature insist to people life is like a
deck of cards being shuffled and dealt
in no particular order but as I stand in
front of you today and in front of the
most beautiful woman I have seen in my
life here's why I think I was
wrong I think it's really easy to feel
lost I think we all feel lost at points
both on a personal level you know my
career isn't going anywhere my friends
don't really like me I'll never find a
partner but also on a bigger un and yes
from a CHR perspective that can make
sense sometimes people do feel lost and
depressed some of the time and wow we
already got four viewers on the podcast
so thanks guys for tuning in scale I
mean just look up there are 200 billion
trillion Stars up there and when you
look at just one star it's so far away
that the light from it takes a 100,000
years to get to you you're looking at
something that happened a 100,000 years
ago which no obviously the Earth is 6 to
10,000 years old and um the light um
from the start when they were created
just instantly got there and then it um
now the lights is now 100,000 um light
years away so that's how that works like
new stars that um are created through
supernovas and stuff like
that so where on Earth do we fit
into this vast picture we're made a
stardust oh no but seriously like
virtually every element inside of us was
formed in the
Stars it depends on what he's trying to
say with that yes we're made out of dust
and I supposed that there could be Dust
In Stars so sure we'll take we'll take
that we borrow it for a bit of time we
live our lives we laugh we cry and
then we return that Stardust back to the
universe okay but it doesn't really go
into the sky unless of course you shoot
yourself into the sky
purposefully it just you goes into the
do so surely surely everything that ever
happens in our lives It's All Temporary
no one's going to Care in 100 years
that's true which is why we have been
created you know to honor and respect
and worship God and to
um you
know glorify him
oh my gosh
I no one's going to remember in 500
years everything we will ever achieve
will live and die on this one tiny rock
floating in the middle of an indifferent
nothingness surely if the end
destination of life is death and that's
the only thing that we can say for
certainty which isn't true right there
is an eternity there's a heaven and a
hell um and that's what where his
worldview is messed up there's no um
death is not the final solution to
life then life itself is
meaningless this is something I which
since he believes this now he has to
come up with a way that life is
important or not meaningless to him so
here's how he's going to come up with
that think about a lot before meeting
gisha I would look at life through this
hypological hypocritical lens and would
continue to come to the conclusion that
when you ask enough questions no one has
the answers and eventually that there
are no answers there is no point a lot
of my ways of thinking stemm from very
early on like at school for example
people would act like I wasn't part of
the conversation that I was standing in
people would run up to me in the
corridors shout ugly in my ear and then
disappear before I could turn around and
that's really people told me I really
sad but if there is no God and if
there's no reason for life and there's
nothing that they're trying
to you know trying to do right there's
no reason do right there's no reason for
Morality and morality doesn't exist
because dud just W you he doesn't
believe in it um because you know this
like who decides what morality is then
he doesn't you know then then people
running up and shouting ugly pretending
he doesn't exist doesn't really matter
it's not really wrong because right and
wrong don't exist given the world view
that he's a spouse now let's see what
the comment say my biggest view is death
well you know with Jesus Christ if you
accept him as your lord and savior you
know you will become saved you'll get to
go to heaven when you
die single forever I felt invisible like
I could be standing there in a room full
of people and they could just walk right
through
me so to try and Escape that feeling I'd
keep my head down I'd avoid eye contact
I used to walk around like this all the
time because because that hurt
less I guess this is where he also gets
from a Tech perspective his love of
gaming because he um you know it's
something that you can do one-on-one
like in his videos he's always going
excuse me on and on about how much he
like the PS uh the PS Vista I think VTO
handheld and the Nintendo Game boys that
were coming out and the DSs um in 2004
and 2006 and I can see why um because he
you know was isolated in school but then
I found
YouTube actually not she's coming I
promise I made some videos online people
like them so I kept making those videos
and it felt like I blinked and suddenly
I was popular people had gone from
wanting nothing to do with me to being
in Wonder praising me people were like I
knew you could do it from the beginning
congratulations I had my money on you
from the start and you would think that
would be the cure to that deeply ingrain
need for a purpose that feeling of not
being good enough for the outside world
it certainly felt like it at the time
but it actually made it worse
the simple fact that people found me so
much more impressive on paper or over
the Internet when they were far away
from me than when I let them get close
meant that I decided to keep it that way
I created this outer shell for myself
this false perfect person Persona that I
become based on what I thought people
wanted me to be which um you know makes
sense and he doesn't really have much to
live for and he doesn't really have any
you know major goal intact because um
he doesn't believe in and half life or a
religion or anything like that which I
believe to be Christianity I'd adopt
other people's ways of thinking I did
everything I could to get every single
person to like me and i' never get too
close I'd always keep some distance so
they didn't know me so well they'd
realize I was the same old boring nerdy
lanky kid that had have been made pretty
clear to me that no one
like for those of you who knew me when I
was younger you'll know that I used to
love being
home when I was really young I'd cross
my arms angrily and I told people they
were stupid not letting me go home
that's kind of funny honestly and when I
got older I I did the same thing I just
did it
internally and it's not because we had a
TV or toys or a garden to play in home
was the only place where I didn't feel
the need to hide who I was this little
Sanctuary free from the judgment and
expectation that I tried to shelter
myself
from now I could well have lived my
entire life like this a silent lone
particle drifting within this enormous
Universe working laughing crying
ultimately without reason and that's how
sad this world view is from the
Christian Viewpoint you know um we were
created to honor and respect and worship
God
and to witness to others they told him
about Jesus's love and that's you know
what what's going to last in 500 years
right no one's going to care about what
the uh Vivo phones were the Samsung
Galaxy s24 Ultra was was back in the in
2072 right not or even in
2720 no one's really going to care but
but people are going to care about is if
you made it to heaven or to hell
but then I saw you drisha standing on
the other side of that busy London
Street looking right back at me wearing
the most beautiful smile I'd ever seen
in my
life Empower your students at every
stage of the writing process with
grammarly's generative
AI she was holding back a laugh watching
me Wheeling along this massive suitcase
behind me a tradition whenever I'd come
to London hanging and this is about 3
years ago so he was already an
established you know Tech YouTuber
blogging everything like that hello um
shark fin Tech and ljb says hello so
yeah you guys have some fun in the check
into things looking like I was about to
move in before I'd even met
her I locked eyes with her I laugh he
and the rest was history too bad they
didn't get this on a clip for YouTube
that would have been really nice because
you know he he was probably there to
film something of some tech event that's
what the suitcase was for this is only a
few years ago so I mean honestly he
could have
uh he he could have been filming
something the first time I met richer I
booked three different bars I've been on
enough dates at this point to know that
changing locations about once per hour
is a good way to keep things interesting
interesting of course we're not going to
test that out but you know if anyone
else wants to test it out and put back
please tell me we didn't leave the first
one also interesting that I wonder if
that's a us thing or I mean sorry not us
thing an England thing we're going to
three bars on a first date
is normal uh maybe in the United States
they do Starbucks what do kids
do what what do kids do
I it's mostly at school honestly what do
kids do okay that's going to be a
segment um coming up on the show um kids
of uh K Kids of the the chat uh where do
you people go take people when you go to
date uh you don't know that oh okay so
official chat Brit says he doesn't know
um well um two out of three of the
people in the chat are teenagers so um
tell me if you've ever been on the date
where do you take the uh other people
what is that face bomb okay uh let's go
I never ever wanted to leave the first
one which is also interesting because uh
in his engagement video his Hightech
engagement video really really good
video very fun very interesting good
usage of tech in it he um does say that
he the first thing that he does to take
on the date is a bar like in in his
escape room it's actually a bar we sat
in the very corner of the bar me trying
to see Macho by ordering a strong
whiskey based
mandering secretly wishing I could have
just had what she was having richer
proceeded to absolutely Slaughter me at
the Foosball table I'm pretty good at
foosball um it's fun hey I went to the
Galler I went to the Galleria today
we're going to be talking about that
because I went to the Samsung store you
go to a steakhouse so very um
expensive very very expensive um but
I've been to the Galleria before it's
very fun um especially the Samsung store
so we're going to get into uh that uh
after we finish I'm talking about and
discussing the worldview claims in this
video at which point I decided to just
drop the act and order the fruity pink
cocktail and then they have this little
bowl of popcorn at the table presumably
a snack in casee you got
hungry not a
dresser after a couple of hours of
having drinks I decided I got to go to
the bathroom and this is the point where
every girl I've been on a date with so
far every single girl does the same
thing they pull out their mirror they
made sure their makeup look good they
okay um I don't know if there any girls
uh in the chat and we'll get to your
chat messages soon but um do you guys
carry around mirrors in your pocket uh
uh this will get clipped and posted to
Instagram where
they presumably more girls and you can
answer in the comments but uh these kids
car mirers around in their pockets all
right let's see what that chat is saying
I would do an activity like mini golf
for going to the beach an activity you
can't just have fun just for going out
to dinner L but yeah do a Ab activity
then dinner then do whatever after okay
so an activity and dinner great great
advice for uh the people watching um
it's the small things that matter
showing that you at Le K true true
uncrease their clothing do you know what
I walk back into brisha doing seeing how
high she could throw that popcorn and
catch it in her mouth without
bounces okay that's I mean I wish he got
a video of that that would have been
funny like she's okay yeah my kind of
woman and when I finally had to say bye
to her that night and I watched her walk
away from me I turned around I cursed
and I did the weirdest thing that I've
never done before right there in that
moment I took out my phone and I took a
photo it's a photo of an empty Street it
doesn't have me in it it doesn't have
her in it I took that photo because I
wanted to remember that moment that I
wonder what kind of phone he had when he
took his photo I wonder work on a phone
that was might have been the s20 ultra
maybe electrifying feeling almost like
the universe itself had crept up behind
me to whisper in my ear and obviously
that's not true to you Universe does not
whisper you're
welcome do you want to know
why it's because she saw me too FIA
could see me clearer than anyone had
ever seen me before the real
me she refused to watch anything I put
online for the simple fact that she
wanted to know me for me and not what I
did or who I presented myself as
interesting um that that's an
interesting
um
take um I wonder if she watches now well
she works with him now but I wonder if
she uh if she like actually watches now
that or she just didn't like my
videos which I hope not his videos are
amazing um apart from you know the bad
worldview in you know this video his
videos are actually well put together
really well edited I mean this is an
actually example of what he consider bad
editing um because he has really good
editing and in flashing and his
animation it's really upbeat like I like
to watch these just for fun because
obviously you know I'm not buying of the
stuff that he's he's selling or not
selling but reviewing because it's
expensive and some of it doesn't even
come to the United
States read me like a book we'd say the
exact same thing at the exact same time
in the exact same tone so often we
decided we should just take turns when
speaking to people interesting
interesting uh I wonder what that is
like scientifically or psychologically
it's not obviously not you know Spirits
or something like
that and we had so much fun together
when we first met I go wow she loves
everything I love this is
amazing was well except for Android she
has an iPhone yes this is uh Mr who
Theos coincidence it took me much longer
to realize that the reason we love the
same things is because brisha is
relentlessly curious she is at every
opportunity to in the things I take
interest in that makes sense that makes
sense because it completely unlikely
even in a small like comparison country
uh like England to find someone who
thinks exactly the same way as you
without them you know doing a little bit
of uh research
beforehand but most importantly of all
she made me feel so D oh I'm to cut that
head is weirdly shaped you don't like a
cartoon character not good one that push
me head does not look weirdly shaped to
me look finally to create this spiky
hairstyle that completely M the shape of
my head and from the moment I did that
and the comment stopped I decided I
wouldn't dare reveal my true identity to
anyone
anymore anytime a friend suggested we go
swimming or out in the rain where my
hair would get ruined for years I would
Panic I'd find a way to avoid it and it
took me a very long time to show drisha
what I look like without the hair
because some part of my brain was
terrified that any San girl would leave
me in that
moment but when I did brisha stared
right right back at me with the exact
same attraction and admiration that she
always had I was so confused how anyone
could like the way I looked without
three gallons of gel in my hair I wanted
to run and hide myself 5 seconds and
plenty but she told me no Arin right
here right now in this moment the sad
thing about this is it's great it's
really great that his wife loves him and
that he loves her that's that's a great
thing and marriage you know has been
ordained by God but
it he
needs to have Jesus's
love covering him and loving him and
knowing that he's approved his selfworth
shouldn't be tied to you know his
YouTube channel which it isn't anymore
or his wife or girlfriend at the time it
should be tied to knowing that he
is created in God's image and and is
loved by God even if everyone else would
have stopped loving him even if he would
have lose all the subscribers he still
has inherent worth and dignity like this
you look
beautiful no matter what his hair looks
like I could slowly feel all those
burdens I've been carrying becoming
Bridges and my insecurity is melting
away the things I spent my tire oh wait
we got some more questions here how big
is my delay I don't know can you guys
hear well how why did I skip bro needs
guide yep yep oh I was just uh it was
just a little part I'm bleeping out uh
bad word
I like hiding from the world she showed
me how to be proud of them she made me
realize that trying to be this flawless
version of myself all the time to serve
other people was not just exhausting but
it would never ever allow which which me
to be happy which is true that is true
um what's it called that that is an a
story a theme um discovered in discussed
in Adventures and
ly I'm not perfect but that's what makes
me perfect for
her she told me to embody that to wear
that mtra like a badge to shout it from
the
rooftops so here I
am and with this unconditional
acceptance by embracing me the exact
same through both the good and the bad
brisha opened me up to love she allowed
me to both love and be loved more than I
ever dreamed of being able
to and so it's probably not surprising
that it only took eight dates before I
knew wanted to marry this girl we
weren't even boyfriend or girlfriend at
this point but I distin remember this
moment uh I wonder if that's normal of
course you know of the kids in the chat
you know or married hopefully but
um I presume that they've gone in more
than eight dates and obviously did not
buried so I wonder how how true that is
I was reading a book on my bed there was
a funny moment I laugh out loud funny so
I turned around to see her and I
realized she wasn't there and it was the
weirdest feeling because my entire life
if you'd ask me where I wanted to be I
would tell you one thing and one thing
only I want to go home except this
moment I realized that my this kind of
funny because in the SS ltw series you
know I'm always you know at school
because you know it's like I still the
wall I'm on podcast like there's there's
not much ssw experience to be you know
help there so the back the backdrop is
school it's you know just more exciting
um in real life and in literary form
answer had changed
I want to be wherever she is eight yeah
eight
dates if you've ever observed BR and ey
and a natural
habitat we don't let go of each other I
wonder what the natural habitat is maybe
it's like a bar or something unless it's
in Prett No Way Around It we don't leave
the 2 met vicinity within the other
person um for American viewers 2 met is
39 * 2 in or about six yards we've been
told multiple times we're
unbearable how's actually just today
but you do want to know why it's because
fundamentally rishia you are my home you
made me realize home isn't four walls in
a ceiling home is a feeling and in your
good good rhyming right there arms in
your eyes in your hands I Feel Home and
that's what love is to me
love your home your place um in in
creating these animations sometimes in
the United States we use these for
Fourth of July celebr instead of
fireworks because it's safer and you
know there's not so much smoke and it's
um quieter um but of course it's I think
it's a bit more expensive it's your
sanctuary and that peaceful reassurance
of knowing that you will be home till
your final
days you know every evening before we go
to sleep BR and I do a gratitude and
goal list five things are grateful for
that day and five things you want to
achieve that's pretty um unique I mean
it can it's very easy to find five
things that you great before but five
things that you want to achieve I mean
every day that
is almost over 15,000 not 15,000 1,500
achievements a year and if if he were to
achieve those um I'm granted that they
change that that would be very
impressive to achieve almost 2,000
achievements and every night you know
what she says she's grateful for she
says me I'm at the top of that list
every single time that's great that's
great you know what her top goal is even
after everything she already does for me
she says to be better for me that's the
type of woman Trisha is you know the
moment I proposed I've watched that clip
like 200 times at this point mostly
because the second I got down on one
knee the second I submitted myself to
her for the rest of my life her gut
reaction the first thing she did without
even thinking was not to gasp or go for
the ring she dropped down to her knees
with me and hugged me that is the type
of woman that brisha is and that's great
you can go see that clip on YouTube
actually um in that video they were
talking about it was captured I think by
his videographers and in Hightech night
vision C now here's what really gets me
about it though if you think about it
the chance of you having met the life
partner sitting next to you is basically
zero H I wouldn't really say that what's
the PO population of
um what's the population of England uh
okay he's he's in England right we're
not going to count all the UK because he
didn't go to Scotland or anything
anything like that it's about 56 million
people on 2018 estimate right and how
many population how many population of
England
women it's about 28 million so it's
about 51% of the country's population so
it's a pretty even um scenario and then
of course you have to splice down to the
people who are already married splice
down to the people who are in your age
segment and you have you know um you
know just a few million people um a few
million people there and he went to
London which a very popular city right
he's just walking down the street I mean
it it he the statistics work out so
that's that it would be possible for him
to meet him I wouldn't say that the
statistical chance is net zero and ljb
says he has submitted himself to God and
said yes because um a great marriage
first has to start with God and in in
defining your values with God go listen
to a focus on the family broadcast and
more expertise on day it shouldn't have
happened okay you had to be in the exact
right place at the exact right time your
parents had to be in the exact right
place at the exact right time in fact
every single generation before you had
to have done exactly what they did for
you two to have
met maybe but of course if you did
something different then you still might
have met each after okay
the chance is so close to zero that
betting against it would be the easiest
money you've ever made doubtful seeing
as the amount of people who have gotten
married and and and the concept of uh
what's it called soulmates
is I wouldn't say it's real okay like it
five minutes ago he said that Dr was
curious so she was molding herself to
become more like um Aon Mr the boss
right drisa when she was just you know
walking a year ago before uh before she
ever met Aon was not exactly like Aaron
she was a little bit different right um
Aaron changed because of dressa and
dressa changed because of Aaron right so
they just when when they decided to get
married and on their dates they each
became a little bit more like each that
they went um intrinsically coded by the
universe to become soulmates
which is why
like
yeah so the way that I take that is
either I am the luckiest man in the
world for bumping into this angel either
every single star had to align in my
favor or it's obviously it isn't
Christians Christians would say it's
God's Divine Providence which is true um
but it it's not stars aligning or the
universe aligning with each other okay
and also it's simple statistics and that
just her character um cause to to be
like that or
or it was going to happen we were meant
to find each other which I mean Ali
Stucky might actually agree with that um
sees calvinist I presume so she believes
that uh everything is ordained and elect
or something like that you can go ask
her about
that um but I but of course you know
from either her perspective or other
Christians perspective it it's either
God ordained but it's not uh it's not
the stars or Universe I can tell you
that other two people born and brought
up over 100 miles apart but so
unbelievably designed for each
other you could say designed by who a
might say that it's because of just
Society or his family or just the way
that it was they each grew up in similar
environments something like that or
different environments that caused them
to um become like each other I feel
Opposites Attract um
but I I wouldn't say that I really
wouldn't say that okay actually that
they were designed by God for each other
and I pray Mr and Dr um if they're not
already become Christian and accept
Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior
now that I see what my life is like with
you rishia I refuse to believe that my
life could have been without
you so standing here today underneath
this vast vast Cosmos surrounded by all
the people we loveia I want to thank you
because now when I look at the same SK
those are very interesting animations
right every single night I don't see
endless uncaring emptiness I see peace
you show me the Stars where I previously
saw the
void meeting you drisha always be my
greatest achievement meeting you drisha
has given me the conviction that the
Universe had a plan for us all along and
if you just switched the universe with
God the Divine the almighty he would be
right but right now he's wrong and
whether or not it was written in the
stars and we were destined to meet that
as long as we are together everything is
as it's meant to be and that the same
fate that brought us together that
allowed me to find my home and you to
find yours that fate will also guide us
forward I truly believe that and of
course there is no such thing as fate
when you prob hard enough into our
existence when you try and use cold hard
logic to calculate the purpose of our
lives and the true reasons why we do
things none of it makes any sense and
that was me for my entire life but youa
you have made me realize that while the
end point of life may be empty well
which it isn't the end point of life is
either two things Heaven or Hell
hopefully you want to go to Heaven by
accepting Jesus Christ as your lord and
savior every flicker eventually does go
out that doesn't make the purpose
meaningless the purpose of life is love
kind of like I said and I'll say it
again the purpose of life is to love and
worship God right it's not to love and
worship other people right humans were
created to worship if you don't if they
don't worship God don't worship of
anything
else nothing cures like love nothing
protects like love nothing endures like
love and so what I mean he's right you
go read the first Corinthians 13 just
not completely right can the objective
be but to give and receive as much love
as you possibly can in the time that you
have to not try and change the universe
but to see it as your canvas to paint
your love story
across Mark Twain once said
the two most important moments are when
you were born and when you found out why
and now that I found out why my life is
so simple all right and that's all um
that we're going to do for now let's
read with the comments and then we're
going to get into some more Tech
commentary ljb says there's no there is
such a thing as Faith the B says oh he
said faith not Faith um yeah the Bible
does say walk by faith there is such a
thing as faith not Faith fate is
different than Faith um all right now
let's get into our Tech commentary so I
did go it's Galaxy s20 sorry Z fold six
and the flip 6 and I actually installed
the goodlock module on device
so on the device sorry um that was the
wrong video um but first let's get to
the Galaxy z um fold Mr stos said that
um you
couldn't flip the uh the camera around
without opening the phone first and
actually shows that you can do that from
the cover display so
um the selfie with the front camera I
wish I could um pause
that yeah so um hopefully you guys got
to see that video on the screen um also
the G
Z I don't know what this is
let oh sorry all now we also have some
other Clips here that I have to share on
the screen so oh we have some
pictures
um oh yes so I was able to install the
correct good Lock application to get
full screen working on
the to get full screen working on the
Galaxy Z flip um so hopefully you guys
can see this on the screen let me pull
up my files
application all right here we
go so hopefully you guys can see this on
the
screen and I have something to say about
the cloud strike um thing next
so stay tuned for that
all right so uh video should
be uh oh the video should be appearing
on the
screen oh wait we have an Alo
coming oh we got some comments you
skipped one of my oh what was your
question sorry are we going to finish
the video from the last time um what was
the video I think we might be able to
get get it if you send it over again
um so hopefully you can see this on the
screen this is the Galaxy Z fold um six
um Notes
application um I'm going to share let
let's make this big okay um share
screen here you are this is the Galaxy
zold 6 Notes application um and I was
testing out the
drawing uh app app um so you're able to
draw stuff into photos so next photo uh
oh um so I drew this stick figure in as
you can see it is grayed out when it is
generating with autistic flare this is
on the oneui 6.6.1 update oh also guys
as soon as you can update your
phone oh okay you should be able to see
it now um LJ um as soon as you guys can
update your Samsung phones any Android
phone to um oneui
6.1.1 oneui the August um 7 security
patch because it is very crucial it
patches a very important vulnerability
that was able to get priv escalation
into Android so even in the password I
think it was able to get hacked into
using updated software so please update
your software because that exoit should
be up on exoit DB it even though I don't
know how to use it yet people do know
how to use XO 3B and they will Target
your Andro all right anyway that's just
a think unfortunately with that update
one 6.1 6.1 did not come 6.1.1 did not
come out yet so these features that you
see here are still Z fold six and flip
six
exclusives okay I'll install those
extensions later all right so these this
is comparison the Galaxy um like I did I
criticize the Galaxy Z flip and the um
camera because it does not have a
telephoto so this is three time zoom on
the flip I believe yeah so I have to
take that picture on the phone's flip
with my phone as you can see here when
you zoom in
the area around here is very it's kind
of blurry compared to the optical three
time zoom of my phone um when you zoom
in here it's is a little bit grainy but
it is more detailed this is using the
three times optical zoom camera of my
phone now when we move over here this is
a front facing picture taken with my
phone and I will say that on the flip um
the front-facing pictures were a lot
better um using the regular camera mode
I didn't use 50 megapixels but just
using the 12 megapixel camera mode now
here is the Galaxy Z flip here um it is
a bit blur it out but I drew a stick
figure into the um into one of their
test images here um just drawing your
own image onto an image that's a very
interesting feature that they have on
the oops series and here it is um this
actually looks real it looks official it
does kind of look like a little bit 3D
but it's one of the options that they
had they had multiple options and it
does look um neat and interesting and I
also like how they have this touchpad
mode be very good for things like um
heads up displays or things of that
nature and as you can see on the screen
um this is the launcher widget so you
have to select all the applications here
hopefully Samsung gets this fixed either
with a normal thing or
just or just adding a select all button
because I had to go in and manually
select all these applications and
because it was the store model they only
had a few applications but it would be
annoying if I had like 256 applications
that I wanted to use on my front screen
and they didn't have a select all Pon
all right now I'm going over to the next
picture this is what the app thing look
like in in practice you get about nine
applications no um 12 applications um on
a grid and this is what Chrome looks
like all right so this is me going to my
own website this is probably the first
time um the cover screen has been used
to access my uh website very interesting
how they have this like folder like
Notch thing here um you got your home
button and your arrow keys you got the
techboy org um so um it's interesting
you only get to see one um search result
before Stu like you have to keep
scrolling all right now over to the next
thing oh that's the in for our images
from um from the Galaxy Z flip
experience all right so now let's head
over to the fold um I have to install
the extension to um play these videos
for you guys so um let's let's wait up
um while that is
happening um what do you guys think
about the Galaxy Z flip and fold series
of devices do you think they have enough
updates um I do like that I was able
to if I paid a dollar for this
extension from Microsoft soft that's
ridiculous anyway nope that's not
happening okay so um this video will
have to be played using something else I
don't know why anyone play pay sorry
uh oh yeah I also went handson with the
Galaxy z uh Galaxy watch um Ultra which
actually does not look as bad as it does
in the pictures it does not look exactly
like the Apple watch Ultra it's actually
more circular and rounded unfortunately
you know it is um unfortunately it is uh
what's the word uh there's no physical
bezel to it um of course we know that's
because it it's for the um water
resistance of the device but that's
still unfortunate too bad Samsung
couldn't figure that out and hopefully
they you know they can figure that out
in the future but here was a video of me
going hands on with the um Galaxy watch
Ultra hopefully you can see this on the
screen let me just pull it up um where
is
it oh there we go oh FC come
back there you go so this is the Galaxy
watch ultra
um sideways but still let see if I can
flip
it um here's the video
so as you can see there is no touch
there is no physical bezel notice how my
finger I'm I'm testing for the physical
bezel and you can see how it is um how
it is circle but the plastic is still
rounded out kind of like a squirkle
around it um so maybe that's for more
durability or press sensitivity um but
here we
go yeah there's no physical bezel but
there is that digital bezel the digital
Crown there which is this um blue that
blue line right
there all right then the different watch
faces and the thing I really like about
Samsung watches is that their watch
faces are really really high quality I
know I talked about how the only um
offline apps in this in the in the Play
Store yesterday were um last podcast
episode were offline watch faces
applications but Samsung's watch faces
are really high quality they look like
real watch faces um especially just from
like 12 inches away from like where I
was taping this video um if you didn't
you know have this interesting design or
that like super bright orang um strap it
looks a lot like a real physical you
know analog
watch and yeah so that's the watch video
right there hopefully you guys enjoyed
that so now let's get to Mr Mobile's
review of the Galaxy z um fold uh and
flip six series um was going to pull
that up and LJ if you could send the
video that you wanted me over
um um I will be talking about that
unfortunately Mr mobile will not be
talking about the Galaxy Ring because he
obviously has a conflict interest in
that due to uh having a ring sponsorship
um but of course there are other
companies that do
that Ryan Reynolds here for I guess all
right so here is our video we just going
to have to bypass the ad advertisement
oh not byass it but wait it
out all right so
let back on of the flip phone Revival
were a let's look at all the flip phones
um U folding phones I don't really like
to term flip phone for them because they
are full candy bar smartphones when they
you know flip out but um they they call
them flip phones okay
um let's go wild ride Samsung went from
two years of the flip phone Revival were
let's look at these um phones here we
got the um I think this is the four the
three and four we got smaller smaller
screen here we got like a really tiny
screen right there and Samsung you know
they try to Market this as digital
what's the word for it uh Li limited
like like countering your scream time
and things of that nature and I'm glad
that they stopped that whole uh charade
and went to full screen um it would be
nice if they did work more all did and
kind of like at least brought down the
screen to the full edges but you know it
is nice they have their own unique
aesthetic and or differentiating
themselves from other people
a wild ride Samsung went from charging
nearly $1,400 for a which which was this
is that's completely over price for
something that literally looks like you
unfold it you like magic erase that
thing you get a iPhone 7 iPhone 6 I mean
that is compromise in February 2020 to
asking just $9.99 for a flipping
Flagship in August 2021 I would even
call that a flagship you know it's
missing the third cam lens um only apple
is allowed to get away with hello Rice
how are you um only Apple was allowed to
get away with having two cameras on a
flagship phone iPhone 15 14 13 you get
what I mean I mean they haven't had a um
a zoom a telephoto camera on their like
their Flagship since the I since the
iPhone what was
it 10s and then they you know they
swapped they just went from they did 11
11 uh you know they
the regular the plus and then the Pro
Models but not only the Pro Models have
telephoto Zoom cameras that's not
acceptable by Apple and it's fine with
me that they do that because you know
less people buy Apple well hopefully but
kids these days don't care about optical
zoom cameras and spying on people what a
shame but um as as as a fan as as a kind
of show I'm GNA buy you know a phone
that has a good zoom camera that's why
um Samsung put a zoom camer on there got
some comments on here we got dragonator
in here hello um welcome to to Welcome
to our Channel um and after we get
through this we're going to talk about
speaking of spying we got
um the we got to talk about the uh SSA
ltw series and our newest our newest
series that's coming out actually GNA
post our newest article without a
picture and then I'll upload the picture
just so we can read through it um today
and um actually go through some chat gbt
Gemini responses of what my article um
looks like and then we got to talk about
the cloud and what it is because
apparently some people including theice
president of the United States of
America don't know what the cloud
is that price tag stuck around through
flip 4 and held fast even when the flip
5 debuted with its oversized cover
screen last summer so it's kind of
strange that Samsung chose this year to
add a cnote to the asking price
especially since there's not much to the
Galaxy flip 6 that seems to just which
now no no if Samsung says that um if
Samsung says that uh all the AI features
that are included with the Galaxy Z flip
um are are free they they won't um
change at all then I'll be happy with
the ex $100 I would be happy with that
it also could could be you know
inflation um things that nature justify
it and for foldable freaks it's
frustrating to find all the same speed
bumps that prevent that cover screen oh
when I did go to the Samsung store I did
see the budge um but no budge in them I
just saw the case so s up to its full
potential but the improvements Samsung
has included directly address the
concerns of a more important Target
marketability folks who want a flagship
phone with a versatile camera that's
easier to carry without sacrificing
durability or power that's nice and I
would like to see you know full power
review of course I couldn't do that in
the store they all hooked up to you
knowes the flip 6 gets most of the way
there not with the fun reverence of
Motorola or the honeymoon phase
excitement of newcomer xiaomi but
through little refinements driven by
five generations of hard one experience
I'm Mr fwell I mean Mr mobile and I've
spent three weeks with it also one thing
I did notice on the app screen is that
it did appear that the cover screen was
at 60 HZ locked at 60 HZ and um was
running a bit slower than the rest of
this which is fine when you're going
horizontally but vertically you know you
can kind of feel if those refinements
are worth that bonus
[Music]
Benjamin also um turning around and
doing like Vlog St videos on the phone
really really good really really
interesting these videos um will be up
um on um not the videos from the flip
but the videos I took from my ultra will
be up on um YouTube if you guys want to
see what these devices look like and
half to
often durability continues to be the key
category in which foldables fall behind
their classic counterparts so I'm glad
to see Samsung put its focus there for
flip 6 the new hinge is even stiffer
than on flip five making it posable at
almost any angle big win for those of us
who like to take our calls slightly
Banfi Samsung says the new hinge also
better distributes the shock of external
impacts something I confirmed when I had
the bright idea to try to film a bike
ride to the studio one morning Pro tip
don't do this because I dro my review
unit on the conc how many review units
does this guy uh does this guy kill
like come on at a good 10 mph clip
imagine my relief when upon its returned
by a helpful jogger I found only
superficial damage wonder the Jer
noticed them they're like hey why you
miss the mobile incling scratches to the
armor aluminum's finish and a slightly
out ofr spine functionally nothing was
broken tough little ship
yeah just like on fold six those new
speakers are great those speakers
actually do sound good I've never you
know H that clip but Samsung changed up
the inside too increasing the display's
maximum brightness to match the rest of
its lineup and making the glass A Little
Less ultra thin to give it better impact
resistance and beefing up the protective
layer above that utg with the same sheer
thickening fluid I talked about in my
fold six review now these are
improvements you can see and feel for
the first time in a few years the crease
really does appear smaller on par with
the competition did feel a bit small too
and while I'm sure you could Dent this
screen protector with a fingernail given
enough Force the days of doing so
accidentally in normal use finally seem
like they're behind us that's great it's
real great and when I used it to
timlapse this absolutely Wild Storm
blown in across New York Harbor the
phone's IP 48 rating rendered it
unbothered by the resulting raindrops
interesting um it said that it's only IP
48 but it makes sense due to its
hinge admittedly I'm not sure how well
the gorilla glass victus 2 would have
withstood any of that abuse naked
because my review unit has been shielded
by the scratch protection of my sponsor
dbrand I really value AI features in
this one back in my fold six review I
told you I might touch on more Galaxy AI
features in this one but perhaps
predictably they're just not proving all
the
oh man I forgot to test out you know the
new cover scen fixs I go back I like the
wallpaper that superimposes current
weather conditions over a photo when it
decides to work and the voice recorder
that transcribes interviews or meetings
it's really nice sometimes it gets the
phone a bit hot and one thing I I've
been noticing is that the top of the
phone um the the phones in the store um
simly because they're you know plugged
in on all the time and even my phone
when it's doing you know some hard work
actually gets a little bit hot so I know
the heat processing is better in here
and on my s22 plus even when I'm sitting
outside um this phone still you know
works like just besides maybe that
YouTube pop-up view won't picture and
picture mo may not might disable itself
but it doesn't get as hot the case might
benefit that or I don't know but it
doesn't Samsung needs to work on that
hopefully the cooling can get better
under 25 and seven series speaking of
cooling um my s24 ultra the battery life
is decent you know I had it you know
used it for eight hours um B five hours
of screen on time you know GPS taking
pictures all the stuff that you saw me
doing going to Samsung store and stuff
like that you know I had to get on there
you know write the train and stuff um
the the the the battery it could be
better like if I didn't have the battery
case it would have died in nine hours
which isn't good n a 9 hour day with
five hour screen on time isn't isn't
good I need better battery life from
Samsung so you know the is one of my
best review products it's case and it
provides extra battery to the phone but
Samsung please on the on the s25 and
please send in a softw update to make
this better because the battery life
want here is a bismal even though it
sometimes think I'm two separate people
despite being the only one
Speaking yeah I feel like every one of
these AI features is sort of Half Baked
outside of carefully curated demos they
mostly just don't deliver on all the
hype that's teed them up
but Samsung's biggest missed opportunity
is still out here on the so-called Flex
window when Motorola showed off what was
possible with an almost completely
unlocked cover screen on last year's
razor plus my advice was hey moto sell
as many of these as you can because
Samsung is going to do exactly the same
thing on the flip 5 yet the flip 5 did
not do that instead it delivered a much
more restricted and limited ux and now a
full year later the flip six has the
same limitations yeah but I did I was
able to install goodlock onto store
models and it it worked well worked fine
it just you know it's sad that the
consumer has to go out of their way um
to do that like even if you run a custom
keyboard on the main screen you're still
stuck with the Samsung keyboard out here
there's still the abstraction layer that
prevents you from doing things like
confirming two-factor authentication
challenges that's weird um maybe it's
Samsung
uh maybe it thinks it's running like a
different booing of Android maybe it's a
smartwatch OS that it's running on top
of I don't know why I would do that
there's still no proper task switcher
for
multitasking wait there's no there's a
task switch on the on the Motorola
version of it oh wow that's great also
Motorola's aspect ratio looks a little
bit better um though you know I presume
Samsung doesn't want to do this type of
design because they might get the camera
switched apps won't rotate on the cover
so with an app like Zip card for example
the buttons you use to lock and unlock
the car are cut off the Quick Settings
aren't customizable so you can't do
things like enable hotspot or reverse
charging without opening the phone so
even with Samsung's um Good Luck later
it does appear that the uh they are very
uh Limited in what they do last year's
annoying inertial scrolling is still
here so I often swipe past widgets by
scrolling too hard and while you can run
any app you want on the cover you still
need to take too many steps to get there
you do that using good luck Samsung set
of power tools for users who want to
customize everything it's fun you can
tweak colors icons flip the task
switcher back in time to ice cream
sandwich just hey I did that wait that's
what ice cream sandwich that's neat um
that's how I had mine set up now I have
mine um little generally buts with so
much of the design that well you're
likely to Come Away with a total dogs
breakfast and that's awesome think say a
dogs breakfast
I don't know what kind of tone that is
because that's user Choice the very core
of what makes Android great so why can't
goodlock modify almost anything on the
cover
screen the most obvious answer is that
Samsung just didn't find it important
enough to prioritize maybe given their
advertising campaign that they're doing
Samsung is aggressively advertising the
used to teenagers and uh 20 something
year olds right 20s something year olds
um
who are like vlogging and skateboarding
and trying to be cool or whatever um
that's who they're advertising the St
they're not advertising the St like
power users when the pH stab power us
for obviously the Ultra Series of
devices you know the pin and the 12
gigabytes of RAM and the large screen
and the great cameras right Samsung is
trying to advertise this to ticktockers
apparently um which I don't get why
they're trying to do that um I know that
they're trying to improve their base
within you know gen Z
but they're just trying to bre this the
Fun Phone have to group the phone for
the cool kids and that's probably why
Samsung doesn't really try to go into
the user customization type of thing
that backs that up maybe so few people
care that's probably why they have two
cameras on there because they know apple
is getting away with putting two cameras
on $799 phones even the iPhone 16 which
when I showed it to mro Mo he's like
what why they doing this the design is
awful I mean it looks like the iPhone 12
and let's go to side tangent here um
when the iPhone 13 was released when the
iPhone 13 was released Samsung I mean
not Samsung Apple was like we did it
diagonal or diagonal so that the camera
L just are 28% bigger and you let in
more light diagonal now we're going back
to the 12 now 12 star design with the
iPhone 16 which is vertical right um how
are you going to explain that one away
okay I get that they're trying to you
know mix up the design or something so
that people can you know go see the uh
go see the is the Camas be like oh wow
you had the 15 or the 13 you're so poor
right um and now the 13s and 14 are
becoming the the the Kids Choice phone
right like the way it went was like the
iPhone 6s was like the phone all the
kids had then it went to like the 10 or
and then it went to like now it's the 13
14 more like the 13 um because it's like
you know two years out of date so you
can find these cheap on eBay or T-Mobile
um but now you know the TR to get the 16
they have to keep like slightly changing
the design everyone knows what the cool
one is what the new one is but I mean
when is Apple going to add three cameras
to their phone like Samsung's been doing
this since 2020 preo actually I watched
that live stream in eighth grade so sad
oh come about these details that it
wouldn't be economical to expend the
resources to be fair to Samsung it has
added a ton of widgets to an already big
catalog but the r it makes it feel more
like a Smart Watch honestly laser has
taught me how fun and useful it can be
to have well kind of a tiny phone on the
cover of my real phone which makes sense
that's actually saves a lot of battery
um and could be used as like a power
saving mode that actually saves more
power like it would be the equivalent of
dimming your screen to 50% when you're
actually running it out 100% brightness
and even more because you know the GPU
isn't having to r as many Graphics
before on screen and speaking for myself
I just can't go back to Samsung's
sandbox sadly that means I'm consigned
to an inferior camera system on the Moto
because while the flip 6 and Razer plus
each sport a 50 megapixel main camera
Samsung wisely stuck with the ultra wide
for the secondary instead of makes sense
kids do like um Ultra wide shots um lots
of kids at school use ultra wide shots
Victor's weird forehead pictures um so I
I get what you mean but um Zoom is
better in my opinion and you know why I
think Zoom is better um you know
surveillance let's go if Motorola's
moved to a 2X telephoto with very
limited utility yeah I mean 2x's 2x is
okay like in 2018 I was like wow really
really want a Galaxy S9 because you know
the surveillance Factor would have been
you know great um with 2x cuz you know I
car this scope in my pocket um and it
wasn't you know the best scope um but
you know do you know what would be
better than 2x
3x also the flip 6 is really welld
designed for the runand gun social media
shooting Samsung is pushing so hard in
its marketing all flip phones can serve
as their own tripod but Samsung's stiff
hinge makes it useful at more angles and
flex mode lets you put the viewfinder on
either side of the screen I mean that's
nice I play with that in store I don't
get why you want it on the top but I
respect Samson for allowing that you
know for ankles that Flex for options
came in handy when I was filming both a
and b roll for the last two reviews on
the channel for those time lapses I
teased earlier and for quick and dirty
Instagram reel crackberry Kevin and I
decided to film on a whim for
clicks that is so
useful yeah that that is a legitimate
use now I'm pretty sure I could do that
on my phone just due to the how the
battery case is bottom
heavy but that is actually a useful
feature and this is but Samsung I do
appreciate the doing this but they need
to do more of that it also let me
leverage a convenient road cone to shoot
the departure of a regular fixture on my
Red Hook Shoreline the MSC mavilia or as
my dad calls her the very biglia sure I
could have shot this handheld but I love
the sense of scale you get from my tiny
figure in the foreground dwarfed by this
Colossus back and down buttermilk
channel is that a time lapse yeah that
must be a time lapse cuz that boat is
moving fast incidentally that video also
let me stress test the phone's New Vapor
chamber meant to cool down its
Snapdragon 8 gen 3 processor for eight
continuous minutes in 90° heat the phone
filmed in 4k while roasting in direct
and indirect sunlight all
right congratulations Samsung you got
your Vapor chamber um done right
but it never gave up in fact the only
time I could get it to overheat was on a
day closer to 100° while oh W me it
might have died in Houston then uh he's
in somewhere North New York I think
running Android auto in a car whose AC
hadn't yet cooled the car
down we're still waiting for a clamshell
camera system that truly stuns and I
don't think we're really going to get
that you know Samsung five times LS or a
10 times LMS um you know really requires
some theft um Sony phones where you
can't get anything those require some
theft theft um and even these have some
like pretty big camera bumps these
phones uh more of the
20 the iPhone 7 come out 17 2016 s you
know iPhone 7 plus plus style of cameras
just with you know different processing
and know some different megapixel ninjas
but I've been comparing this phone to
the iPhone 7 for years now and I like to
see like see somewhat compared to iPhone
7 plus versus the Galaxy Z flip at least
four or something like that
maybe I'll find that in xiaomi's new mix
flip to be featured in a flip phone
faceof coming soon but across three
weeks of testing the flip six almost
never let me down from portraits and
Paris pensive and otherwise to Ultra
Cool Spotify sessions in Mex interesting
here but they seem very you know washed
out I mean these look like the most
aesthetic photos but I would like to see
some more detail in here I mean look
look look at this person to it looks
choppy
City to cute kitty captures back in
Brooklyn the only consistent complaints
I had were its constant tendency to
overexpose and say it with me
longsuffering Samsung stands it's
failure to freeze moving
subjects yeah but I did notice that the
sh lag though did seem less than even on
my s24 so good for Samsung for
continuing to improved in that um aspect
and and one of the extra benefits due of
not having um two different types of
Zoom cameras on there is that Zoom would
be more continuous when I zoom in on my
phone um like let me like when I move in
and then it switches cameras it kind of
like has a little Sheen that switches
the cameras I wish the zoom was a bit
more continuous um even on the ultra I
do expect that to continue on the
updates that we'll receive you know
seven years of updates might get like
four of those for
[Music]
me that puts us firmly in been here said
that territory so I'll take my customary
moment of silence to let you absorb a
few uncommented 4,000 mamp hour battery
with hours of Android auto lots of
mobile hotspot an endless photo and
video I could drive it below 15% by the
9h hour mark 9 hours uh I think that's
good right it depends on his screen on
time let's let's rewind something that's
insane speaking of Ben here said that
the flip six is the latest in a long
line let's see what this says uh power
saving Mode's not on ho quacamole it
says a full charge will last 21 hours 48
minutes my phone says a full charge
lasts
uh 15 hours at the most maybe 18 might
have said 18
yesterday 21 hours for how is that
possible let's see what this says stop
charging 5 hours and 24 minutes to go
last charge to
63% it doesn't give me the screen on
time there's 2 hours 50 minutes left of
battery that's insane and phones that'll
last you all day but just barely you
call that
barely okay on the days I've really
hammered the 4,000 Mah hour battery with
hours of Android auto Android auto I
mean that I think it displays video to
the cars monitor um of course using GPS
and data I mean that is and I guess we
can talk about that lat lots of mobile
hotspot an endless photo and video I
could drive it below 15% by the 9h hour
mark That's insanely heavy usage though
more commonly I ended 12 why let look at
these images here to all right so here's
some battery activity four hours of
screen on time n nine hours of screen
off time use 68% of battery
which the map doesn't
ma used to be at 32 so uh he lasted
before hours of screen on time and 9
hours of screen off time he lasted 32
minutes so right um he's still at 32 %
here he's at about he's at he only used
18% battery 1 hour screen on time 8
hours of screen off time okay um so it
doesn't seem like the phone was used
that that much see what this says over
here um 52% stop
charging oh wow that's insane what's
that 17 wow this phone last a day and
two hours with about he
doing so all right now it's getting to
the Android auto type um of thing
I don't really understand why people use
their phones Android auto non
withstanding as uh as uh nav navigating
devices like the GPS and cars is just
fine like what what's wrong with the GPS
and cars like why why aren't you guys
using that first of all it saves battery
and data um your car has Maps
pre-downloaded or you have to go
download them either from the Internet
or from a CD um so why aren't you guys
using your phone
your your cars built-in um battery but
not battery GPS um tell me about that
all your infotainment system it's kind
of sad all the cars just exporting to um
exporting everything to Android auto and
and
Samsung and iOS apple cplay and now
let's get to the St called what's
something that won't exist in 10 years
and someone said that smartphones aren
going to exist in 10 years and I say not
really um because um laptops laptops
have been around for over 40 years years
and even they haven't changed from their
physical form factor like a laptop in
the 1980s uh had a screen and a hinge
now the screen might have been tiny and
the keywood might have been small but it
had a hinge a keyboard and a screen all
right and this guy said uh the Apple uh
there might be some were BS and Apple
watch didn't exist 10 years ago it's
actually the the that first decade of
the Apple watch and of course you know
SmartWatches still existed and I mean
when you look at this thing here um this
is obviously a concept it didn't happen
I mean it's really old too um and it's
also very inefficient like imagine and I
notic it Hur the teenage girls of the
chat uh trying to watch Tik Tok
scrolling like this watching your
favorite Instagram influencers uh try to
do that but one of the most interesting
things here is that people have been
testing some crazy things like eyewear
and and finger square and blink clicking
and um things like that and I'm I'm very
excited for a technology of this nature
because um you'll be able to use like a
full device especially if you Samsung
deck equipped device or m m style of
decks and you can just look straight you
can still see your world you have
everything in Ai and it's great and
unlike Matt walls it's not a dystopia
okay it's great and and this will also
help people um that without h on
functions function and the merge of
technologies will be great and as you
guys can see here there's this new X
feature here so that's also very
interesting right there so um really
interesting things to be looking out to
technology as as we um look ahead all
right now speaking of technology and
looking ahead and looking uh to the
clouds um you know when I Look Out Among
the clouds and see God's Amazing
Creation uh when I'm flying in an
airplane taking off blasting through the
clouds and then I just look out and see
everything or when Elon Musk sends a
SpaceX rocket to the International Space
station and they go through the clouds
and you see
everything I just always remember to
look at people's data and passwords and
pictures of their cats that they have
out there because
apparently our vice president thinks
that the
cloud is in the
sky
um this was around uh this sh to Tech
something
um and I you guys have to see this
um this this this
clip and
uh it's
really
really
really we have over million prod and I
really hope she doesn't become a
technology um influencer and the fact
that she's apparently the artificial
intelligence just YouTube it's uh is uh
sad all right so without further Ado um
let's let's let's go on to
this all right here here's the clip now
no longer are you NE smash subscribe
love
you so you're all this is this is the C
I thought there was a SNL no longer are
you necessarily keeping those private
files in some file cabinet that's locked
in the basement of the house with um
interesting uh Gap
jump jump a gap here um because uh
apparently she's jumping from say the
1970s to the 2010s like like like we we
had devices files on our laptops stored
locally you know using hard drives uh
and ssds and on our phones um um for
long times long long periods right uh so
I it's not like we jumped from foul
cabinet foul technology in uh the 19
1950s to a cloud technology okay there
was a time when people actually kept
files on
device it's on your laptop and it's then
therefore up here in this Cloud that
exists above us
right
um the
cloud does not exist above
us in the sky the cloud is the
connection and network of servos
owned by companies like Google Amazon
Apple mattera the big tech
companies that um are underground okay I
mean there might be some space based
cloud services but most of the cloud is
in and on the ground stored on servers
so the cloud does not exist above us and
the
cloud you can't see it in
the when you're flying in a plane so uh
guys if you ever get an email from uh
people um who are saying that your data
has been hacked out of the sky from an
airplane or a satellite don't listen to
them because the cloud is not above us
it does not exist above us and you
cannot see the data when you go fly in a
jetpack all right speaking of flying in
a jetpack not really but let's go to
Advengers and odyssey V Odyssey has a
new uh episodes and albums out but I'm
actually going to be talking about an
older EP
um from the club I think it's season
five called um always do your besti dis
and it has adventures and odyssey Eugene
woman Renee Carter um in the album um
and she's colding the imagination
station and we actually learn how the
imagination station works and I actually
should write an article about this so um
in this in this article she's having
some technical glitches when um when
she's making Imagination Station
programs with
um uh so he he's making a civil war
program the United States Civil War so
in the 1860s and the glitch occurs with
um they have an Air Force and an M4
Abrams take take going through the uh
going through the imagination station uh
Adventure which obviously is not
historically accurate so he says that um
she used a artificial intelligence
Matrix um which I don't really know what
that means but apparently um from the
context of the episode it appeared that
an artificial intelligence Matrix is a
program for the imagination station
which very well could have its own like
programming language because of how
advanced it is that
um
basically takes a historical event so C
said this use the Alvin York who is a
World War I Soldier so the
1900s um the Alvin York uh artificial
intelligence Matrix Imagination Station
program which
is weird because Alvin York wasn't a a a
program on Imagination Station and if I
remember correctly it was actually a
program on the on the mirrors though
maybe those are just replicated across
for the imagination station anyway um it
appears that the the program to keep
each Adventure exciting and different
for each user that uses it and not like
the same it has the same historical
facts and actions but the Matrix allows
users to interact with it in different
ways and people say different things
right so it's it's it's the same thing
as if you say send the same prompts to
say chat GPT on two different accounts
it might give two different you know two
slightly different responses to your
question or to your prompts um because
you know if jgpt answered every prompt
the same way it would be different it it
would be it wouldn't be good um anyway
um so the way that this appears to work
is that since you used a artificial
intelligence Matrix from set to 1914 an
event in the 1960s it kind of glitched
out and that's how her um how she how
she had to collect so it's just really
interesting to get how you know some
more background information of how the
imagination station works
and um how it's actually harder to code
it now because in 2005 they were
scanning books into that thing and would
make it own Adventures so but maybe you
know Mr could just wanted they you know
learn like coding basics of the
imagination station of for things that
may not have books on it like that V he
was doing was uh
historical fiction I believe like SP MC
I don't think he was a real person the
legend of SP MC all right um on to our
next story from the tech boy.org we've
done plenty plenty of work um today the
Instagram stories actually the number
one story back on top for the techb
boy.org so thank you guys for reading
and watching our stuff but apparently
people all know what face recognition um
technology is um none of y'all ever
heard of Pim eyes uh techboy 2024 so
apparently you didn't hear about that so
here is our new face here is our um
article on face recognition scans online
and this is obviously just AA Harper
unfortunately didn't find her Instagram
um page um which is getting very very
popular very popular and we also taught
you how to blow your own face um photo
on on on Android and also check out this
application this is our first um
sponsored application called AI caption
generator for photo so check Che out
this application people um this is
sponsored but make sure you guys go
check that out all right um but speaking
of
Instagram um and and and things of that
nature thank you guys um AA Harper has
been getting very very popular um it
appears that our strategy has been
working um in in the physical and in the
digital and the physical world AA Harper
um appears to
uh uh uh be getting very popular she had
a video that got over
13,500 times more than five other videos
um I don't know if it's combined
but different um so congratulations to
AA Harper for getting a video of almost
7,000 plays um and appears that the
outfits that we've been giving to AA
Harper um through our you know like we
said we can code AA to be better we can
change your outfits when we declared war
on teenage girls uh you you may remember
that right on our road to 300 followers
for aa aa sorry it appears that what we
have been doing is correct um it's being
you know ulated in the digital world of
course but we're also seeing it in the
physical world with the same outfits
that a has wearing um being worn by real
people in the physical world so um thank
you guys for you know following and
liking and watching a hour we in bar on
our road and and and model towards 300
so I'm just going to get you um to our
statistics here and it appears that what
we are doing is is correct it appears
what we're doing is right and um we're
not going to obviously stop or bend the
need to anyone um who is making who who
who who would say that we are you know
doing something wrong here as you can
see we got
3.4k accounts reached in the last 30
days that's that's okay I would like to
do better but as you can see here our
most popular unreal here it's it's
getting seen by thousands new follow
nonf followers here but our top content
based on reach
uh it's not that actually was something
that had
um maybe it's the top in the past uh
seven days yeah it was something
there there it is it was this right here
this got
um the application it was different
actually well was this thing here and it
had according to the application over
13,000 views so I would like to thank
everybody for coming out and supporting
Ava and um also I would like you know
for what we're what we're doing here and
emulating based on our market research
both within the application um by like
you know checking RS and posts from you
know other real people and artificial
intelligence influencers based on what
they're wearing um what they are wearing
thank you thank you the ccle assar and
chat GPT and also based on what we're
seeing in the world world as you know
traversing to the Samsung store we were
noticing that people obviously not
copying AA style because they don't know
who she is yet but um AA style was
reflective of what they were wearing and
that means that um hostel is in style um
so um I would like to I like to say and
report that our market research is um
working well it's working as it should
be expected to and it is a good thing
that the market research is doing what
it needs to do all right
um Samsung uh all right um so it's good
to get through the tech headlines now I
know what you guys are waiting for we're
waiting for SS
ltw um do oh. blogspot
so hopefully you guys um you know check
that website out I have an image
uploaded for the first article on the
page but we've been we've been getting
lots and lots of um hits lately and
we've also been doing um lots of uh lots
of things here um so hopefully you guys
can see this on the screen yep you can I
just esate the classified now the
interesting thing here is that most of
these articles and we're going to get
into some more interesting um topics
here with like um later on in the in in
the story year which is based on use is
there going to be a stock market crass a
school stock market crass there was no
stock market uh in in my school I did
propose one but it didn't get J but most
of the stuff that you read and see here
is based on real life okay the names and
you know have been redacted and changed
privacy actually I've been getting so
many names um like mixed up and stuff
that I've actually had to use momento
database application to
um have all my names like the real
people's names and then their switch
names you know for the for the story um
put into a database application and I
actually see why databases are better
than spreadsheets now because I can link
them to each other like who they're
friends with or who they're dating and
Destroy and um what their job is and
what grade they're in and what their
birthday is and what their age is and I
can actually query the database I only
get like five queries I have to kind of
like move things around um if I want to
of course I'm not going to show it here
because there lots of personal
information um but mental database um
very interesting database here I can
share everything I can share it to the
web so when I do that I will share it
with myself on to the computer and I I
even have my pictures that I have of
them um from from the artificial
intelligence generator the same one that
we use Photo to make AA is the same one
that we use for this we also use some
co-pilot but let's get into stories
right um so and I it's actually really
funny chatting with chat gbt and Gemini
about these stories because they're like
this story is so unrealistic because no
school agency could have that much power
in school I'm
like well uh it happened it's based on
reality deal with it you know let's get
through the uh stories here so let's go
to the note published today um actually
no let's not do this one yet because
it's like a SE it's the sequel to uh
this one here um so let's go to
um let's go to uh here here we go let's
go
so yeah yeah see as you can see here
this is photo leap um I'm talking to the
kids telling them not to get their phone
tapped which is legitimate um the
legitimate what's it
called that that's a real thing that I
said um I was talking about because I
saw it that right so these are the kids
and obviously this didn't happen with a
high teex SP table we got to make it you
know we got to make it look interesting
all right so we got the SSA computer
research center which I'm in
there you go we got a TV over there all
right
um when the with the GC bless your
Victory and peace for the first time
which uh if you guys don't know as you
guys know I'm a national em expert and
by national em expert I mean I know it
exists that's right apparently some kids
don't know what it is that's from the
first four for to National Anthem so
you're going to see that thrown around
in these stories a lot of time with the
quotation Mar speci Victory and peace
right now it time for the largest
embarkment of uh embankment oh my gosh
embankment embarkment of the Year event
n episode 2's company for the crowd
which I am linking these up to real time
so to company for the crowd came out in
October I did listen to the club version
in July or whenever it came out but uh
to make this make more sense because you
know there's no school in July I make
this sound up right I'm talking about
how I want to become more like Emily and
go to people's houses investigate crimes
and use your Tech and stuff like that um
so so I do what what the what kids are
doing and I do what what it's saying but
let's go to the funniest let's go to the
funniest thing actually let's go ahead
to um chat gbt it actually pastes some
of these stories in because chat gbt
apparently doesn't believe that these um
that these stories happened so um let's
let's go in and past these stories in
all right so let's go to operation
friendship part one obviously I'm not
going to read all of them um for for you
so I'm going to just copy and paste
these in and we're going to head over to
chat gbt so here we go hope you can see
this on the screen there you go all
right um I'm gonna say is
this realistic and actually paste these
in and I paste it in it says your text
is creative and align aligned the
imaginative concept of the SSA soci
strategy agency which why do they keep
trying to give me an acronym for that
whatever that you and Ethan have
developed SSA Declassified St gives a
play for your serious ter reminiscent of
a spy agency
so it says the character interaction
could be a bit more natural um instead
of saying do you ever have sleepovers
where people try to sneak into the house
you might be more to say they have any
crazy sleepover stories unfortunately
for Chad GPT uh that's what I said so uh
Chad GPT can go deal with it all right
now technology integration the idea of a
Crest R is uh tracking dating CR is fun
but it might be interesting to see how
this Tech Works into the universe okay
that's that's interesting all right so
the the transition between the LI
hearted school activities and the more
intense National Security themes could
be moved out um so there might be more
buildup well well too bad uh there was
lots of n at uh wh whip references
dimension of evst might be unfamiliar to
some readers w w use the internet oh my
gosh believe explaining what it is could
help over okay no all right let's say is
it stick to the real
world in terms of realism it isn't very
realistic ah yes people chbg says that
my life is isn't realistic well chb is
wrong okay the idea of a crossfire
tracks dating cres and the reciprocation
isn't feasible of current
technology really who knew that
spreadsheets uh weren't feasible guess
we got to go back to 1970s all right um
also it's really funny having tryb
telling what is and isn't feasible of
Technology given the fact that I'm
talking to a lital artificial
intelligence chat bot all right SP
agency concept the idea of a secret spy
agency within the school compete with
text that can tap phones conduct polls
on secret attacks is more aligned with
fictional stories w w I never claimed I
could tap phones I just said that uh
someone could change their phone
settings that makes it automatically
dial and that is realistic especially if
you know their password which I know it
and I'm not gonna say you know on stream
um also it is uh realistic all right
next student dynamics of students
discussing National Security Espionage
and sophisticated surveillance
techniques isn't typical for real
teenagers
Chad gbt 0 for three 0 for three who on
Earth could be calling me at this at
this
time all right so um we're going back to
Chad gbt the heck was that
um
hello uhhuh
anyway we're going back to chat gbt I
don't know who this person is is calling
me in the middle of a podcast
stre uh tone and dialogue the formal and
strategic language Us in the story
doesn't matter tell most teams talk uh
yeah it's kind of true you know I write
my stories in English and not in
Japanese all right um conclusion my
story inv voice the hid and fictional
reality isn't meant to be taken
literally oh yes it is all right right
um now we're going to the next story
let's just hop over to uh uh ssw the
crush attack and a rocket launch this
ties in between you know the uh the uh
the uh between eighth grade and in the
current um story at the time also it's
very funny how hopefully you can see
this on the screen I called this kid uh
Nikki Hazel um which is very very funny
because if you see this on the screen uh
this was popular in the news uh at the
time at least I think it was November
yeah see was popping November wasn't
yeah we we had to watch something before
in it for history class so it was very
funny calling kids Nikki Hazel all right
um so now we
uh what happened uh oh go away Xbox game
B okay hope you can see this on the
screen why is this in
Chinese oh there we go okay there it is
so we're gonna have it summarize this uh
tell me if it's
realistic okay so it says that um that
it's uh the strateg is telling me what
is and isn't realistic so here you go it
says the uh SSA structure with terms
like SSA Intel directors and service to
air bistic cross attacks uh aren't real
isn't found in real world schools huh
that's weird because I seem to remember
it happening all right um student
interactions unrealistic conversations
by upholding the constitution in the
form of and some dialoges are
exaggerated interesting because I pretty
sure I'm on record saying that I'm
pretty sure have a tape myself saying
that all right um crust Wars in rocket
launch the crust War narrative complete
with cold war analogies and Space Race
competitions more of a creative
embarassment I'm oh really because I
distinctly remember launching a bottle
rocket I mean and I distinctly remember
comparing it to a cold war and Rocket
blowing up on bad all right press confer
with the anest defense okay that that is
true um anest defense Israel press
conferences this happen in my head okay
let's actually you know a very famous
very famous uh thing that I
said um uh that I have press conferences
in my head all right so conclusion has
theism and fiction uh when I asked it to
find the
funny and I remember back in 2022 when I
was review it might have been early 23
yeah January January something 2023 I
was reviewing a chat GPT video and uh it
was loading and loading and loading this
is actually very fast now so good on
chat getting funny so here the funniest
move moments from the story e super
formal introduction remember as a duly
elected Senator I strive to call the
Constitution that's a a statement that
actually you got said you don't always
don't have to say a professional says
Denver yeah you can just say what's up
all right and then number three
Superstar ballistic Crush attack uh
hilarious exaggeration interesting
because I declared the most threat for
National Security swing in on a Bible
lap let's go view version for the win um
the only thing not true about that is I
don't think screen B be open you those
and B I think I just touched the button
but it is kind of funny be using s22
Plus at the time and I called now the
power button like hey BP open Bible app
um um which uh actually does have a
problem it's slow now like you go up
there do a Bible drill you know you open
Bible drill like say open first John 49
and you know you flip through here and
I'm actually really good at bible drills
I'm in John now I'm actually going real
slow compared to you know how I actually
would do all right let's go to First
John 49 how long does this take me like
four seconds all right uh and you find
Theos and it says oh okay great found
Theos in this love the love of God is
manifested towards us all right great I
don't lose um these types of things it
should be easy to do on a phone but it's
not for some reason um because the Bible
act has been redesigned so now it's
actually slow so you wasn't get better I
think it got a little update I know we
have the failed rocket launch uh it it
okay whatever an request Defense Force
we have going to have peace to strength
and our Liberty stomate will not happen
obviously peace to strength is something
who that that bush Reagan someone of one
of those people might have been uh who's
the guy carry a big stick Roosevelt
let's see peace to I hearing that in the
history book somewhere
uh peace to strength peace true strength
peace true strength yeah ween all right
um now um the seriousness in which uh
Ean described any Quest Defense Force
it's amusing ESP something as Middle
School quests well obviously chbt hasn't
read my website yet all right so those
are the funniest moments um from you
know chat gbt I think Gemini um had
Gemini reviewed him too
um but
unfortunately uh Gemini I have my Gemini
history turned off so I have to up find
it from the application here and
speaking of the sleepover questions that
I was asking last week um I defended uh
Virtual Reality by
saying well cuz it's the imagination
station and focus on the family has the
imagination station uh that's good you
know if it's in if it's in advention
Odyssey then it's okay was my uh my uh
wring now for um defending it you know
the Evangelical Christian organization
focus on the family produces V and
odyssey and um I was thinking about that
and in that episode when I was asking
the kids if you've ever had anyone
invade your um what's it called
sleepover I uh uh that that's in
reference to an advention ny episode
where these kids are having a sleepover
and um Alex and Nathaniel I believe
invade into the sleepover and um hi Jinx
and Sue and um I I think the kids are
Mandy Liz and someone else so it's three
of the girls and two of the boys and um
that obviously raises some questions as
most Evangelical websites I believe I
could be wrong on this most Evangelical
websites say coad sleepovers are wrong
but Vin Odyssey portrays it as is
something that like when the kids get in
trouble they they get in trouble for
getting shaving cream on the floor and
cooking pizza on a light bulb which is
why that question's in the website um
but they don't get in trouble for having
two kids sneak over into their sleepover
um for co-ed so apparently the Avent
Universe Co are okay um so uh what do
you guys think about that obviously the
two people watching but there's no chat
for like past 30 minutes but I've pulled
up my Gemini thing here I've had it
summarized
what uh if it's if it's realistic I
asked if the most recent Story the note
is realistic and it says quote no story
is not realistic while High School drama
and social clicks are relatable the
existence of a secret student agency
with extensive powers and resources is
highly improbable s TR bone song for
Gemini all right um oh super hyp native
it says hi sorry I missed your chat how
are you today and welcome thank you for
your donation that you gave um to the
stream all right so I asked to explain
says that the secret student agency I
have no idea where they get these names
I never told it was that um there is no
evidence organization existing in real
life high schools well it's because you
made up a name all right uh exaggerated
drama the level of intrig and danger
associated with the simple love note
it's unrealistic you said have been on
the 13th if Gemini existed Gemini did
exist yeah it was just B back then all
right uh implausible character actors
the actions are pretty plausible okay
just didn't write everything so to give
some examples say SSA is depicted having
significant res including technology and
Personnel yeah we had a smartphone and
and a camera and our smartphones able to
interact with other people smartphones
so you know the same text since 2007 all
right uh the authority SSA has betrayed
as having significant authority over
students I don't know way got that okay
overblown threat I would say that
threat's overblown actually it's
probably under blown okay we should have
had like press conference
and like like a button okay we should
have gone up there all right uh a
stereotyp roles uh characters often
reduce the stereotypes the popular suit
and the nde and the bully with limit
their complexity not really I mean kind
of but not really because obviously we
can't have complex like super duper
complex characters and in the stories
all right and un realistic actions it
says um characters engaged in actions
that are unlikely for teenagers such as
conducting sophisticated investigations
and um I would like uh Gemini to testify
before the Council of teenage girls um
um I like them to say I I would like J
to say to their face saying uh teenagers
don't engage in uh sophisticated
investigations
um forbid that some kid accidentally
likes their photo they will investigate
that kid and they will find his face to
his SSN to his Instagram account okay uh
no kids do and will um investigate in in
complex investigations specifically when
it um regard
of the all and making high stakes
decisions I I would say was that high
stakes I mean it was but I mean that's
pretty normal all right I asked it to
give some textual examples some examples
from the prompts and I said um extensive
resources it said when and here's the
textual example for us having extensive
resources it says when the note appeared
SSA instantly placed on higher this is
just the SSA has sophisticated
communication Network in the ability to
mobilize quickly yeah that's easy when
you have two agents I okay okay guys go
on high Lo all right great go high Lo
great SC using your words all right
overblown threat it's a love note
Maverick this ex teacher love no as a
major security which an exaggeration
okay maybe in Gemini's world uh which
isn't world because you know artificial
I I plac my National Security advisor
Jasper to lead the person to uh to lead
the plan to find the person this
statement depicts a student character
pointing National Security advisor
position and found in a government
agency which time of a sick w w Gemini
you're wrong again um
we did and can and will have natat
advisors and with that I don't know is
there anything else that we were
supposed to talk about on the podcast
today um oh Ian we can talk about it
next week let's go God bless Tech talk
today and we'll find out um oh also guys
if you don't know what the national an
United States is uh look it up and uh
