<h1>THETECHBOY Tech News and Reviews is live! 52524 Podcast PT 2</h1>
<pre>boy podcast it's going to be a short
episode today because we're take from
mobile anyway
um oh anyway um I guess I want to talk
about being Tech positive um right now
so an article came out um talking about
Microsoft's new AI powered personal
computers and it was um talking about
the new feature that allows you to go
back in time
via screenshots and then AI on device we
analyze them and help you go find so
it's like a web it's like a history for
your computer um the people over at ntp
were upset about that because they were
scared that it that Microsoft was going
to be able to search through your
computer and scan it or whatever
messages have beened
that
people people may be
concerned um if you're concerned about
fentic investigators going in and
scanning through that that's a fair
point however um most of the stuff you
do on a computer independently already
has a history associated with it for
years of use for instance your web
browser already has history um on it and
that's what most people do on their
computer anyway um Event Viewer you can
kind of see the history at least on
Windows devices there you probably won't
see some
screenshots um
[Music]
um yeah so it's a feature that probably
have turned on but always makes you to
wipe at the end of the day or maybe only
have turned on and I'm accessing
sensitive information like passwords and
um stuff like that but I can understand
the thing but the thing is we have to be
more Tech positive and I automatically
assume the worst now speak speaking of
assuming the worst people were to Tech
positive about the rabbit R1 um or
artificial intelligence device but
coffeezilla and and inv like a human and
not like a human but just hard could it
to specific websites so cater comes up
then that's a problem also he uncovered
that some he founder had some crypto
scam going on and before he found it
rabbit all one um I think that's all
we're going to talk about for now that's
all for now we'll go get back to more
scam and being Tech positive and my
Galaxy s24 Ultra which finally came in
and we'll get to all on Monday uh God
bless and Tech talk to you later</pre>
