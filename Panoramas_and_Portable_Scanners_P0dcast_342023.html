<h1>Panoramas and Portable Scanners P0dcast 342023</h1>
<pre>I almost forgot special sign up the
podcast listening Diego
hello and welcome to the this week in
the techboard podcast hope you enjoyed
the new music we have here from this
software and I'm going to be talking
about panorama so we're doing video
editing or photo editing application
um on your phone that you can use that's
application subscribe and next week we
will be talking about how you can
um take one of those horizontal visuals
or edit windows on your Samsung phone so
let's get to today's headlines
all right so here's the website
um Sarah this we're going to be talking
about how you can track Wi-Fi with your
Samsung phone and as you can see here I
did my own little photo edit of a
um
sorry what you call it horizontal and
that will be coming out soon so as you
can see here I can track my own Wi-Fi
from I was at school so you can see that
anyway
um the closer to the number the closer
to the hotspot are and there's a Reload
screen right there and you keep going
right there and the closer you get to
the hot spot the closer you get to
Samsung has its own built-in Wi-Fi uh
radar in there so first you have to open
the settings application you scroll down
click inside of that Wi-Fi click uh take
a sec seven times if you come into
developer and click the Wi-Fi developer
settings it says nearby Wi-Fi and you'll
see the radar screen just read it reload
all right and you'll be able to track
Wi-Fi any any Wi-Fi even Wi-Fi that
you're not connected to which is
interesting so I could theoretically
find all the Wi-Fi how to put it around
me in my neighborhood all right
um You can also remove bitternesses from
yourself from a Samsung phone Dex on PC
is great but you might want to check it
out first and then how to take a
panorama on a Samsung phone the title
was added I'll check them into Japan
remember is 360 degree image that
switched together in one long image of
course you open your camera application
that's worked to the text it says more
than you Clips so you get the icon that
says Panorama and move the phone around
like so
all right so you may be wondering well
why can't you just take a standard wide
angle shot and the answer is wide angle
so I just do not capture as much as
panoramas do a panorama only capture the
captions
around outside well a wide angle shot
man would be able to capture a limited
amount of degrees
um
and so that is why panoramas are very
useful in
but panorama's do have disadvantages and
that is that for some reason I don't
think it captures as high as a
um what's it called megapixel and
resolution as regular photos do because
they don't come out as high quality as I
would like to
um
so I'm going to show you guys
live on video how you can get a panorama
so I have my phone here let me just turn
off this
stuff there you go
I want to show you guys on video how to
get a panorama
um on your Samsung phone and it's
probably most likely the same on all
worlds
and uh and then also next week I will be
talking about oh that's definitely gonna
write about
um how to
oh
you can um
use Photo remastering which will
automatically edit your photo
so here we go
all right that's my phone screen
okay all you have to do is click the
camera application
then click
panorama on Samsung phones you can
choose between white chicks or point
five times and one times
Samsung phone
all right so we have about 20 more
seconds at the stream if we make this a
five minute stream so
does anyone have any questions comments
or other things
um please send us some ideas over email
about what we should talk about next on
the YouTube channel and on the website
God bless and Tech talk to you later</pre>
