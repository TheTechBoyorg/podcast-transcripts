<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 5325</h1>
<pre>Everybody and welcome to the This Week
in the Tech Boy podcast. We have tons
tons of news to get to today. So much
information that I have to get out there
about you. I mean, I have an entire list
um going on about here. So, this is
speedun speedrun test. This might be one
two hours long. So, let's get into
today's uh first topic. Google Google is
uh with the United is being sued by the
Department of Justice again and they put
in an update on their case and uh it's
ridiculous. It's absolutely ridiculous.
not from Google. Google is good. Google
is great. Um but from the United States
Department of Justice. And here is the
latest thing from uh from Google. Um
quote, uh "Bing is so bad." This is this
is my uh instant reaction to it. Bing is
so bad that they need Google to run ads
for them. Yes. According to what the uh
official news from Google account uh
says, uh you can see this, right? Yes.
Okay. According to this news story,
uh we heard from a witness in the
government whose big idea it is to make
Google run a national ad campaign
encouraging people to use being and
other search engines. Yeah, being is so
pathetic. Bing is so bad that they need
to have Google run ads for them so that
they don't
uh so so that so that it doesn't work
out for them. H how does that even
remotely make sense? Why should Google
have to pay money to run ads to
encourage people to use the someone
else's search engine? Could you imagine
if Ford was forced to run ads for Chevy?
Like if Bing is good, people will use
it. In fact, switching your browser is
so easy on Windows. Think about it.
Chrome OS is the like two or three
desktop operating system in the world.
And that may sound great except you
realize it has about 12% of the um
desktop market. The number one desktop
operating system is Microsoft Windows.
Microsoft Windows has been around years
and years longer than Google even was
invented. They had all this time to
create a good search engine. They had
all this time to integrate it with their
own product. Heck, all um Windows
computers come pre-built in with Edge
with being built in. And yet the number
one search on Bing of all time is going
to be how to um download Chrome. And yet
again, I'm going to open up Edge right
here, and I'm going to show you the
difference between Edge and Chrome. This
is the default browser here. And I'm not
saying or calling for any Department of
Justice action against Microsoft. I'm
just saying, let's be fair um here,
okay? I'm not really a fan of um
uh Department of Justice actions towards
many companies, antitrust lawsuits. I
think they're ridiculous and stupid. But
hopefully you guys can see this on the
screen. I'm gonna have to switch. All
right. Yeah. So, this is Microsoft Edge.
Okay. And I'm going to type in Google in
into here. So, let me just uh open it
up. All right. So, I've typed in Google.
And as you can see on the screen, this
is what Microsoft Edge shows you. When
you type in Google, just into the Bing
search bar, no settings have been
changed or anything. It's telling you,
begging you to use Microsoft being right
here. Every search brings you close to a
free donation for over two million
nonprofits. Bring to use Microsoft
Being. Microsoft literally has to beg
you. They have to use the plight of dead
children. They have to use the plight of
these poor people here. Uh, you know,
this poor disabled man, this poor dog
here, this this poor man holding up his
phone here. They have to use the plight
of these poor people to force you to try
to use [ __ ] Just just like um Eosia.
Eosia has to use a bunch of like, oh, we
plant a tree for every web search that
you do. Yeah. The only reason you can do
that is because like three people and
the CEO uses Aosia, which is still based
off of Microsoft's Bing. Okay. Do you
know why that no one wants to use Bing?
Do you know why no one wants to use
Edge? It's not because this is not being
forced on them. It's not because they
don't have the option. It's not because
they um have no choice. It's because
it's
trash. It's trash. I mean, here it is. I
typed in Chrome. This is the Microsoft
Edge
experience. Is it going to come
up? See, see Microsoft Edge once again.
What? Like, what's wrong with
you? Well, for some reason, Microsoft
Edge does not want to come up and show
its face on this live stream. But, let
me see if I can try to get it to
reshare. But when you type in Chrome
into uh Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Edge
literally begs you to Yeah, here it is
on the screen.
begs you to use Microsoft Edge. Quote,
"There's no need to download a new web
browser. Microsoft recommends using
Microsoft Edge, but fast, secure, and
modern web experience to help you save
time and money right there. I mean,
Microsoft is quite literally injecting
ads for its own browser that you don't
want to use when you search for other
people's browsers and other people's
search engines." Now, I'm not an
antitrust expert here, but I would say
that that is a lot more um prevalent
than, you know, Google suggesting that
you use Google by having it built in to
the Chrome search bar, the Chrome search
bar, which by by default is not on any
Windows computers at all. But so what is
Google going to have to start paying
Microsoft for the privilege of allowing
it to install Chrome? Is that going to
make the Department of Justice happy?
No. This is absolutely ridiculous court
case here. Even Perplexity kind of sees
it here. And in my opinion, it is so
much easier to change your default
browser in Chrome than it is to your
default search engine, sorry, the
default search engine in Chrome than it
is to change your default search engine
in Edge to switch away from Bing. If you
want to use uh change a search engine
from Google to Yahoo, from Google to
Bing, then then it's fine. Why should
Google have to take out ads to have
people use Bing? I mean, that's ex
absolutely ridiculous. Could you imagine
if uh the Department of Justice forced
Apple to say, "Hey guys, look, Android
is over here. You have it has all these
features, has USBC, it allows you to
have user silo on here, has better
cameras." I mean, it's so much better. I
don't know why people buy us, but it's
No. Okay. Um, quite frankly, it probably
goes against Google's First Amendment
rights. I mean, why are you compelling
them to run an ad campaign funded by
Google to punish themselves for being
good? I mean, what we're doing here is
we're punishing capitalism. We're
punishing you know
goodness you know the free market and
you know I I hate that term but hate
that term like no the free market will
decide the free market's not a person
whatever the free market has decided
that Google is the best right Microsoft
had years long head start they had the
first desktop operating system um years
longer before Chrome OS they had a
chance to get into smartphones before
Android um they potentially could have
even bought Android back in 2005 Samsung
turned them down for $50 million
But they didn't take any of these
chances. They went with Windows Mobile.
They partnered with Nokia. They had MSN
Search and then they had Bing and it
wasn't any good. They had Internet
Explorer. Have all these advantages, all
these tools. And yet they still failed
because Google was just better. Google
was more innovative. And look, if you
feel like Google isn't as innovative as
it is now, you can switch. In fact, I
have switched away from using uh
Google's Gemini to using Microsoft sorry
to Exis Gro for most searches and most
AI tasks uh for editing my images. I've
switched away from chatbt to for editing
my articles, helping me find
information, right? And guess what? X
didn't have to run a ad campaign uh to
force me to use it. Google didn't have
to tell me, "Hey guys, look, Rock is
over there." No, I just used it myself
and I found out it was better. Right.
Chad GBT was first, but Grock was
better. That's that's how it works. You
know, I have Plexi on my phone instead
of Gemini, but I still like to use
Google on here. I have Microsoft Edge as
my phone uh browser and I also have
Chrome on as my phone browser. They both
are
great. The free market competition and I
was easily able to switch. So if someone
is able to easily switch like this and
able to switch and use all these
services uh Google search engine, Google
Chrome on desktop, Microsoft Edge on
mobile, perplexity as your default phone
assistant, Bixby as the as the backup
one, uh Microsoft's uh Word on here.
Okay, I'm not against Microsoft. I mean,
in fact, I'm more integrated than any
other service I I I've seen before. I
got, you know, my Microsoft apps and
services on here running a Microsoft
operating system. We got Excel, uh,
Word, PowerPoint, but I also got a
Android phone. I also have Samsung
Notes. I also use Google search. And
that wasn't because of any ad campaign.
That wasn't because of anything like
that. It's because of the feature set
which was inside of the devices because
the free market won out without any
forcing from the Department of Justice.
I mean it's absolutely ridiculous these
people. So that's why I just want to
talk about Google uh and and Chrome
right there. Now our next uh topic for
today is there was this Reddit
experiment. Let me see if I can type
here. There we go. There was this Reddit
experiment where these people were being
influenced to be using uh
Reddit u to use Reddit. Uh let me see if
I can pull up the report from Reddit
lies.
So if for those of you who don't know uh
Reddit is a social forum site with over
97 million users sometimes 97 million
stupid users and there these question
answer forums etc where let me see if I
can pull up the report where you can
have try to have people change your
minds
uh change your opinions
Let me see if I can find
it. Ah, here it is. Quote here. Here's
the report from Reddit lies online. Um,
let me see if I got to get back to my
recording software. Um, sorry guys.
Quote, "The University
of
Zul, come on. Load. Load." There we go.
Breaking. The University of Zurich has
been using artificial intelligence bots
to secretly manipulate Redditors since
November 2024. The bots are six times
more likely to change the minds of
Redditors than the baseline, often by
leveraging misinformation.
And this is an experiment done by uh the
University of Zulitz which um was
written up in a paper called can AI
change your view and these people um
revealed and released a study that the
usernames of 13 bots that have been
created by the story and 100 Redditors
minds were potentially changed by this.
Now of course there are people out there
who are saying no this is terrible this
is terrible Red Reddit should should ban
these accounts. the AI thing is bad. You
know, it's promoting misinformation. But
look, if your opinions were so stupid
that they were changed by some AI bot on
Reddit, if your opinions are so are so
fickle that they're changed by some
random person yapping on Reddit or
something about something, your opinions
are going to change anyway. Okay, for
those of you who don't know, Reddit is
just a hive of just like left-wing LGBTQ
insanity. Okay, that that is what Reddit
is. I'm sorry. If your opinion is going
to be changed by these people, by some
AI bot, I mean, it was going to get
changed either way. That's my stance on
this. You know, AI is cool. Great. Good
job, uh, to the report, too. Their
opinions are going to get changed
anyway. Better do it now, sooner, later
than ever. And, you know, I think it's
really nice that, you know, AI is now at
a spot that you it is now human human
readable, right? It doesn't sound like a
early 2022 chat GPT where it's like
obviously you can tell that it's written
by AI. Obviously you can tell it's
generated by
AI and it's just like you know Mark
Zuckerberg I heard that he was trying he
said that the average at least in the
United States has three friends you need
15. He wants to supplement that with his
own artificial intelligence friends,
right? And of course, people are
freaking out. Oh my goodness, this is
dystopian. Oh my goodness, this is
terrible. Oh my goodness, this is
horrible. Of course, you know, Hollywood
has programmed each and every one of
you. I haven't seen any of these movies,
so it hasn't programmed me, but
Hollywood has programmed each and every
one of you to hate AI, to hate
computers, to hate all of these things,
right? There's there's no reason you
hate it. The only reason you hate it is
because you say it's slop, because you
say it's soulless, because you think
it's going to take over the world. But
in reality, these uh chatbot programs
and these chatbot friend programs, which
is going to be essentially you have the
internet or scanned book or something
like that and
you it's basically summarizing you and
it summarizing it and explaining it
better better to you. Okay? Have you
seen how some people text, right? I
mean, it's not like it's going to
replace your friendships, okay? It's
it's not going to replace your
friendships. Have you seen how some
people text? It's so boring, so
mid. I mean, heck, have an AI chatbot do
it for you. What do I care? No, people
like it, they like it. They use it. If
people don't want it, then it's a waste
of money for them. But we shouldn't be
criticizing him for being anti-human or
quote dystopian. And that's the whole
broader criticisms of AI as a whole.
It's these It's always these people.
It's always these people who are going
around and they're like, "Oh, well, AI
is soulless, slob. You just say that
because you don't have any any actual
defense. Oh, uh, the people who hate AI
are just annoying." Okay? They're like
they're like uh they they they feel like
that they are higher mightier than thou
or holier than thou. Yeah. That that
that is that is what they are doing.
These people are just like yeah I didn't
use AI. I'm not saying use AI to cheat
or something like that but just like
turning your nose up at AI because you
want to because because you can because
you feel like it because you know you're
better than than the rest. Absolutely
ridiculous.
I mean it it kind of gives the vibe of
Linux users which is
just here we have another thing from
Reddit lies here again and you might be
wondering why like these Reddit you know
accounts where they aggregate them like
Reddit lies Reddit echo chamber or uh
now Reddit or a charge um like the these
these accounts and how I always
criticize um our word finder was because
these accounts Reddit 97 million people
is larger than the entire country of
Germany, which is uh kind of bad
considering the history of Germany and
considering the history of what's on
Reddit is that he actually goes in, he
he does investigations. Well, he does
investigations, he writes articles, he
actually provides benefit. Okay, he's
actually useful. It actually this
actually brings me joy. Like his account
and Reddit echo chamber or edit Reddits
brings me joy. They're actually funny.
Okay, the award finder has just
essentially gone around and uh found
pictures of people that you know
obviously most people don't like, called
them mean names and then he is then
within the span of like a few weeks then
started criticizing Israel or whatever
or Ben and then launched the meme point
like he did the entire grifting thing in
like two two months. Okay, most people
like Candace Omen or whatever she she
did that in like five month five years.
Sorry. All right. So, see she was in the
she was in the game for a long time
before she started being griffy and
whiny and annoying and pinchant. Now, uh
I would find her apparently got, you
know, half a million people to follow
him for some reason because he called,
you know, people most people don't like
me. He does a video about this. I'll
probably link it below a mean name and
now like monetize it. So, he creates
some cryptocurrency coin which is now at
I think it high was around like 13 cents
per token or whatever. I think it is now
at 0.06 cents. So about half a cent um
per token. So uh yeah, pretty going
going well um for him over there. But
you know, at least oil and Reddit, Echo
Chamber um these people, you know, they
actually provide value. They actually
provide joy. Okay, that they actually
provide value. They actually provide
joy. But this ties back into the broader
Linux conversation. I was watching them
videos of Linux tech tips trying to
switch over to Linux. And the thing is
the people who use Linux is just this
the most annoying people of of of all
time. Let's look at the sticker suit.
You got Oh guys, I got Linux. I got
Linux here. Have you ever seen anyone
with the Windows computer, you know,
like stick on it? Well, got Windows on
here. Yeah, that's right. That's Windows
uh 11 uh
2H222 with the newest security feature
update. Yeah, got to have that sticker
on here. Yeah, but you just virtue
signaling because you like to type in
your little command prompt. Type in my
little command prompt. Yeah, I'm a
commie. I use Linux. It's free. Yeah,
socialism is great. That's that's that's
what Linux uh boils down to essentially.
with monogamy in this economy. What is
wrong with you? Jesus was a socialist
which is no and also Jesus is so um take
that stick off trans rights and human
rights sometimes antisocial and always
anti-fascist. I I I don't know what
these are. This and this and this trans
rights protect trans kids. Y'all means
all trans rights. I What is that?
Um the SDF or I think some like th those
organizations too. Those organizations
are free the the Linux thing. Yes guys,
Linux is amazing. The free software
foundation. I was watching this video of
some uh Lines Tech Tips was looking at
this Linux computer that was meant for
the education market because they
believe they want to get a laptop to
every kid in in the world for education,
whatever, which is admirable. That's
great. But why must you torture children
to force them to use Linux? Okay, Linux,
if it's not for these annoying little
sticker people that we uh just just
showed here, is a trash operating
system. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but Linux
is garbage. It is a absolutely horrible
um operating system. And because it's
absolutely horrible, you have to sit
around on those forums and use it and
interact with these little scum of the
earth people. I'm sorry. The Linux is
garbage. Okay, think about. So, first of
all, the whole Linux ethos thing is
like, hey guys, it's we're freedom.
We're open source. We're amazing. We're
terrible. We're taking you away from the
shackles of
corporatism. Okay, first of all, Windows
is good because you, you know, you have
a GUI. It doesn't crash all the time.
You know, the you you can get a lot more
support. You have a lot more supported
software. Mac OS is trash, but I mean,
at least you have that
option. Linux Linux has like a skin, but
you have to go into the terminal all the
time. You want to download an app or
something? Well, maybe you can download
the package and maybe it might work
sometimes, maybe not. Maybe. But then,
um, if it doesn't work, then you have to
go into these people. And these people
apparently have no life. They have no
family. They have no friends. They have
no food. They have no deodorant. And you
have to go into the store for be like, I
can't install Firefox. What's happened
to you? And they'll go check through
your Reddit history and be like,
"Fascist, fascist. We're not going to
tell you."
or they'll go through your uh your your
forum history be like why didn't you try
with get pseudoapp update
uh noob and then they'll block you or
something and be like take take the
moral high ground but you running a
laptop that was around when Clinton was
president shut up okay we here in the
modern world actually like to use modern
operating systems that actually work is
more secure
yeah why why you care about Okay.
Anyway, Linux Linux is a a trash
operating system and like the only good
dro of it is Android, which
is Yeah. No. Okay. So, Linux is garbage.
You have to interact with these people.
This is why I hate open source movement
in Linux. It It sucks. You have to read
your forms. You The open source
community is trash. They're They're all
about freedom. But who do you think you
are? You You are not the United States
of America. You're not a country.
Okay. You you aren't a country uh Linux
people. Okay. You you're Oh, freedom,
democracy. You and your friends are
somehow on websites that are worse than
government websites. I'm sorry. H how is
that possible? Like government websites
look like uh you took a book from 2008
was like, "Yep, this is what we're going
to be doing in
2050." But you know, Linux websites are
like, "Why you even use a web browser to
access this, bro?" Like, uh you should
have been using an FTP server. Heaven
forbid you like to have my GUI. Oh no,
that's that's horrible. I I like the
terminal one. So much faster and more
efficient. And you we we have gooies for
a reason, people. Because they're easier
and better to use. That's why. And also,
you're not associated mostly if you use
Windows. And you might be associated
kind of with them if you use uh Mac OS
with the uh freedom movement sticker
people uh like this. So yeah, that that
this perfectly alone is a good reason
why not to use Linux. Linux is trash and
Linux is garbage. Okay, like the the the
Linux defenders are just
so it's not a good
OS. And I mean all of them from Ubuntu
to uh Puppy Linux to all these other
random dros, you know, I wish it was so
much easier, you know, if we just had a
nice little hacking disro for Windows. I
know there's like a Red Hat something
last I think was 20 19. I'm trying to
install that on here. But like, bro,
come on. Linux is trash. We all know
that. And the most annoying people are
going to be Linux users. Let's be for
real here. Um, stickers none with
standard. All right. Now, on to another
trend here that's also annoying here.
So, I'm going to Yep. This is muted. All
right. Um, there's this woman here who
Shut up. There's this woman here who was
cooking a pizza and I'm gonna display
the video in its entirety so that we can
get your honest reactions. Come on,
chat. There's like seven people watching
you. Okay, I just did a whole van on
Linux. So, I mean, I know one of you is
probably annoyed. All right, here we go.
Here's this woman.
Watch. I thought I muted
this. All right, so she's uh cooking a
pizza here. Why you'd wear that to cook
a pizza? But
whatevers. We're not going to stay here
for 32 seconds and watch a woman cut a
pizza. Okay, look. You want to watch
cooking videos, go watch is about a
movie look. Anyway, um that's the video.
Now you be wondering, okay, that's
interesting. Woman cut a pizza. How
nice. Yeah. Um apparently people thought
that she's uh 13, which uh she's not. I
looked it up. She's 20. Does anyone in
this video in the chat here think that
the women look 13? This is the whole
trend that's actually online for some
reason. Like obvious woman apparently
being compared to 13-y olds, which is
like maybe it's just because you haven't
been
around in in in a school or like around
teenagers. Maybe you don't have kids as
much, but that she she's not 13 unless
13-year-olds have just aged dramatically
uh since the last time I was 13. Like
what? What?
No. No. in the comments are like, "Wow,
she looks like an actual chap." No, she
does not. What's wrong with you people?
It's just It's just absolutely
ridiculous. I mean, for for the trends
that we have gone over today, the anti
the anti
[Music]
uh the anti- um the anti-AI trend, the
pro Linux trend, and the random women
look like 10-year-olds trend. I guess I
I'm probably going to say that the Linux
people are the most annoying, but I
really don't engage with them as much
because when you're owning Linux, that's
what I usually use is for like cyber
security. And then the anti- AI trend,
it's just annoying. And like they're
like, man, I'm better slob. I can't
believe you use AI slob. Like the word
slo is just annoying. Okay, we should
just ban it from from the
dictionary. Okay.
like like like we just showed.
Okay, these these people trying to sell
freedom democracy. You are not the
United States of America. You are not a
country. Okay, you're a stupid Linux
district website that looks hacker was
made when the worldwide web was invented
like it was the first website on the
internet. But now let's get to the real
topic of today's discourse which is have
landlines I mean has the internet
landlines and communication
worse for
example analog phone lines we have
analog phone lines uh mo most phones
today are now voice over internet
protocol which is VIP that's posted in
the VIP Linux uh Reddit forum
here and I believe that the that has
potentially made communication works.
Now, I'm not going to sit here and be
like internet bad. See, now with all
these chat apps and yada yada yada, you
you you can leave that
for some ministry or whatever. Okay. Uh
you can you can leave internet botism
for for uh for for them. It's just
ridiculous. All right. Anyway, yeah.
Yeah. I'm not going to sit around and
condemn the internet as a whole. What
I'm going to say is that uh in pursuit
of this technology that we have lost so
much good technology
um over the course of years. So let's
talk about dialup internet. Not dialup
internet. Dialup internet is not a good
technology. I'm talking about dialing in
to a computer to remote access with or
to send files to it anyway if internet
were to go out. Right? Remember phone
lines like then the analike phone lines
really did not go out. Now you may be
wondering okay what's wrong with the
phone lines that we have now? Well,
voice over internet protocol, as you may
hear in the name, means that you need
internet to have a phone, which is just
I mean it's absolutely ridiculous. Why
should you need an internet connection
to have a
phone?
Like I mean, Alexander Graham Bell
uh the
phone 100 years before the internet was
invented.
So, like when when when phones in 1967,
uh, they
worked fine. Well, I'm not saying VIP
shouldn't exist. No, I'm all for I'm all
for this, right? I also said that VIP
the reason it can't, you know, access
some of those legacy systems, want to do
some wild war diving or anything like
that. If I had a VIP line or whatever is
the problem is, first of all, the
software for war diving isn't even made
anymore. Like we had the entire episode
about that and it's absolutely
ridiculous. But the the software for
stuff like that, it's just
like the the lines itself can't carry as
much bandwidth as they did in analog
phone. So they don't carry much phone
noise or anything. This is again
ridiculous. Think about it. In the
1990s, you would have been able to link
a computer to another computer to uh you
know, I guess chat back with each other.
You could access files. You could do all
of that. But now you can't. Why? Like
why? How? How is this even remotely
better? And I think it's also come down
into radio technology as
well. Let me see if I can pull up the
image.
I feel like that we have lost some of
this radio
technology. Chatting over radio waves
for for example, right? If I want to
chat over radio
waves,
apparently there is this tool that they
had back in the old days. Let me see if
I can pull it up.
Uh well anyway there was this thing they
had back in the old days before they had
computers before the internet was thing
where you could chat over radio waves
and
uh you know you know it was essentially
like texting each. Let me see I forgot
what it was called.
Uh, RTY. So, I'm going to pull up an
image of the machine and then pull up
the Reddit forum thread that we have.
Oh, yeah. Radio teletype. This is an
image of a radio teletype. Hopefully,
you can see this on the
screen. Yeah. So this is a radio
teletype machine here and you are able
to send chats. Well, that's not the
teletype machine.
RTY. Ah, here we go. This is the radio
teletype machine. You're able to send
chats over radio broadcast. They print
out um right here. You have your
keyboard. You have your I guess paper
monitor or whatever here. I think they
even had some digital versions of these
uh as soon as they got more advanced.
But I
mean, if I want to make one of these on
a computer, if I want to ask people how
I can chat over radio waves on a
computer, we got 49 comments here, 5,400
views, no up vote for some reason, and
you
go and let's go through all the things
that happened here and see when they're
invented. Cuz I mean, think about If we
have technology like this back in the
1930s being used by like AP News to
transmit news wires all over the United
States of America, you know, during
World War I, World War II, um, for to
and from Germany and uh, England and
Europe, uh, back to the United States to
be able to chat over radio waves, no
computers, no internet, no phone. You
you would think that this might be
potentially possible maybe with, I don't
know, a radio dongle and some type of
software. Plug it in, boop, you got it
here already. I mean, even Motorola for
crying out loud has uh example uh like
this Motorola Solutions portable FRS
T802. Talk about 2A radios,
walkie-talkie, emergency preparedness,
rechargeable 22 channel, 35 miles,
black, two pack. All right, so that is
the that that is the uh motor radio
here. You might be thinking, okay, how
is this interesting here? But you might
notice I still don't think it Bluetooth,
which was actually invented by a woman.
Um, fun fact.
Uh, why does it have Bluetooth? You may
wondering. It's because it interfaces
with an
application. See if I can. Yeah, it
interfaces with an application where you
can share your location and send text
messages off the grid using and
Motorola's own manual uses this word
using this as a modem modem for
uh uh
communication with no PC software. Why?
Why would you make this and not even add
uh computer software in it? And this
proves this proves that you can transmit
text and location data. Um the location
data comes from the GPS on the phone. So
I understand why it has a phone app text
and location data without needing a
radio without needing internet. But
apparently we have moved away from this.
We have we have moved away from this
um this
this study of of radio
communication. Like radio communication
seems to be a lost art or something like
like apparently everything just wants to
access it, put it on the internet. In
the 1930s, we have radio tele machines.
In the 2020s, we have these
walkie-talkie videos that can transmit
text and text that uh but only if you
have an app on your phone. I mean, isn't
that
ridiculous? Now, let's go back to uh the
chat of radio wave 2. They talked about
mestastic. I think that was invented
like in 2014 or something like that.
There's some other people talking about
in Lova
uh which was invented by France in 2014
which is a different type of radio
frequency here.
Um cell phone messaging but that's using
the tower so it doesn't really count.
The motor T800 which I was talking about
uh these tools here but they didn't
really talk about it. More meshtastic
thing here. Rattlegram which we've
talked about that before. It's another
phone app that transmits that kind of
like squishy sound over the
walkie-talkie microphone. It's not it's
not useful there because you know might
as well just text someone. Um and then
there's some people talking about ham
radio licenses here. You would think
that with technology like this in the
1930s it might be oh I don't know
possible to send text messages. You
might think that in the 1990s when
you're able to remotely access a
computer over a phone line that you'd be
able to do that now but no that's
impossible. You you might think that
it's possible to do some of these
things, but look, I tried to build an
offline spy base for you guys. Here, I
built my own mostly offline spy base
here. This is an article from the
techboy.org, which essentially has shown
how hard it is to get into radio
technology these days. I remember in one
of the first podcast episodes of this
year, we were talking about how these
like toy phones that had their own
numbers to actually like walkie-talkies.
They advertised over uh three miles of
range and they use RF or whatever radio
frequencies to communicate with each
other. You would think that a phone like
that coming out in 2002 would actually
be, you know, more advanced now or
today. Heck, maybe they can integrate
that into our phones today. I mean, I'm
pretty sure you could put like a little
transmitter in here where you can
communicate with your friends over a
three mile radius because that would be
great. Think about you got a concert,
you're in a place where there's no
internet, you kind of like directly
transmitting audio and pictures to each
other. I mean, it's possible. But
apparently people say, "Well, if the
internet exists, we're just going to put
everything on it." And I'm a big fan of
the internet, but like we just have more
redundancy in this as well. So, here is
how to build an offline spy base. We're
going to break down this article. We're
going to get into some of the things
here, but we're also going to notice the
insane amount of workarounds I have to
do just to get like remote access stuff
and software software like this. So, for
your security setup here, we have your
uh Defender cameras. They're not
sponsored. I am contacting them to see
if I can get a setup for cameras here.
And notice what you see here. This is
essentially one of the only two that I
was able to find. The Fenix HD security
camera and the Seymour CTV system. So,
this is the Phoenix system. They have
advertised at 10,00 foot range. They're
wired um into the electricity, but they
transmit wirelessly over into this
tablet-l like screen with 64 GB of
storage here. So, it's like a baby
monitor, but for security
cameras. Why don't we see more of this?
I only saw literally two options for
RFbased um cameras on Google or
Amazon. We know it's possible. You see
the technology right there. I can buy
off Amazon for $200 right now if I
wanted
to. I mean, and this system has so many
features that could be added to it.
First of all, you could have system that
records off to an SSD. You can have a
system records off to a hard drive where
it connect to a monitor. You could have,
oh, I don't know, PC software because
apparently there's some type of weird
technology that no one knows about in
this little tablet thing here where it
only it alone can decode the frequencies
of the Defender cameras here. You mean
to tell me that in the U 2025 there's no
way that there's some type of adapter
that we can plug into a computer, have
like a tiny little camera that transmits
over our radio frequencies? you you know
if you look up spy camera on Amazon
right now you're going to see a whole
list of these little c dinky cameras
that either transmit terrible terrible
image quality terrible terrible privacy
policies and you need some random
Chinese app and you need to connect it
to Wi-Fi etc like what how did the CIA
spy on people before um the
1990s like Wi-Fi wasn't a thing how do
they transmit video in 1954 a group of
Russian uh children transmitted uh uh
gave gave President Eisenhower this
thing called thing which was a radio bug
that was sitting in the Oval Office for
many years and Russian agents could pick
it up on their transmitters here. Now
that may sound interesting that's great
except do you know how hard it is to
find some type of RF bug? I didn't put
one in here because it was like insanely
expensive. Why is that hard? Why is that
hard? When essentially same technology
and this is the workaround that I had
for it where you have this little dongle
here. You plug it into your computer and
then you set it as a mic in Audacity. I
go into the details in that article. You
take off the fuzz part of this and this
is essentially a lapel mic I got off of
uh that website I did some work for
again. So they had me u buy some stuff
off the website and then I reviewed
flip. Yeah, that's what it's called. So
uh it's essentially like Tik Tok but for
shopping. Um anyway, a two in one sorry
three in one dual mic cost like $17 off
a flip. I got them for free. Not
sponsored. This is the same technology.
This transmits to this base where you
can see here. You plug it in. I don't
know how long of a range it has, but I'm
pretty sure that's a pretty good range.
At least enough to like bug something.
And then you tune on Audacity and now
you can
live. But I mean, we want that and like
spy bugs. Well, I I don't know how that
technology is going to work, you know? I
mean, it's only existed for over a
hundred years. I mean,
You know, like there's no camera version
of this except for like baby monitors
which are huge and inconspicuous. But
the point is if you can have the baby
monitor, why why can't we intercept that
with the SDR? Why is no one invented
like a little RF switch you can plug
into USB and you can now see RF camera
feed stream too. What is that technology
like proprietary license? Has the NSA
have it and you can't make it anymore?
Like, how is this hard? It is not that
hard. Baby monitors for crying out loud.
Baby
monitors. You mean you couldn't
miniaturize it? You mean there's no
decoder for it? You know, it's so hard
to find under the um actual slop of
junky Chinese app control miniature spy
cameras that you get off of uh Amazon
for $9 that stick that are the size of a
dime but like barely
work. Or maybe you can make your own
with like a Raspberry Pi. But once
again, it's the same thing that's wrong
with Linux. Like it barely works. You
try to code something, it barely
works. How is this
hard? Here we have the Spy Secret motion
radar. Um, you know what that is? I did
a video about it. It's a small little
radar that transmits signals out and it
can detect people and objects moving
through walls. Great. Is there a bigger
version of this? You know, Spy might go
out of business. You probably don't want
to be relying on a toy company for your
security reasons and meet needs. Nah,
only motion detectors that we get are,
you know, little security motion
detectors. Portable motion detectors.
Who needs
that? Like
what? The spy gear phone case here.
Transmits over Wi-Fi. That's why. Now
I'm from Mavic. Here we have a 3D map in
this software called Real Home 3D. So
Real Home 3D rated it slow.
exceptionally hard to put a ceiling on
the
wall. What? Why can you not just put a
ceiling in your 3D mapping
software?
Why? And then you have GPS receiver
gathered by GPS receiver of a phone.
This is a screenshot of
ArcGIS. And they have a button here that
allows you to transmit. Here it is the
button here. Things from a GNSS device
uh around over here. But the one time
that you want internet, the one time
that hey, maybe it might be useful to
oh, I don't know, have an app on your
phone where you can track your phone in
ArcGIS. That might be helpful. That
might be useful, especially for an
article like this. You can talk to your
little agents or
whatever. Oh, well, you know, those apps
don't exist. Or have a little earpiece
that's not like Bluetooth, that's not
connected to a phone or something cuz
like she want that just use AirPods.
Like a little radio transmitter
earpiece. Well, can't find that. No sir.
Black I mean come on. We you know that I
know that the technology
exists. It's just what not commercially
viable? Is there is a link uh is is
there a hold on this kind kind of
technology? And then Microsoft and
Carter which even to this day has some
of the best graphics some of the best
charts some of the best atlas features
on here right it combined all all these
features into a 2 GB
program. But somehow no we can't have
them carded today. Do you know why I
linked Inquarta 2009 Inquarta 2021 or
something? Because it's the last version
of Inarta because you know Wikipedia
took over or whatever which is just
ridiculous. Fine. Wikipedia took over or
I don't know maybe you could put out in
Carter every 5 years or something like
everything does not need to be web-
based especially for like spy toys and
encyclopedias or I don't
know. I mean, it's absolutely
ridiculous. And I think that's the
problem that everything is moving so far
and fast to the web that now we're just
going to be left with Instagram, Tik
Tok, X,
whatever. Look, social media
applications when computers even from
the 90s could do so so much more. Like
we talking about diving in to to to a
network, satellite communication. I was
reading a report saying that the Windows
95 event, this was the big this is like
pre- internet, even Microsoft wasn't
really in on the internet thing. They
were transmitting the video live via
satellite in
1995. But you want to find out how that
works without just saying, "Oh, well the
satellite de modulates this and it sends
to a truck and it's like a third grade
graphic." Well, I mean that's nope. Not
not happening now. You're going to get
more articles about satellite internet
or Starlink or whatever, which is great,
but you know, maybe it might be great if
you could remotely access computer over
a satellite network without needing to
access the internet. like we have other
networks in place and I think RF radio
frequency
and and satellite might be the best
options. I don't know. And the one thing
that was so annoying here is that
there's one GPS tracker thing here. So,
it's essentially the same problem about
the GPS trackers that they put on those
stupid phones like the Gab phone and the
Bark phone and all those phones that
like from Track Cage or whatever, but
the Subaru highly
overpriced. They put GPS on them, but
they advertise as no internet when
obviously it has internet because they
need the SIM card to send it back.
That's how all almost all GPS trackers
work today. I had to go dig and find
some 16-year-old invention of the
um radiobased GPS track who meant for
model rocket so that you don't lose them
when you launch them up in the air and
has some like homing software on it. You
mean to tell me that there's no possible
way that you can home something without
um the access to the internet? You you
mean to tell me that, you know, radio
tracking, which has been around for
years and years and years, GPS, which
has been around about 10 years before
the worldwide web was
invented, couldn't work without the
internet, couldn't work without the
worldwide web. No, just these people got
lazy and said, "Let's put some quads in
it." And now here's this one thing that
I actually found interesting. a low
tracker that offers about nine miles of
range. But I thought, wow, this is
great. It's a little tracker. You have
your thing here. You have a receiver,
but you need an app to access it
because I mean, heaven forbid you want
to track something on a PC. I mean, who
wants to do that? which is is kind of
sad because it shows the desktop
computer market is dying and it's
getting replaced by the app market which
is great in concepts like this with the
low tracking here which also terrible
and sad because now all you have is Tik
Tok and Instagram Facebook Reddit
etc. And it kind of stifles innovation
you know if we didn't put everything on
the web and maybe put 33% on satellite
33% on web 33% on I'm not saying like
websites or anything like that I'm
saying like put technologies that you
know try to piss forth all this
technology
then we'd be in a much better place,
much more advanced place than we were in
the 90s. Instead of regressing back like
in this graphic here has internet
landlines and communications
worse. I mean, it's just
ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. All
right, here's our next topic here. Teen
sitcoms died. What happened to the good
teen sitcoms? Okay, look, we don't have
Disney Plus. It's like super expensive.
But I've been watching YouTube reviews
of Disney Plus. I've been watching
YouTube of of of teen sitcoms here. And
some of the best were Drake and Josh.
Uh I calling Zoe 101,
uh Sweet Life on Deck, and the show that
came before it. Oh yeah, the Sweet Life
of Zach and
Cody. But now you look at a list of uh
the team sitcoms and it is uh
rough
wuff. I mean it's garbage. Absolutely
garbage. Wait. Some some of these
sitcoms are promoting like terrible
values are
just garbage. They're shot weird.
They're they're
they're
just I I don't know what they
are. Let me see if I can pull up the
post. They banned it, but let me see if
I can still find it. No, it's not up
anymore. Dang
it. Like the teen sitcoms. Apparently
they went away because kids are on Tik
Tok. So you mean to tell me that a fully
feature limp show with like jokes
and things like
that or just gone with with with jokes
and comedy, you know. Oh well, you know
there's some kids on Tik Tok. If you go
look at the Disney Channel schedule now,
let me go pull up the Disney Channel
schedule. Disney Channel. If you if you
pull it up now, it's absolutely garbage.
Let let's look at these amazing amazing
shows that uh Disney Channel has um put
put on for us. Now, let's remember the
greatness of shows I haven't seen but
have heard reviews of and they look
really really good. Just remember the
greatness of these shows. Sweet Life of
Zach and Cody.
Uh just think of some Oh, uh Good Luck
Charlie. I saw like one episode of that.
Even Phineas and
Fobe. Just think of your favorite 2000s
teen Disney sitcom, Cory and the House.
Whatever. Haven't seen any of these
shows. I've seen reviews of them and
they look a lot better than the junk
that uh is coming out now. This is the a
show. Um here here's the Disney Channel
schedule for Fridays and Saturdays. Also
remember decoms decoms like trash now.
There's like one out, okay? And a whole
bunch of teens kissing or whatever. So
this is the uh schedule for Friday and
Saturday. And let's think about this.
Fridays and Saturdays would probably be
the best days for the best shows to come
on air for Disney Channel, which I I
don't even know why how it's a channel
anymore. All the kids are on TikTok or
something. Anyway, Percy Jackson and the
Olympians, Wizards of Waverly Place. Oh,
so the show needs reruns, but I mean
there's not there's nothing new. K,
which is like some animated show, I
think. But K is good at sports. Kif
finds out she's good at sports. welcomes
unwelcome intruders overtake the
tragedy's backyard. Not a sitcom. It's
just like some animated show. All right,
here we go. Back to May 3. Big City
Greens, which is some stupid
animated. You had actual good TV shows,
but no, we got to put this on for the
kids are up at 1:00 in the morning. I
mean, it is big city greens from 12 to 3
or maybe even four. Yeah, four. Then
back to K, which is
What the
what? How How did Disney go from like
actual sitcoms to whatever the heck this
is? Is that
a This would be like
if Oh my gosh. Bluey, Mickey Mouse, Big
City Greens again,
Stugo. I these shows are absolutely
garbage.
Like, just just shut down as a channel.
You shouldn't exist
anymore. Or at least play the reruns of
these shows that people actually like.
Do you know why?
Like, do you know why? because no one's
doing retrospectives reviews of freaking
K and Bluey and um Big City Greens.
They're doing retrospectives and and and
uh and reviews of decoms from Sila the
1990 to
2003es. So yeah, before everyone started
getting smartphones and I guess like I I
guess like stopped liking TV. I mean,
Disney, if they were smart, could see
this as an opportunity and be like, you
know what? You know, now that phones
don't have screens the size of two
inches anymore. And now they have 6.8 in
screens. Maybe, just maybe. I don't know
about this, guys. I don't know. This
This could be hard. Maybe we can let
them access Disney Channel on their
phone and watch actually good shows on
their phone that they actually like on
their phone. Like, nah.
on Disney cable
channel. We're gonna
have this like just absolutely
ridiculous. It's terrible. Terrible for
the culture. I mean, absolutely
horrendous uh again for for the culture
here. All right. Now, I'm going to uh
get away from back to our stories I have
queued up here because I have another
story. Get back on the radio rant. Okay.
Today's just a really ranty day. Let me
see if I can find my bookmarks. You
know, I wish Chrome had a better
bookmark manager, but it is what it is.
You see, if I type in this in from uh
you know, some of my best research comes
from when I go back in time and go like
search through 2001 because before like
the web took over. Um and they'll have
articles that are actually interesting
and
exciting. Building a H here it is
building a computer controlled radio
transmitter. Now, this article, I
believe, is from 2001, I think. I'm I'm
checking the date. It's not saying, but
this website is still up. So, pretty
good point here in my opinion. Hope you
guys can see this on the
screen. How would you like to send text
messages to your friends without wires
without internet connection without
paying monthly fees? Yes. See, there it
is right there. Right off the bat. Now,
if there's today, you probably go, "Oh,
well, maybe if you can pair your phones
or like a whole bunch of Lola
transmitters, you pair them via
Bluetooth. If you have like 10 of them
going down the street, house to house,
then you might maybe be able to send a
little Bluetooth message to someone on
on your phone or have like some little
open-source project." No, I don't have
no open source project here. I don't
have to build this thing off with an
Arduino, a paperclip, thoughts and
prayers, and a little Linux distro. I
want it to actually work. N
No, no. You want to text on the street?
Oh, you're gonna need internet for that.
Um, anyway, building a computer
controlled radio transmitter. In this
product, we build a very simple radio
transmitter to attach the serial port on
your computer, which once again shows
how ports like that loss of ports have
basically killed computers. Like, why
don't we have modems on our laptops
anymore? Huh? I mean, you could you
could probably fit one in here. All
right, come on.
I mean, that's the one thing that that
person with the 35 million stickers on
the back of the Lenovo uh laptop when um
Kennedy was president uh has on he he
has he probably has a modem port on
there and probably a typewriter for a
keyboard, but
whatever. You need your serial port
connector. You need some wire for an
antenna and add a Tesla. And this is
2001, right? So, like I was saying, we
don't want to have to build it
ourselves. But maybe he was probably
thinking, you know, back in 2002, you
know, they had those like fake phones
come out for for the kids. He's probably
thinking, "Oh, maybe they'll be able to
make this themselves or whatever." Like
some company might be able to pick this
up and make it, right? So, you build
your little transmitter here, which I
mean, pretty sure you can probably
figure out a better way to do this. You
build your transmitter here. Then you
get a computer program that trans
translates Morse code in into thing in
here. don't even know what this you send
your message and you have your friend be
to send it as
well. And notice how this computer
program is a computer program. He didn't
try to link you to some stupid web app
with 50 million ads on it. You need to
sign up for an account and also, you
know, kind of defeats the entire purpose
of the project. Seeing as if it's a web
app, you need access to the internet
which at that point just DM
them. I mean actually ridiculous. This
is website code breaker website can that
can like crack Caesar
ciphers but apparently Caesar cipher
code
websites you know you can't download on
Windows. You know, the the Enigma
machine absolutely worked offline in
1945. But I mean, you want to break
codes in
2025. I mean, it's too hard work. Too
much hard work. You know, it it's it's
just it's just too much. Just hard work.
Can't wait to watch KIF tonight. That's
what kids Yeah. No, no one no one in the
history of uh Disney Channel or
Nickelodeon has ever said that in the
history of um of TV watching. Yeah. I'm
absolutely
ridiculous. I It's
just It's just sad. It's so
sad. And you know what's also
sad?
This. It's local news dead. So, we did a
segment on this again, but I posted in
the journalism subreddit here, right?
Yeah. I was talking about here in
Houston. We have our Fox affiliate. We
have our CNN doesn't have affiliate.
Sorry. We have our Fox affiliate. We
have
our I
guess what are they ABC? Yeah, ABC ABC
affiliate. We have our I don't know who
KPRC is or KO is or
whatever. I
mean,
like, local news is so dead. It's It's
so dead. It's not even funny.
Like it's it's garbage. Like we we redid
this a little bit of this on the uh
website. It's so freaking boring. It's
so boring.
I like these people. All right, let me
let me let me show show the post to you.
Okay, so there's this application called
Citizen on all Android phones and all
iOS phones. They can download them. You
can see all the events that happening.
So much exciting stuff, exciting crimes
happen around here and you can put them
up on the map.
And yeah, someone's house got broken
into around here. I looked it up on
Citizen, but guess what? Did Did Fox uh
26 report on that? No. Did ABC13 report
on that? No. There was nothing on Google
for it. Maybe I should have checked
Bing, you know, seeing as the DOJ thinks
that Bing is pretty good or something
like
that. And none of the outlets report on
that. You want to go search Google
search for local Houston news outlet?
Fine. Have fun. You know what you're
going to find?
ABC13, Fox 26, KPC,
KPRC, Channel 2. And it's just the same
thing, the same graphics, and the same
boring
stories. Nothing remotely interesting.
The stories from the affiliates, quote,
aren't remotely interesting. No exposes,
no local features. There's not anything
from fiction, interesting local news,
news, some kid detect may investigator,
some reporter may investigate something.
I know we talked about this last week,
but like 22,000 people. Let's go through
the worst of things here. Houston
Chronicle is the worst local paper I've
ever read. Houston Chronicle is just
it's boring. Okay, there's nothing in
there. There's nothing in there. There's
nothing interesting. I don't even know
why they have offices. I don't even know
why they have reporters. Like, it just
gets this stuff off the
internet. Uh the Texas Tribune, which is
just more geared towards Texas. Doesn't
even count towards locals. So, I don't
know what they're talking about here.
Let's go next.
um the high school journalism used the
high schools to have websites or better
but then again we looked into what uh I
think it was Carnegie and St. John
school had for um journalism. It was
great but didn't really go outside their
school or if it went outside their
school talk about some like random Tik
Tok trend or something like that. Not
journalism. Not really anything
interesting. Uh like like I did an
entire
investigation into this school over in
uh Lions County High School I believe.
Now that is a school that actually has
journalism. Their website is actually
useful. Their journalism website is
actually good. Now, yes, they have 4,000
people, and yes, they started uh
electing student council presidents like
big time. I did a whole video about
that. And yes, they have a radio
station. Yes, they have a TV station.
So, like it's really good there. But
like there are so much more competent
and so much better than like half the
news agencies and organizations here in
Houston. And like how how is it bad that
bad? Let me see. Houston's a big city.
It was a very robust news outlet.
There's this website called The Landing
that got 20 I think it was a million
dollar in cash or investments or
whatever. $20 million and I had never
heard of it. It never came up in Google
search. $20 million and they couldn't
figure out SEO. You know, if I had $20
million, the tech boy would literally be
on the first page whenever you type in
everything in anything on Google. You
want to type in Samsung, the tech boy is
going to be popping up. I'm gonna type
in Apple, the tech boy is gonna be
popping up. When I type in um Whole
Foods, the tech boy is gonna be popping
up. When I type in Alexa, the tech boy
is gonna be popping up. I had $20
million. You know, I became the first
page on Google in like two
uh years when you type in on him. And
guess
what? It it didn't really cost anything.
It cost like $24 for the domain name and
that's it over over the two years.
How how like this this thing should be
coming up in news. We know it's coming
up in news. The actual news outlets that
thing I went over to the website,
they're like dying. They're they're
going to be down at like the end of the
month at the end of the summer
maybe. And it's
like horrible. It's it's horrible. And
according to Jono editor, Jono throwway
editor, he says I I should start my own
hyperlocal site. uh one person who cares
about the community is curious and can
manage to get super biased on every
issue maybe a suspect or a blog or a Tik
Tok or Instagram page which is just
like someone could have done that or
also again in this neighborhood just
like it' be the most boring newspaper of
all time that's ever newspaper in the
history of
newspapers
but
like some someone could have figured
this out someone with $20 million could
have oh I don't know put in like little
reporters everywhere else but no This is
trash. Okay. Okay.
Whatever. Uh, Houston Public Radio,
Houston 88.7. I looked them
up. It It's just a radio station. It's
not a It's not a news
website. And NBR is not good for making
this. So, and again, once again, I'm
trying to show that the news media is is
garbage, okay? You know, oh, you can't
hate the media. I don't hate them.
They're just trash. Like, there's
nothing here local that's interesting.
And we go go on to the next thing, which
is just where the heck do you find your
stories? This is more for cable news.
We're also getting to the uh uh local
news channels here. Where where do you
find your stories? Please, please, I
want to know. Look, there there are no
stories here that are worth 24 hours of
coverage. I'm sorry. This is like what
what are you people doing? Where do you
even find them? Cuz you're not finding
them here. Do you know why you're not
finding them here? It's not because, you
know, it's not because they don't want
to come here. It's because there is
nothing here. Unless I guess they
downloaded the citizen, but I mean
that's
it. So,
um look, I I've been on here for 10 or I
went to citizen. I'm not going to do it
cuz I probably box my location. But I
went with decision and went over the um
reports that were on within the local 5
miles of me. Maybe like 10 reports would
show up. I had a news show. This is a
tech point reporting live from my
location. Here are the 10 news stories
for today. If we gave each of them five
minutes of coverage, that is 50 minutes.
So um we still got a whole 23 hours and
10 minutes of cover finish there. So uh
yeah and according to the responses they
found their
stories from the print journalists and
then they go talk about on TV which is
fine but then again where did those
print journalists find the stories which
is enough for you to y about for 24
hours and also again where are the
journalists? So um this is week three of
our Tik Tok investigation week three of
um us you know investigating the the the
Tik Tok trends and everything like that.
haven't really found anything, you know,
but I'm not being funded at $20 million.
And for the same question, which is
where are these people that doing these
Tik Tok
dances? Uh where are the journalists? I
I've never seen a journalist actually
out doing something like are they do do
they just live among us? Are they
secretly writing that secretly writing
things down? Maybe they're using the
radio technology that no one else gets
to access. I mean, it's absolutely
ridiculous
here. Um, I guess we're going to do a
final touch on SSTW. We're gonna be
cleaning up the website, posting some
stuff out
there. Um, I follow Nika now, so I guess
I guess that means the the war is over,
you know. Oh, this might be interesting.
Let's uh let's rank each and everyone of
the Maybe we can get into some SLW
analysis in the next podcast episode.
Let's rank each and every one of the uh
SSA LTW rifles in in let's just rank
them. Not rank them from one to like S
tier at who's the best. But this is this
is rank them each on their own merits.
Right. First starting off Jamie. Jamie
was probably the worst rival of all
rivals of all time. Uh
because the the problem with Jamie was
that she created this problem. She
created SSA by rivaling uh non SSA. So,
so, so by rivaling me, which caused
problems for all these other people out
there. So, um there's that. Also, she
didn't really have a goal. She didn't
really want to take over anything. She
didn't really have a goal to like
destroy SSA once was um created. She
didn't really do much as a rifle. She
was just mean. So, uh gonna go um DT
detailed there. All right. Now on to the
next rival. Uh, seventh grade. Let's
think about this. I I forgot the name in
the essay LTW series.
But the thing
is like in terms of intelligence,
someone was smarter than Jamie. Not
smarter than Jamie. In terms of like
goal, I don't really know what the goal
was, but I mean, she was at least a
decent spy. So, uh, B2 B2. All right.
Now we have to get to the real rivals of
Nika. All right. N I K K A.
Now what would I rank? Because think
about it. Nika has created the
foundational policy of modern SSA going
into the series today, right? If you
think about it, Jamie, she didn't really
do much. She's just like the background
drop of oh well this how got founded,
right? But
Nika,
she in terms of being a
rival kind of founded the modern SSA.
Think about antichrist policy, teenage
threat to national security. All these
policies that got drawn through each and
every one of them even got brought up in
the November 9th, 2022 debate or
interview, press conference, whatever
you want to call it.
That still is the foreign policy that
was built upon it because of what
happened in 2019. Think about something
that happened in 2019 is influencing SSA
citizens in
2022. Something that happened in 2019 is
influencing SSA citizens in
2024. And in in fact, we use that same
playbook back in 2024 to defeat nth
grade.
So it even you know caused SSA defense
and SSA the antichrist defense system to
do this. And she actually had a goal.
actually didn't believe that she had a
goal which was to destroy SSA to become
a lot more powerful and more popular and
or to prevent uh SSA from being able to
get close to David and find out his
secrets. So that's two working theories
that SSA has right now still be looking
into. So I'm going to go with Sier right
there. Sier because you know it was an
actual rivalry. It actually lasted a
long time. stalemated because co and we
also did stuff like uh launch the
rockets with the whole patriotic imagery
um hearkening back to the cold war of uh
when the United States rocket drew up on
its launch.
So you know I I think that you know S2
greatest rival because you know no other
rival has ever has ever created except
for Jamie but SSA probably was going to
become a thing anyway. So has ever
actually created something that would
become SA foreign policy five six years
later down the line. So uh
congratulations uh to NA there. Now
let's go uh jump ahead to um I forgot
his name in the book but from Energizer
essentially getting SSA banned but
haven't worked
undercover. Oh, Malachi. Yeah, that's
his name. I gave her some biblical name.
Getting SSA banned. neat touch, but
like not really as rivalistic as uh
Lily, which was the presidential
candidate I ran against back in
2022, only because
uh you know, the whole debate thing, the
whole, you know, oh, he's going to like
turn this into a Christian theocracy
uh thing that
happened. So, well, she didn't pedal
that, but she's still a rival. I'm going
to go with C2 though cuz like she didn't
really pedal the misinformation that was
going to turn the school into Christian
theocracy that was of the people. Um but
I mean she didn't really do anything to
dissuade that. Um now
uh back to
Malachi getting man whatever. Like I
said undercover anything that we're
going to investigate anything. It's not
like we're going to make any money
nonetheless. But like he didn't really
do much. See too. All right. Now on to
Allison. Now not really a rival. only a
rival for one week, but you know, pretty
competent if you think about that.
Compton left to win an election, which
is pretty good. Uh B2 also, you know,
pretty good because, you know, kind of
as president setting foreign policy for
the school while SSA is out doing
things, you know, with the uh with the
unbeatable attitude, right? Like you
can't beat us, you can't take us down.
Um same thing that we transferred over
from 2022,
2023, right? But, you know, that kind of
spread over to G Cam and that kind of
yeah, didn't end up well. But, um, adds
in Tamalei, which I'm a pretty good
rival, honestly. Pretty pretty pretty
good rival. I think about it. Smacking
kids in the face of sheep,
uh, throw throwing food and sunglasses
and hydroplastic people and getting away
with it. Pretty good rival. Um, me too.
Cuz think about it. SSA was able to do a
whole bunch of stuff and get away with
it. Clone voices, uh, bug rooms, get
away with that, you know. Uh, of course
we had reasons, but you know, throwing
hydro and water bottles and um
advocating for terrorism against Denver.
Pretty good. Uh, B2. All right. Um, and
also going to give um Valerie also B as
well. Just Well, actually she's pretty
smart. Let's go. Let's go to A.
And I think that's it. Yeah. Yeah,
that's it. So, um, let's see what if we
have any questions in the chat. Nope,
that's it. So hopefully we can make Teen
Sitcoms great again. Hopefully we can
make radio make a resurgence. And
hopefully, you know, let's make Windows
better than Linux cuz Linux is trash and
disgusting and horrible and depravity.
And it's probably mentioned in Roman 8.</pre>
