<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 21525</h1>
<pre>good afternoon everybody Welcome to the
this week in the Tech booy podcast we
have so much to get to today this week
the tech booy media published two
articles on the
techboy G and we're going to be looking
over our statistics from sweet tricks to
see um how well the website has been
going we want to Pivot to a more teen
focused company we still want to um stay
close to our Christian Tech stuff Roots
but we have some interesting videos
coming down in the pipeline you might be
seeing some changes over on the techboy
.org of we're not going to lose any
features because of course we are
against losing features once you have a
feature you have to you know keep try to
keep the features that you already have
in right but um let's get over and turn
to our first item of the agenda so
yesterday was Valentine today and people
were going around and talking
about what they were getting to eat or
something I don't know but anyway
there's this viral image of um a piece
of meat here this is the image um it's
heart shaped it looks like a uh it looks
like a heart um at least from what it's
supposed to be right
and if you can't see it in the red here
this is broccoli and I replaced it with
green beans here so you might be
wondering how I did that right I don't
have Photoshop I don't pay for any
advanced photo editing um applications
the only Advanced editing application I
paid for would be Luma fusion and motion
nin which are both video editing phone
applications right I bar use this
computer um for anything which I guess
we can talk about as well all computers
truly dead right there was some article
from Fox that I was reading through from
2011 that was essentially saying the
same things I'm saying now like we're
connected to the cloud we are um with 4G
now it's 5G since we're connected to the
cloud do we really need to do
anything with a computer anymore like if
this software which is just browser
based worked via on a phone I mean it
might be better just use it on a phone
anyway because obviously the cameras are
better as you guys know two years ago um
before these podcast for live um I did
podcast episode straight from my phone
on Deck Samsung Galaxy s22 plus right
super easy um it was kind of hard to
edit a little bit though but I mean it
was completely doable and possible but
you know we're getting off topic and
tangent so anyway you download the
application photo Le which is the same
application that I use to generate
pictures of Ava Haru which is a virtual
artificial intelligence influencer
anyway then you rub out what you need
here so you uh this is in Red so you rub
over it right we wanted to keep the meat
and remove this vegetable and replace it
with the green beans here right so all I
did was um rub the vegetables um and
then type in green beans and it
generated these pictures of green beans
here and this is the best picture and I
Noti this a low quality you know oh also
one thing it does have a little water
Mark not that thing it's just whatever
uh it does have a watermark here but I
was able to erase it you might be able
to see or maybe I cropped it out
whatever you type it in there boom you
got your green beans easy peasy lemon
squeezy so make sure you guys check that
out it's a free tool photo leap um
unfortunately I think that will give use
your one AI credit per hour so used to
be five it used to be generate five
different iterations of AA if I wanted
to play around with some stuff if it's
start flagging some stuff but now I have
to rip it careful if I do that then I of
course have to wait another hour but
there are ways to get around that just
make sure you just clear the cash and
app data and then restart it again you
don't need any account and you can keep
doing unlimited generation so maybe you
shouldn't put that out there on the
internet because INF F people find out
and then they'll shut it down also it's
not committing a crime anyway you know I
wouldn't condone that all right
anyway also over on Tech boy.org the s24
ultra one one year later what what what
are we seeing from this right for Ultra
one year later it's a decent phone but
we do have a few problems so let's get
into what the s24 ultra is good at and
what it's not good at so first of all
good phone
except see this thing on the back of it
battery case
right without this case this thing this
phone probably would have died long long
time ago not from crashing or anything
it's very doable that's one of the good
things that I list about it but from
Battery like life so battery life needs
to get better on this phone doesn't
matter what software I'm running oneu I
6 one i7 beta battery life should get
better all right another thing S Pen I
can't pull it out anymore and even
though this is the last fully featured
SP pen I can't use it anymore because
it's HS grafted with glue because it got
stepped
on and yeah they need to make it easier
to get get it out of here all right not
glue but like a glue do all right the
cameras let's let's do a test right now
I'm I'm gonna see how long takes 1 1,000
2 1,000 so it took about 1 and a half
seconds to load through when I take the
picture shuttle lag is still there let's
see if there's any
blue no there's no blue but there's
still definite shter lag they're kind of
like everything just needs to be a bit
better also this is a general Android
problem you know i' like to see some
more applications some more features
come over to the devices um as they come
over hopefully Samson keeps innovating
and keeps promoting decks I can from
them in a long time and also apparently
this this problem for the people who
didn't get their oneu i7 betas on their
phones yet right CU I think enrollment
is full my your i7 sta is out it's still
not on the phones and it's not bringing
to now bar to Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra
which is just not now part the now
thingy Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra which
it's just criminal like you don't need a
dedicated npu to to tell you to we and
give you a dedicated news briefing right
we already have that in Samsung news
panel people just sometimes disabl that
we already have that just a more
advanced quotequote AI version of that
as well so hopefully Samsung gets that
fixed as well but there are great things
about the Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra right
extremely extremely durable hopefully
you guys can see this on the screen but
you know it's made out of titanium and
gorilla grass Victor 2 doable except for
the SP pen but it's doable they also
came in some neat colors I got the
titanium color I didn't want yellow but
you know Samsung did sell a green vers
and I didn't get that one
um the storage right I'm at 378 gabes
now so I should probably update that but
52 GB of storage plainly enough probably
should last me about six months maybe a
whole year until I have to start
deleting stuff some useless apps I Haven
barely use any apps anymore like it's
really sad like the internet it feel
feels like it's gotten smaller since I
was a kid right it's it feels like it's
died or whatever anyway most of the
storage is filled with podcast clips
from YouTube y yada right and it is
speced out to the max but it doesn't
really need to be speced out to the max
uh in my opinion right but for some
reason it's at runs at like 9 8.1
something depending fluctuates gigabyt
of ram just normally which is really
really weird because a few years ago 8
gigabytes of RAM was the Max still is
the max that you can get on a phone
today so if it if it wasn't an Ultra
phone right if I just had the normal s24
phone maybe just a older s23 model and
did the same stuff that I did on this
phone which is very light unless I'm
just doing the video editing it'd be
maxed out it' be slow and slugish
already right right which is honestly
ridiculous to me I do like the Galaxy Ai
and software features hopefully they
stay um you know it's going to be sad
when they put a price onto them and my
phone just becomes basically what the
s22 plus was back in 2022 which is
ridiculous you
know I I I don't
get why
those features like we paid well people
paid thousands of dollars for those
phones right of course you know they get
the carrier deals but then the carriers
have to pay thousands for those phones
as well so I really don't want these
things to become subscription
based that would not be a good thing all
right um the battery life hard for power
mode no matter what you do stream
YouTube GPS whatever stillo right now
screen issues screen gets smudged easily
like you can see this on scen it
actually looks a lot better than today
right I think it might just be the olop
phobic coding has kind of left so you
know the anti-reflective
stuff it's still decent but not as good
as it could be I he the s25 ultra is
better there also it is getting a bit
brighter now but when this article was
written yeah it was really hard to see
even outside on a DM day so maybe it's
just fluctuations with software maybe
it's just acting weird on that day maybe
it's just a software bug I don't know
but you know Samsung it is a th000 phone
a better quality control all
right let's see what Mr who's the boss
has to
say am I as we doing this let's go sign
into our sweet Trix account that's what
we use for
um statistics and let's see what our
Statistics over time has
been all right it's loading here so if
you guys can see this on the screen um
make sech up nope it's not up
yet oh man we are down we are down so
that can only mean two things that we
had a really really good week and thus
you know we're just meling out back to
normal or we had or we just like really
really falling because we only put out
two articles this week because it seems
like that more people are watching oh
this is over the last seven days so
let's do our I like the chart visit oh
great so we just had a really really
good week here but um 70 average
visitors it appears to be um February
12th being our low wait no no sorry
February 9th being our low with only 68
visitors here um our top articles of
course always the same on how to
download Instagram followers offline
chat the oh the new phone is pulling in
some numbers as well Samsung gxy M8
versus M7 finding bre set up tegram but
of course number one country English
speaking countries United States India
oh sorry UK India Canada and Philippines
each and every one of those countries I
believe used to be a British colony all
right let's see what's coming in from
Canada here um only one on February
11th I wonder who that could have
been oh there it is now let's pull that
one
Canada Chrome windows from Twitter
American English desktop t t all right
I'm going to bookmark that all right
anyway oh let's see we got some
notifications
here ah nothing nothing useful here of
you yelling at me yet anyway back to the
uh per site performance and strategy so
people aren't really reading the new
stuff that we sent out yet we just put
out new stuff because if you don't put
out new stuff then Google won't rank
your website highly and if people don't
rank a website highly then of there the
tech booy website to become high and
that won't be good now speaking of High
um Tik Tok is probably not going to be
number one back in the app store again
as has been replaced back uh it's been
put back in the Google Play stores and
Apple App Store so unfortunately need
the window for over selling overpriced
iPhones with Tik Tok installed has
[Music]
closed okay that was I I don't know what
that was anyway speaking of local news
local news has died um you know like we
like like we talked about two weeks ago
with the high school newspapers right
local news has died and I have come up
with an idea
to fix it right like you know here in
Houston like you know we all want that
adventures and odyssey exp you know have
the kids running around solving many
detective agency stories and etc etc you
know they have the local news ofor is
doing stuff right but here in Houston
right you don't have much of that or any
of that um of course you know that
affiliate like the local news Affiliates
here are owned all by you know major
Affiliates so they're going to go focus
on bit more important stories than
whatever they focused on in event n in
some of the smaller towns owned by ABC
Fox I don't who KPC is owned by but more
on the same
anyway it's own by tinga or something
anyway more of the
same
[Music]
um anyway more of the same I'm stalling
here I got to type in no there we
go I came up with this ideas um with J
gbt right I came well I came up the idea
and I wanted to see what chat GPT
thought about it chat GPT thought it was
a genius idea and I'm going to give this
idea out to anyone for free because like
I don't have the kind of money or
technological expertise to put this out
so it's a free idea guys go go implement
it just site me when it gets implemented
anyway so the idea is to have hypo local
news companies and hopefully you guys
can see this on the
screen there we go
so we have to Small Time journalism F
and Etc the idea is to have hypercal
News application divide the city depends
on how big the city is into small zones
and have local reporters and offices
that just focus primarily on those small
zones which means that whatever news
worthy that happens in those zones from
a lost dog to a game-winning touchdown
pass thrown by the quarterback on the
high school to whatever even High School
elections um missing things happening in
people's yards right just imagine
what the Timberline twins did uh you
know or do in the Red Rock Mysteries
book and radio series compared
contrasted with the adventures NY you
know 30,000
people Town reporter right and with the
real life application called citizen
which is an application that allows you
to report crimes happening nearby you um
and it gives you a live active crime map
I'm not going to show it here because
then it's going to show my location but
of of all the crimes happening around
you and if you happen to see something
happening it doesn't even necessarily
has to be a crime be like a house bur
down or something if you happen to see
something around you then you can live
stream it and the moderators can approve
it and then they will see it so I
actually have a video of me um s like
some type of car
accident
happening in progress and it's a safety
application if you pay money you can
also track your family members on there
for some reason
anyway imagine that they also have a
news feed was not that good imagine that
but you know more news worthy and also
with a little bit less moderation
wouldn't that be
interesting um wouldn't that be
interesting yes that would be
interesting in my opinion what do you
guys
think all right hope you I get some
chats in here because that's not 's not
much going on in the tech world today um
there is this huge huge story about some
woman who faked X account apparently she
had like 14 children and said children
didn't
exist so you know be careful there she
was also kind of annoying so whatever I
guess the patriarchy did fall anyway
um so
um yeah that that's what we have here
let's see what kind of videos we have
from oh Mr the boss released a new video
talking about some tech Ts that need to
die I don't know how I
missed that
video you know I used to get
notifications of them let's see what the
tech TS need to die also I missed my
headphones welcome to the 13 most tragic
Tech fails ever he has he has those
black roses just like uh that person in
Advent and Ary from the Clark Tower uh I
forgot jilted roses yeah that's what
they're called products and companies so
Dreadful that they died an instant death
and need to be buried 6 ft under let's
commemorate them beautiful service isn't
it and it all starts with GoPro also I
do like how his screen he's finally he
has a nice you know kind of creepy um
Halloween esque not that I canone
Halloween Evangelical base is going to
yell at me but whatever
I'm it's not like I'm running for
president yet anyway um we got the
background here with the trees and we
even have the I think there's a cemetery
plots if you look kind of closely in the
background so I am glad that he's U
utilizing his his screen to not just
show like his logo I mean the screen
cost more than a house
$200,000
so you know he might as well make some
money in 2024 decided to release the her
hero 4K their cheapest ever action
camera at $199 literally half the price
of the flagship hero 13 black looks like
it's a piece of plastic also you can get
a action camera for like $60 you know
VTEC has the kitty zoom action camera
too as well for like $60 it's for kids
but it's a nice idea I'd say most of
gopro's current users are enthusiasts
willing to SN a lot of money into their
extreme adventurous Hobbies so the GoPro
4K was the company's way of GoPro still
in business like you s One camera okay
it's good didn't work pricing themselves
to be affordable to the masses you know
the people who just want to go pro on a
walk the problem though is that to hit
this 199 price they had to scale back
key features I feel like I've used
microwaves with better looking
interfaces than this and massively
reduce the video and stabilization
quality and nowadays you don't have to
reduce that quality by very much until
it is quite literally worse than the
camera that everyone is already carrying
around in their pocket anyway I mean to
be honest forget the iPhone 16 Pro max
if we just take an iPhone 30 even with
this the iPhone is still significantly
better quality let's see like he does
get look a bit more washed out of course
you know iPhone 13 is still $500 so
maybe this is for kids but then still
you have the tech thingy
[Music]
um I don't know I kind of like the
saturation on the back of the screen
better on the hero 4K but it's not as
realistic and also you don't want to
strap that thing to your head not
because of you know ways but because of
you know if you're strapping a 500 oh my
gosh you can't even see this you know if
you can't if you're strapping a $500
phone to your head you know you it's
probably gonna fall off and it's also
gonna be top heavy so it's
not
yeah not to mention like a 100 times
easier because you're not having to faff
around with SD cards and top it off the
hey SD cards are actually good and they
turn not to the iPhone but to the
Samsung
I phone still has an action mode which
turns out is actually better than the
GoPro stabilization so this thing is not
useful for the people who wouldn't
normally be interested in action cameras
yeah but you're not gonna again like I
said you're not going to strap that to
your head right action cameras are meant
you know kind of like put it put it on
your camera on your body and like slide
down water slides and it's not good
enough for the people who already care
about action cameras making it basically
Dead on Arrival I don't get this like
again how no one's going to buy an
iPhone 13 and get jump into a water
paret well okay no same person is going
to buy an iPhone 13 and film
themselves jumping into like a water
park with it some influencer might do
that see how many iPhones I can get wet
before they die or maybe some insane
person just doesn't care about their
phone like that but no non influencer
samee person is going to do that one out
of 10 Tech fail but if you thought GoPro
had cornered the market on trying to
please everyone and actually in the
process pleasing no one then you might
have forgotten about Sonic since Sonic 3
has come out
Sonic Sonic Matt Walsh and um history V
about to get um upset some someone's
gonna get upset here let's see what
Sonic has to say actually Sonic Sonic's
on Prime so we might actually to be able
to watch that and I'm so glad that the
person who won Beast games wasn't some
annoying person I mean finally decent
person that's Beast games insane and
we're all used to how he looks now in
the movies feels like a good time to
remind everyone about that initial
trailer oh my God people were he looks
like a blue Hedgehog outraged that this
is how their beloved childhood Hedgehog
friend was why his leg so long but okay
portrayed The Uncanny Valley humanlike
proportions the weird space eyes the
teeth I can what's wrong with him he's a
hedgehog he looks fine to me guarantee
those teeth will have appeared in
children's nightmares across the globe
the reaction was so strong that
Paramount decided to make a massive
publicly embarrassing U-turn announcing
that they would redesign and reanimate
Sonic from scratch which cost them an
estimated $5 million and delayed the
movie by a full 3 months oh so the movie
already come out okay also you know a
guy he very fast in know got to go not
so fast here's the interesting twist if
we were in the Paramount boardroom at
the time this was happening we'd have
been freaking out about the now soiled
reputation of our company but this is
one of those rare Tech fails in which
the company saw what they did wrong they
suppressed their ego they apologized and
they managed to still win from the
situation by he just looks like a
cartoon character now and he just a
video game I don't know I don't I don't
worship even care that much about Sonic
the only son game I know is that when we
collect the wings on Kindle fixing it at
their own cost like that $5 million
investment played I'm sure a massive
part in this movie going on to gross
$149 million at the US Canada box office
completely flipping Paramount's
reputation into them being the heroes
and even spawning two sequels where they
brought in Tails Knuckles and even
shadow in the same style that fans now
happily accepted pushing the franchise
past the $1 billion Mark worldwide so
again can't really give this more than
okay that's great maybe it was
intentional you know to get some
marketing and one out of 10 fail but now
things start to get real somber this is
Moxy the 800 oh yes Moxy rest in peace
Moxy $ emotional support AI robot for
children which in itself is already one
of the stranger sentences I've said this
year so the idea of Moxy is interesting
at the very least it was designed by a
bunch of neuroscientists and Child
Development Specialists to basically
help parents to teach their kids social
skills oh nice okay so kids would
interact with it they're specifically
meant to form a close bond with it and
the thing was pretty Advanced it used a
proprietary mix of AI Technologies
including chat gbt to regulate its
facial expressions depending on the tone
of the conversation and it could also
for proprietary really I read some book
about robotics back in like 2014 where
they had of robot
which you know if a GU in a book was
even older than that that could have
facial expressions
so okay so store up to four profiles so
that its interactions with different
kids in the same household are all
unique but then just about the worst
thing that could possibly happen
happened embodied the startup behind
Moxy sent out an email announcing that
the bot is shutting down leaving the
parents with the J problem
with Cloud technology if he had sh down
you can't get it back which is
unfortunate of gently explaining to
their very young children why their best
friend is disappearing answer because
the company failed to secure additional
funding but this was heartbreaking stuff
to the kids who basically had to watch
their friend die since because it's
using cloud-based servers once the
servers are shut down the robots can't
function oh yeah and that's crazy just
put a r by it no refunds is what they
said but the icing on the casket in this
poetic St opian Blade Runner esque twist
the final shutdown email also included
suggestions on how parents should break
the news to their now devastated
children yeah this product backfired so
hard two out of 10 fail so there's a
good chance that you've heard of a
pretty successful steam deck probably
the most mean stream handheld gaming
I've actually only seen it like once or
twice also you know I wonder if you can
actually do stuff on it like yeah you
can play video games on it but can you
actually do something productive I I
don't know what you could do with the
computer that you can't do on a phone
anymore but
still like I Okay computer ever but did
you know the steam deck wasn't actually
the company's first attempt to a console
see in 2015 there were two primary types
of Gamers there were the PC games who
got the highest end Graphics as well as
cheaper games with free online play but
they that Meme come from some
kid is that from that movie where clip
where live stream upstairs inside the
bedroom bunch of idiots anyway to sit
upright at a desk and then there were
the console Gamers who got to lay back
on a couch but had a lesser gaming
experience you do realize that you can
pair wireless remote to your computer
right and I'm not even a game mode but
I'm pretty sure it's technologically
feasible you put it you get a wireless
remote PIR it to your computer and then
put the computer onto a monitor
and then you can lay down on the
couch
so um it doesn't seem like there's any
reason to have a console according to
just
logic due to a lack of console power
enter the Steam Machines the idea was to
offer people the power of the PC with
the convenience of the console
so you can just plug you know you can
plug your
PC into the TV and use a y remote how is
this
hard valve the company behind steam
created this brand new very unique
controller with two clickable touchpads
for Mouse like controls and they
partnered with a bunch of PC vendors you
know companies like Alienware to offer
buyers a number of different spec
options so each of these Ste machines
was like a normal PC just instead of
running Windows because Windows was
designed for mouse and keyboard and even
to this day you can't properly navigate
with a controller and because the CEO of
valve spe
you
can't I'm pretty sure like there's so
many windows There Goes My Phone Windows
runs on ATMs for crying out loud I'm
pretty sure someone could have figure
out the skin to get it to run Windows
and you can run your windows games like
normal people like them to run I don't
know what games people play but I know
Windows is the number one gaming
OS specifically hated the Windows 8 that
was out at the time calling it a
catastrophe for everyone in the PC space
didn't put it on Windows 7 or just wait
was 2015 just wait for Windows 10 what's
wrong with these people I mean for
goodness sake we have government systems
that I could log into right now that are
running Windows 7 and I wouldn't log
into them because that probably would be
criminal but if some L actor wanted to
they could so these machines ran on the
new self-developed linux-based Steam OS
the problem was that the vast majority
of games designed for Windows couldn't
actually run on
these duh how
who okay I've tried to run Windows
programs on Linux before you know for my
Chromebook and on my phone it
is near impossible near impossible I'm
like hey guys yeah we got win you think
gamers are gonna want that okay game if
um they miss like one shot or if someone
like interrupts their gameplay are going
to go like crash out and start raging
like isn't that like there's one guy on
stream that
goes if something goes wrong with them
like and you wanted them to have to run
Linux you want them to have to try to
run Linux and try to get their Windows
games Support over absolutely ridiculous
fire whoever was the R&D manager only
about 20% of the library of games on
Steam could actually run on the steam
machines and even the games that did run
ran slower since they've been primar was
these games that you kind of like oh is
this really fun to people optimized four
Windows first and to top the whole thing
off in a cruel twist of fate Windows 10
dropped only a few months before the
first steam machines actually started
shipping which fixed a lot of the issues
that people were having with Windows 8
and it was a free upgrade for like the
first time ever making the
steam yeah I mean they didn't know that
Windows was going to come out I I'm sure
Microsoft would have told them they
could have even released it as their
first PC game console right maybe just
brought some xer and maybe Xbox would
have helped him out but you know Xbox
has their own games anyway so Microsoft
like yeah Microsoft probably would
helped him out sad machines very quickly
run out of steam rest in PC made only
slightly more bearable by the fact that
this failure was essential for the newer
steam deck to have been a success since
it led the company to develop a
compatibility layer called proton which
is what allows Windows games to now run
smoothly on Linux what about um
nine games on gaming though does anyone
remember that time when Elon Musk
claimed to be one of the world's top 20
Diablo 4 players on Joe Rogan's podcast
and then when people checked he actually
surprisingly was on the leader board I
mean if I spent as much of my day-to-day
on X as musk does then I reckon I'd have
to be some sort of demigod of innate
gamer skill to also have a career as
busy as his and be that good at any game
let alone something as insane inanely
time consuming isn't Diablo just like
that game you can play on when no that's
Doom never mind as Diablo anyway fast
forward a couple of months on the 7th of
January this year Elon streamed himself
playing Path of Exile 2 which is another
hack and slash RPG game that's pretty
Diablo likee and as you'd expect from
gamer deity Elon Musk his character was
insanely maxed out he literally had gear
better than streamers whose entire job
was to play this game all day huh that's
nice but I guess that makes sense since
just a few days earlier he tweeted
boasting about how his hardcore
character had made it to number 59 in
the world he is actually so good at this
game that his account was online while
he was sitting at Trump's inauguration
how does he do it well you know what
didn't make sense the game itself to
Elon people immediately got suspicious
because he had all of this absolutely
insane gear but when he was live
streaming he was acting like someone who
literally never played the game before
like for examp interesting completely
IGN in a chaos orb one of the rarest
currencies in the game he keeps trying
to pick up an item despite having a full
inventory you get the sense that he
doesn't understand why his click isn't
doing anything Elon confuses item level
with required level causing what is this
game it kind of looks like a looks like
a
map that
um like it looks like a map from like
some
2014 you have a booking him to lament
that his unbelievably busted top Tier
gear is only level 62 but by far my
favorite most daming and just allout
cringe offense on the stream he only
plays maps from a folder clearly titled
elon's Maps which can only mean one of
two things one that he has paid someone
to play this account for him and they're
the ones who've set aside some easy maps
for him to play on stream so that he
doesn't get annihilated while bragging
to the world about how he wishes he
could make the game harder he literally
did that by the way or two Elon just
decided to actually name his map folder
after himself yeah I go with number two
which to be honest might actually just
be even worse so anyway the internet
pretty quickly figured it out and Elon
admitted in DMS to YouTube and Nik rex
that he had been having someone else
boost his account and he did also
confirm that he was the one playing on
those streams but we got that part I
mean end it is just a video game but
there's just something so tragic about
how incredibly 1,000% his own fault this
is like it's a total massively public
self-own for one of the most famous
people on the planet thankfully we can
all rest assured that at least that was
the worst thing that he did all week
right but enough hating the player it's
time to hate the game do you remember
OverWatch OverWatch was s what that such
a fun hero shooter it was so instantly
accessible every character was so unique
and interesting and the world they lived
in was so engaging that even people who'
never picked up a shooter before were
playing this game I remember the hype
every time they teas reminds me of that
game we kind of have to shoot the
um Road Rift
paint release of the character doomfist
the way they embedded the law of his
character within the core gameplay and
this level of imersion is why the one
thing that the entire fan base was
clamoring for was just a campaign mode
something with a bit of a campaign mode
actual storytelling as opposed to just
having random Heroes go head-to-head
over and over again online so imagine
the hype levels when the trailer for
OverWatch 2 dropped at BlizzCon 2019 a
brand new game with a c oh I think I
remember this I didn't see the trailer
but the um I think I remember or was in
California I I remember hearing about
this pain story mode being one of the
main focuses and then when it came to
release in 2022 blizzard announced that
they'd also be shutting down the
original OverWatch a couple of days
before number two drops which some
people did not love understandably but
hey I figured that if number two is
everything that it's hyped up to
then this is all just adding to the
anticipation for that sudden go moment
then it launched and it was a disaster
for a start you could not get on the
game was hit with a Dos attack on launch
basically that's not their fault
overload on the servers for which the
company was totally unprepared for so
for the vast majority of players the
game was literally unplayable lots of
people stuff from OverWatch one the
Skins the currency had vanished in the
process of merging accounts with number
two you had to Quee to play which
happens in these types of games but
sometimes behind 40,000 people in this
case the list goes on all of which maybe
would have been forgivable if the game
was actually good but it's just
basically the same thing except now
battles were five versus 5 instead of 6
versus 6 okay so now I have even less
friends and then on top of that they'd
added a dreaded battle pass they'd
bumped up the prices on Cosmetics
including a charm that worked out to
cost more in game than the real life
version that blizzard sells
I always wonder how it feels like if
you're if if you know if you're ever
inside of a game stream like what if
what if you're inside of a stream that
would be kind of interesting you just
can't make this stuff up and they made
it so hard to earn new characters that
you basically had to pay for them which
immediately creates an uneven playing
field which is like the primary
stabilizing force of an online game like
this people were so anguished that over
90% of the reviews on Steam were
negative this was the lowest rated steam
game of all time and so it feels like at
this point blizzard just decided you
know what we screwed it up anyway you
remember that campaign mode that we
talked about you know the main new thing
that OverWatch 2 was made for yeah well
we're not making it anymore and as if
they needed it it feels like the new
Marvel Rivals game has just been the
nail in the coffin a similar game that
seems to have isn't Marvel Rivals that
game that redit Echo Chambers likes
learned from overwatch's lessons and has
single-handedly stolen a further 39% of
the game's player base in the chat for
OverWatch but now we go from fixing what
ain't broke to fixing nothing at all
this is the monumentally done called the
Spotify thing no C thing 2022 Spotify
car thing which I don't understand how
it broke and what it's running it's
running Linux is running Android and yes
that's its real name so you whack one of
these in your car specifically a car
that doesn't already have Bluetooth or
an entertainment display and this gives
you full access to Spotify that can be
controlled with both touch but why
we have these things called radios
people people like what does people
people not listen to the radio
anymore isn't there some whole song
about listening to songs on the radio
and voice commands which actually sounds
kind of nice and to look at I won't lie
to you this is this is one sexy piece of
Hardware daddy chill so I'm not
surprised that over 2 million people
signed up for the initial wait list also
this really is just a fantastic feeling
not I don't know how else to say it but
then it launched it was
$89.99 you had to have a Spotify Premium
subscription to buy one why the
interface was trash and kind of laggy
for a lot of people voice commands work
well about as well as voice commands
normally work I mean this feels like a
pretty good example of my point the
lights are on and nobody's home but more
fundamentally it turns out that the car
thing didn't play music on its own this
is just a controller for the Spotify app
that you already have on your phone so
you could just got speakers which can
already be controlled by your voice and
then factor in that the only people this
is potentially maybe useful for are
people driving older cheaper cars that
don't have an inbuilt way to play music
from your phone are those the people
that are going to want to pay $90 plus a
subscription to add a completely by that
by that let see $90 plus how much
Spotify cost you use that for a few
years you could have you know saved up
and bought a new car unnecessary extra
step into their music listening process
so Spotify slash the price to $49.99 and
then they slashed it again to $30 just a
few weeks later they really were out
here just digging deeper and deeper into
their own grave because you know Tech
fails well enough at this point to know
that it gets even worse because then in
May 2024 Spotify announced that they
would be ending support for the car
thing by the end of the year does that
mean they become car nothing oh and uh
no refunds sucks sorry not sorry cry
about it Spotify probably they'd offer
people a few months of free premium if
you reached out and specifically
complained about it but that just felt
like a slap in the face really and they
even offered some refunds on the
download for people who are really
persistent but they never came out and
made that open to the public kind of
crazy sneaky so that same month
customers filed a class action lawsuit
against Spotify for bricking the devices
they paid for alleging that they would
not have purchased the device if they'd
known Spotify was going to pull the plug
on them within only a few months also
how does it pull the plug if it's just
like a Bluetooth controller for the uh
interface for the you know Spotify app
on your phone makes total sense so there
was a hardware screw up from a company
well respected for their software well
the Sonos app redesign in May 2024 was
the exact opposite and it was a lot
worse the company completely overhauled
their
app kind Google Android IOS app and the
idea was to swap out the tabed
navigation system to a customizable home
screen layout basically to put
everything at the old app looks worse
when how is this better fingertips
speeding up your use of the interface
which if you've ever had the pleasure of
using the Sonos app before sounded like
a much needed thing and well it did make
the app faster but it's just that people
very quickly at launch realized that
while they could get to a lot of their
stuff more readily some of the most
fundamental features like the sleep
timer along editing the music queue or
you know for many people actually being
able to find their speakers not small
things that find you how do you lose a
speaker in your house easily missed we
just gone and if you were visually
impaired the app was just completely
blocked off for you because it didn't
even launch with any kind of screen
reader capability remember this isn't
just a Speaker Company who launched an
app the app is the company Sonos
speakers are nothing without it so
naturally Reddit had an absolute field
de with this people who' built their
entire homes using Sonos Tech were
fuming there was a mass call for people
to boycott
fuming okay like yes I get it if you're
vision and bu that's not good but you
can e EAS built that in but for the
other R you have nothing else to do you
don't like the way the app works so
you're not going to like what protest
outside of their um outside of their
headquarters like bone bone it you
people have nothing nothing better to do
with your time good great caught the
brand and abandoned them for
Alternatives how did Sonos respond well
they were brave enough to tell people
that the app redesign really just took
courage which I mean I guess the courage
to kill your company I know what I have
to do but I don't know if I have the
strength to do it as You' kind of expect
then Revenue shot down 8% year-over-year
in Q4 earnings which Sonos themselves
attributed to the app roll out $4
million was apparently just spent on app
recovery Investments they had to delay
their next two Hardware launches just to
get this thing under control and in
totality The company took a $500 million
hit 500 million is insane to their
valuation damn this was released almost
a year ago the company is still trying
to put out the fires it started and make
up with customers I mean Sonos actually
created a public Trello board just to
show users where they're at in the fix
pipeline how bad does it have to get for
this to happen they've opened up their
support lines on the weekends almost
like they put themselves in detention
and on January 13th CEO Patrick Spence
announced that he would step down from
the company largely because of this
deserving I think of an even bigger you
could buy his own stack six out of 10
fail but now it's time for for the top
five so Fitbit has been making Fitness
tracking watches for quite a while now
but they only made their first proper
Smartwatch in 2017 the Fitbit ionic with
its own operating system and app
platform I wish
that we brought cameras back to watch us
you know that's another remove feature
that we've seen Samsungs have them now
they remove them so
sad about 1.7 million were sold
worldwide but oh also unboard music you
know Samsung had these headphones back
in 2016 Bluetooth but you could also
have onboard music or even podcast
whatever now they don't have that
anymore so sad it's core it was
obviously still a Fitbit Fitness tracker
so if you wanted one of these bad boys
it's because you're ready to feel the
burn Unfortunately they turned out to be
a little too good at that oh I just got
eight steps from 2018 to 2020 The Firm
received numerous reports of the ionic
watches overheating while in use while
they were on people's wrists and we're
not just talking hot enough that people
had to take them off hot enough that it
was burning people's skin off second and
even third degree burns in some cases
third degree burns are serious business
often needing surgical treatment so what
did Fitbit do recall the product nope
contact the US consumer product safety
commission like they're legally mandated
to nope they um issued a firmware update
to potentially reduce the strain on the
battery just in case that helped with
any temperature escalations okay and it
did not the list of victims kept growing
it took until March 2022 so 4 years
after the report started and 115 victims
later before Fitbit actually issued the
recall they were initially meant to and
as a result Fitbit has recently been
very deservedly fined the grand sum of
$12.25 million as a civil penalty so
you've heard of bumble right the dating
app where women have to message first it
was found that in 24 don't they also
have a fringe app
too 14 by a lady called Whitney wolf
herd after she quit Tinder and the idea
was Bumble represented a safer more
chill option for women who now have more
agency and be less likely to just
immediately have their DMS flooded with
unsolicited anatomical photography and
the concept couldn't women just flood
men's DMS as well but
sure massively took off actually
surpassing even Tinder in terms of
downloads in the US so clearly this
unique selling point has been working
for them so far why fix what aim broke
well wolf herd they're actually called P
but
gone that was a bad joke what stepped
down a CEO in January 2024 being
succeeded by the then CEO of slack
lydian Jones and under her leadership in
April was a woman nice Bumble had a
fumble they went through a redesign
which added a feature that allowed men
to message first specifically in
response to pre-written questions but
still isn't that against the entire
point and this was paired with one of
the strangest marketing campaigns I have
ever seen massive Billboards telling
women that if they gave up on dating
they' become nuns wait
what ever seen massive bill was paired
with one of the strangest marketing
campaigns I have ever seen massive
Billboards telling women thou shalt not
give up
um um okay that if they gave up on
dating they'd be nuns and that they
shouldn't be celibate I feel like it
takes a special kind of mind to come up
with this stuff after which of course
Bumble had to publicly apologize and the
worst part of it is that the not yes
Instagram
apologies the best the very best
Confidence from these very obvious
blunders has led to bumble's share price
dropping by nearly half since the CEO
changed for a company this massive that
is the biggest single dropin value that
we've seen so far in this video around
$700 million is just evaporated which is
probably why in a move that looks pretty
desperate Bumble has announced that wolf
herd will now return again as well you
know yeah I mean she the other woman
should have been fired CEO in March I
would make a joke about the Bumble Hive
still needing their Queen be back but
really I think this is just a case of
not choosing people who make bad
decisions and now another app that was
trying to Deone the king except
potentially with even worse
execution let's talk about meta's
threads this app was exactly the right
thing at exactly the right time it
launched in July 2023 as a direct
competitor to the text based social
media Twitter at the exact yeah well w w
and
also the guardian the EU suck s point
where people's enthusiasm in Twitter was
at its lowest Elon Musk had just started
steering the platform towards his uh
vision and people were pretty bummed by
m layoffs the monthly payment now
required to be verified completely
defeating the point of verification in
the first place hey hey hey you know we
made some money well I haven't people
made some money like Tiffany f as well
as the hugely reduced moderation and so
it's pretty hard to describe just how
much wait CNN has their
own uh
affiliate huh much this app exploded
threads was the fastest growing app in
history think about this number for a
second 70 million signups in the first 2
days threads looked guaranteed to become
the next big thing we even made a video
talking about how big of a deal it
should have been but it turns out meta
didn't release this app at the time that
they did because it just so happened to
be fully polished and ready to go at
that time they released it specifically
to capitalize on all this drama with
Twitter which meant that while they
could and they did get to the users they
couldn't keep them the app wasn't done
yet there were no trending topics which
are like the guiding force of a more
news-based app like this there were no
hashtags the ability for Trends to
spread there was no search which just
made it feel incredibly aimless and the
problem with being so similar to Twitter
is that if you don't beat the bird
you've lost to the bird no one really
wants two separate platforms that they
have to juggle to post the exact same
content on you just want one place that
you know the other people that you want
to reach are also on and since threads
didn't do enough to overtake Twitter to
become the default option for this it's
initially triumphant users just slowly
surely trickled back to where they came
from now don't get me wrong threads
hasn't completely disappeared it gets
around 100 million daily active users
but then considering that it got 100
million signups in the first 5 days it's
clearly got a very uphill battle if it
wants to take out Twitter or x 8 out of
10 fail just considering how meteoric
threads' Beginnings were but now at
position number two the most atrocious
fail so far the vertical farming startup
bowy
oh is that like Hydroponics I two form
like that now just listen to the
magnitude of the claims this company was
making they said that their indoor
vertical Farms were over a 100 times
more productive than really
so
100 so let's say your coin field produ
is like
100,000 you're going to have millions
and millions of coin in one building
that's in traditional Farmland per
square foot because they could stack
layers and layers of crops on top of
each other and also they would use 95%
less water due to their smart farming
system Lally this kind of aesthetic
style you have your little whoever's
going in and filming it you know
it's it's interesting powered by their
own operating system BOS which used AI
to off a farm operating system okay for
individualized attention for all the
thousands of crops in each Farm facility
the idea was just that this was such a
controlled and such an optimized
environment that not a thing was going
to waste their products were insanely
expensive like bow spring mix cost $16
at Whole Foods $16 for some
salad I'm gr my own salad for that
compared to the own brand at $6 but they
were advertised as pesticide free
absurdly flavorful and I don't care what
free it is unless is coming with some
gold bars baked into it no one's going
to buy salad for 16 16 $ for a
salad but it come from a
restaurant and people were clearly
buying into it this became an enormous
company valued at $2.3 billion at its
peak now a lot of B success was down to
their closed loop irrigation system
meaning that the water in the facility
was being continually recycled and
reused which also allowed them to score
big in the kosher Foods Market as it
kept out insects which would break
kosher standards however that closed
loop system ended up becoming the very
reason for their their downfall because
when the Farms were hit by a Plante
eating pathogen in 2023 it spread like
wildfire you're still alive oh I I
thought they failed and was Ty a scam
every plant was so close together and
while all of them using the same water
is great when that water's clean it also
means that the moment one plant becomes
contaminated it's going to pass to every
plantet bow scrambled investing all the
money they could into separating the
plants and trying to recover from this
situation but ultimately the financial
strain was too great they very suddenly
seized operations in November 2024 so
suddenly in fact that produce trucks
were still arriving at facilities after
the irrigation systems have been shut
off forever it's not often that we can
say the reason for a tech failed is
because the product literally died N9
out of 10 it actually did what they said
I thought it was actually going to be
some type of scam or they found out like
no this doesn't work but I mean at least
they did what they set out to do and
fail and on the subject of farming
you've probably heard about honey at
this point this company has sponsored PR
ically every big YouTuber including me
which will bother me for a very long
time the premise was simple it's a
browser extension that adverti itself as
giving you practically free money
because it would search the web for
coupon codes when you're checking out in
an online store and apply the best one
that it can find pretty genius idea
especially since even when it doesn't
find a code you basically think oh well
at least I know that that's the cheapest
that I can get this thing with a premise
like that honey was obviously a success
I mean I used it fairly regularly for 2
years or so so much so that it was
acquired by PayPal in 2020 for 4 billion
when's this oh 2019 oh I accidentally
muted it 6 years ago but everything came
crashing down in December 24 when
YouTuber Mega lag made an expose video
about them alleging that honey steals
money from people I guess the whole free
money tagline wasn't wrong in a sense so
here's the thing a lot of content
creators they rely on revenue from
affiliate links and the majority of
these links work by giving a small cut
from the total value of a sale to the
site that do affiliate links as well
once you check out our website no one
clicks them but you know at least we try
the last click that led to that sale
what honey was doing is if you let's say
clicked on your favorite creators
affiliate link to support them and then
you used honey at checkout to get the
latest coupon whether or not it actually
found you that coupon honey was swapping
out that Creator's affiliate link for
their own honey affiliate link thus
stealing the Creator's cut of the end
sale amount which I mean it's bad but I
I was always wondering
companies you know would make
money so they've literally been paying
all of these influencers to promote them
while taking money out of their back
pockets it's it's like it's so crazy
that it sounds made up and it somehow
gets worse they've also been lying to
Consumers meal lag found that in many
cases honey would provide inferior codes
when better ones were available online
and you might think that this just means
honey isn't very good at finding them
but no we now know that they're doing it
deliberately because a honey represented
ative has actually gone on the record on
a podcast about working with businesses
to give them more
control just sad sad sad over what
coupon codes to find it literally lets
you control like the customer Journey
convert and control like the discount
code percentage as well so essentially
they're advertising themselves to
Consumers as a way to save money while
advertising themselves to businesses as
a way to stop consumers saving money it
is a pretty grave situation and as
expected The Fallout has been enormous
Mega lag's video is on 16 million views
and Counting honey has lost all
credibility and the chance to work with
many YouTubers like we're not going near
it ever again and to top it all off
YouTube's favorite snappily dressed
lawyer legal legal has fired a class
action lawsuit against
dang insane all
right I see any chats no no chats oh we
have to talk about one more thing and
then we'll be leaving SS ltw
l. blogspot.com we finally finished up
our Saga we're only one day behind real
time now so the story is set
2024 uh February 14th I should make a
graph of this like used to be ahead of
real time now behind it by one day so
we're trying to catch up trying to
finish it up because we have more things
coming down and uh we'll focus on more
website here but here you know we
sanction gcam for the failures to
operate
um yep so gcam got sanctioned and we go
work with President Allison and ver go
check that out and we're going to see
how isolationism caused gcam to crumble
and collapse and how SSA pivots towards
jaila ISM all right um God bless Tech
talk to you later</pre>
