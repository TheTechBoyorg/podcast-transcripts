<h1>Podcast 5 10 25</h1>
<pre>hello everybody welcome to the This Week at the Techboy podcast we have so much information to get to today this week
0:05
the Tech Boy created a new software program that allows you to be able to download the transcripts of any YouTube
0:10
video as well as redesigned the Tech Boy website hopefully you guys like it we're
0:15
still working on it it's work in progress and you know let's um also there's some
0:21
more information about um teen uh teen Instagram teen Tik Tok and that full um
0:27
long investigation that we've been going on to here you know we've sent out messages to all the Tik Tok dancing people over on Insta Talks_123 have not
0:35
received any responses back um so um no podcast appearance for them um yet but hopefully we will be getting one of them
0:41
on stream soon hopefully maybe we can find some random person Tik Tok in real life you know like I said I haven't seen
0:47
one in real life so you know if there is one in real life we will go out there and go um uh interview them and as part
0:53
of our teens as teens series we released two new videos at least uh that became very popular very controversial so we
1:00
did a clip of the Linux video where I basically bashed Linux and the Linux community for being a whole bunch of um
1:06
trash people as well as a trash operating system and the comments were well you know the comments were the comments um in my YouTube section so
1:13
thank you guys for that engagement all bad but you know the comments were the comments and also you guys loved my video almost at a thousand views as of
1:19
time of recording on how to um have your own RF spy bug and you know I think this goes to show that a the tech boy is
1:26
going to be transitioning even more into a um spy themed tech company it's also
1:31
going to be showing that you people are actually out there you guys want to know about these these kind of um spy um
1:37
tools you have been around for far too long wondering you know about these stupid Wi-Fi like cameras from like Timu
1:45
or something right these stupid Wi-Fi cameras when you actually want to know about the real 2.4 gigahertz remote
1:50
cameras and how to access them on a computer so you know I'm going to continue to do this research so that we can find the best spy solutions for you
1:58
um I promise you for that as well this is also an election episode because
2:03
we're going to be comparing the um Courtney for president versus um Shannon in Adventure Odyssey versus um Lucio
2:10
Monitor versus Cindy the Valley Girl or Valley Lizard from Kids Corner so lots
2:16
of things to get into today and we have two new SSLW articles coming down the line we're going to be analyzing SSLW's
2:22
foreign policy and in the case of high school geopolitics and what if what would happen if um these things happen
2:28
what would happen if Ethan Jay won the election what would happen if GM came together um before November 17th what
2:34
would happen if GM didn't even exist so you know those are examples of some of the questions I'm going to be asking here what if Su became president who
2:40
knows um so you know hopefully SSLW is not a dead brand in fact we hope to keep it
2:46
into a new a new brand in fact we this week created the first printed version of the SSA LTW book and um the person
2:53
who received it really enjoyed it said it was great so that's an endorsement uh Denver approved all right um that's
2:59
basically what we need to get into for today so without further ado we're going to get into the techro.org's headlines
3:06
um from the techboy.org website all right so hopefully you guys can see this on the screen hopefully you guys like
3:12
our new redesign um you know it is a bit I guess more fluffy but it it's it's a
3:19
bit more um I guess uh straight and to the point so we still have our most popular
3:25
articles they're not top of the page anymore that's still here so the this the first five most popular articles um
3:31
on the site here and then we have the newest articles um here as well um we
3:36
still kept drift our theme or orange kind of yellowish theme and maybe I should change this logo to of course be
3:42
transparent and be the orange logo because like I said we're going to be still having our orange logo still be in
3:48
our advertising and in our marketing just not not as much because we're super super super duper bright all right so
3:53
here is the um article so how to take neat ASCI pictures on your phone there's
3:58
this application um
4:04
called it should be linked wow I forgot to link the
4:11
application name in here so the application is called ASCI Cam it
4:18
is just a picture of a camera with the black icon on it and as you can see this is a screenshot of what the thing looks
4:25
like that's actually my laptop right there so you know it's really interesting because you can see how all
4:31
your I guess devices would appear if they were in ASCI um format which is you
4:37
know obviously these numbers here which is representing via an image is using uh Linux terminals as well so it's a neat
4:43
little art style there they don't allow videos but the same company does allow um have a device application called
4:50
Vector Cam which does allow videos and does give uh not this kind of style but does give some sort of a nice unique
4:56
style as well so make sure you guys um check those applications out it may say that it's not compatible if it's not
5:01
then just make sure that you have the uh you know the YouTube channel and I'm just gonna check
5:08
to make sure
5:13
that All right great yes it does so um if you don't have it just make sure that you um are able to get it
5:19
from uh an APK uh file and it runs perfectly well on my Samsung Galaxy S20
5:27
uh for Ultra so it's going to run well on run well on best or latest versions of Android Android uh when you're 7.0
5:34
all right now how to download YouTube transcripts in bulk this is the program that um I'm most excited for because I
5:40
developed this by myself with Gemini and it perfectly works in fact I got 133 transcripts on my computer um just from
5:49
my podcast as well now the one problem with this um program is that not a
5:56
problem with the program but the problem is that it um what's the word
6:02
when I merged all the transcript files together they I I tried to search
6:08
through my podcast transcripts to find all like the controversial and funny things that I say and AI did not do a
6:13
good job um of of doing that so um I'm I'm still trying to use this to find um clips that I can use of my channel you
6:19
know we have over hundreds of uh hundreds of articles on this as well so 43 people have only viewed this which
6:25
I'm actually kind of shocked because the YouTube transcript downloader industry is actually very very uh big it's also
6:30
very very trash right the reason I decided to do a desktop application instead of a web application is I'm not
6:36
going to pay for all those stupid server costes well of course I'm more pro desktop application than I am web application and it's just
6:43
like there's this other competing program it's $9.99 a month to get your
6:48
YouTube transcript downloaders in bulk this one does it in bulk for $5 right now it's on sale for 99 um so if you
6:54

7:07
demo of the program i can't do a live demo not because it doesn't work but because um you'll see it shows um my
7:13
real computer's username and everything like that we don't want to you know accidentally dox myself so um here is a
7:19

regular price all right so that is um that is the program that we created with co-created with Jim and I was able to um
9:11
figure it out we was able to get the um compile it here on my computer as well no external help as well so um hopefully
9:18
you guys check out this program uh it's probably one of the tech boys greatest accomplishments um in my opinion i mean
9:23
we did a uh we did we did multiple books we've done a website but now we have our
9:29
own computer program our own physical product and we are working on porting it over from Windows to Android as well and
9:35
I'm actually starting to see why people like to use web apps but nope we're not going to turn this into web app this is going to be a one time purchase thing um
9:42
where you can get into this and you know speaking of software we're not going to have a whole segment about this today because I am busy um NCH software
9:49
actually makes interesting um software suite um for Windows and for Android so you know it's great to see some of the
9:55
offline software make a resurgence there even if it's from Australia so um yep that that is that all right now I guess
10:02
we can talk about uh our investigation into the Tik Tok thing here um just a slide um short tangent um this isn't Tik
10:13
Tok but it is Instagram and you know if they do get banned this is where they will be going but this is an a a
10:20
screenshot of an Instagram comment section that I've uncovered as you guys may remember last year um the Tech Boy
10:26
Media did investigation where we scanned through a 100 girls Instagram profiles and then um found out about 15.6% of
10:33
them get um questions about their appearance comments um complimenting them on their appearance well this is
10:38
one person that has uh about 1,000 or so followers here and this is a straight
10:44
screenshot just the names have been blurred out um and this is someone that someone I know knows right so this is
10:51
like a real person like not an influencer or whatever so um without further ado here we're going to pull it
10:56
up on the screen and um you are all going to see the beauty and majesty of this comment section and nope it's not
11:02
like the typical Instagram comment section filled with like racism or whatever this is u something worse all
11:07
right not whatever i'm just going to quote here quote "You are beautiful." What with four T's quote "Pretty girl."
11:14
Exclamation point beautiful girl exclamation point beautiful omg so stunning adorable literally gorgeous
11:20
you're adorable with three e stop you're adorable which you know if I had stocking the word adorable um I would be
11:26
very very happy at the time like this a cutie the cutest heart emoticon you look stunning adorable omg love this hi
11:33
beautiful and that's um just screenshot panel one i actually had to use Samsung's scrolling screenshot
11:39
functionality to get there so I'm scrolling on to screenshot panel number two so pretty i love you you're adorable
11:45
we are seniors eight if I looked up Jesus glow your pick would pop up how can someone be so pretty song why are
11:51
you so dead gorgeous tell me a secret a you're so pretty gorgeous as always you're so precious omg a I love you you
11:58
are beautiful yes that is a real comment section from a real person with only 1,000 or so
12:04
followers which just goes to show that um um yeah uh just go like fulltime i
12:11
look go full time this just goes to show how much how important April Harper is to um the tech media as a growth
12:17
strategy because if some random person of 10,000 followers can get about 30 comments um of that nature they're going
12:22
to be bringing in that money in about two years uh when they start getting brand deals or affiliate deals because
12:28
the engagement is up and it's at 99% positive um speaking of this I went back
12:34
into this account here's another quote uh I'm not going to show it on the screen but it's this quote here it's in
12:40
my photo pad from Instate Software so shout out to them quote "You are officially broken the record for the prettiest person to attend the Houston
12:47
rodeo let me know when I can get your autograph uh emoticon with uh heart eyes
12:52
and then I guess blessing and covering covering your mouth there." So um good things happening over on the Instagram
12:59
front for um 1.2,000 uh follower accounts over there um you know boost
13:04
your Instagram people and this is what you're going to be getting this is why Ava Harper is so important to the Tech War Media's growth um also you know is
13:12
you know again we haven't seen any of this actually happen in real life i only know one person that gets comments like
13:18
that but not to the extent of this uh scenario all right now talking about
13:24
social media teens teams
13:30
uh I I just I I work so hard to defend you
13:36
people i um you know I've been out here and the next topic is you're going to see I've been out here
13:45
um I've been out here defending you you're going to be um wondering why uh
13:50
why I'm saying I've been defending you because of these like stupid laws that are being passed and people are celebrating you know um let me see if I
13:58
can find the
14:09
article ah yes here we go from not to be great website great website you know uh
14:15
you know teens I do so much to defend you all you know even if I am roasting you in your Instagram comments but like
14:22
like uh let's just read this headline in all its beauty quote "The Tik Tok Shannon
14:28
says "Kids setting their schoolisssued laptops on fire." I I don't even know where to
14:35
begin with this we don't have to go into this article okay look I I shouldn't have to say this and to the three people
14:41
that are watching me and probably not teens don't set laptops on fire in
14:46
school okay now that that's um now that that's out
14:52
there how stupid are you people oh my gosh who who is setting their laptops on
15:01
fire in school and I thought you know I actually saw someone someone actually know actually posted a video of someone
15:06
else doing this so um yeah
15:11
uh you know um just just don't Okay
15:19
look do do we need a new reason to ban Tik Tok do do not set your laptops on on
15:25
on fire then of course there's also this trend where the teens are running
15:32
through the fence which I mean sure it gives property damage but it probably also gives them head damage which they
15:38
don't need anymore because I mean the two brain cells they
15:43
have left might have um fallen out when they hit the fence but I mean at least it doesn't cause fires and you know
15:50
poisoning you know have lithium fires an actual environmental disaster
15:56
i and now we're going to get farther to the anti- laptop people going to be like
16:01
"Oh you guys we don't want a onetoone classroom." No we can't have kids with electronics which um you know I'm I'm
16:07
all for it i'm for you know teens on social media and stuff like that y'all don't do this don't do this you're
16:14
making uh Glenn Yncan look uh you know he he is rolling he's rolling around laughing because uh he just signed a
16:20
bill governor of Virginia by the way he just signed a bill that would limit social media uh access for teens to one
16:26
hour per day under the age of 16 and then parents can control more now oh
16:32
also it's also limited to um chat applications so look I I have just criticized
16:38
teenagers for running through the fences and setting laptops on fire and I'm now going to criticize the governor of Virginia what an absolutely stupid
16:45
ridiculous bill i I I swear these people Okay first of all the bill is not worth
16:50
the paper that it is written on because how the heck are you going to enforce it how okay sure um magically every
16:58
13-year-old teen in Virginia is now about to be 16 also also it's according
17:04
to how I read it you know it's going to have to be like a per app basis so it's also like a completely waste of money why should Instagram have to enforce how
17:11
long people are are using their application like this is almost as dumb as Google like telling people how long
17:17
uh to use being advertising with their own money why isn't Instagram have to um um have to do this why why should they
17:24
waste their money on this because some team is schooling Instagram for this also limits chat applications which is great but you know what's about to
17:30
become who's actually finally about to make some money Snapchat cuz um some somehow you know Snapchat I don't know
17:35
how to make money they have AI they have chat they have video voice and they don't make money because um you know no one watches their ads of like the fat go
17:42
like the story running around you know running around whatever but like
17:47
this law is stupid first of all let's say you have Instagram Tik Tok okay no teen is on X instagram Tik Tok whatever
17:54
other uh and add some um actual social media application not Snapchat that's three applications one hour per each app
18:00
three apps boom you're great you're done okay the three three hours is fine you're just going to have a whole bunch
18:06
of influx of new 16-year-old accounts isn't what you're going to start face scanning them yeah i uh Yeah you you please try to face scan someone over
18:12
there because um trying to gauge someone's age as we saw last week was uh near impossible this is like this
18:17
20-year-old woman who was baking a pizza everyone thought she was 12 so um yeah uh good luck with um face gauging or
18:22
face scanning um someone's application second of all there no penalties for circumventing this application like most
18:28
teenagers are not going into influencing um career or or or a job even the ones
18:34
that get 30 million comments like um you're so pretty or I sm which is the whole reason uh the SSA um department of
18:42
teen change and translation was set up because I was scrolling through someone's comments you know trying to gather some intelligence i was like I cannot decode this we're going to send
18:48
this over to um Clara from um from SSA LTW um from NTV so if you're watching uh
18:54
Clara um nice to meet you uh hi um
19:01
anyway okay all they're going to do is and they've been doing this for years like for 10 years now everyone's been talking about fas and alts and things
19:07
like that they're just going to create alts and uh alt accounts there's no of course there's not there's no legal
19:13
reason for for this for this bill to exist just have the parents do it themselves there there should be no
19:18
reason it's a state law that's of course it cannot be applied to the students but you're going to start raating some 14-year-old for being on Instagram for
19:24
an hour and 50 minutes instead of his set hour yeah uh good luck with that Virginia good luck um that that's not
19:30
what they're going to be doing it's it's an absolutely abysmal law they they wasted taxpayer dollars to sit around there type up the law print it out and
19:37
give it to all the little Virginia representatives who have to read it they have to read go out there debate it and then Glenn Young has to um sign it while
19:44
you know I don't know Fox News and CNN were pointing the cameras at him and with all the teens and like the crunchy
19:49
mom sitting around behind them and they all clap their hands all like this for a fake law that's going to be circumvented by like a teen in two seconds wait you
19:56
think this is going to summit teens from um blowing up their laptops or blowing up their running through the fences no
20:02
cuz look in the 1980s the same teens that are blowing up their laptops and the same teens that are dumb enough to run to a fence were dumb enough to do
20:07
dumb things back then too you just wouldn't know about it because they weren't posting it on online in fact I I would wag you to say that there were
20:13
more dumb teens in the 1980s than there were in 2020 it's just that we see more dumb teams now because you can actually
20:18
see them right now because if I want to access some random team from Wisconsin right now I can access some random team from Wisconsin doing some dumb doing
20:25
some dumb thing okay this this law is not worth the paper it's printed on and it's ridiculous okay and look you know I
20:32
will not be for laws that would have limited and restricted limited and restricted but what what I did back uh
20:38
to start this company look I started this company when I was 13 years years old i'm not going to stand in the way of
20:43
any other smart teen who wants to stand there and create a tech media comedy because I'm a you know a dumb teen on
20:48
social media blew up their laptop or something like that no look all right first of all this law is not worth the prayers pointed on and even if Glenn
20:55
Yuncan can somehow figure out how to enforce this law I it's trash okay and
21:00
um Teen Pack uh I I will call them and they will get things um moving under way
21:06
you know you know who should be banned from social media and this is going to be very very very controversial um so
21:12
I'm just gonna keep uh uh yapping here but it's Let me see if I can find
21:22
I do know who who should be uh uh let me see if I can find it
21:33
ah yes the the Yeah here it is so it's always these like random and they always in like screenshots or whatever it's
21:39
always the apolitical black woman on like X or whatever okay those are the ones like look look at this post here
21:45
does this even make sense does it doesn't even make sense quote I told him he must have had the wrong number because what do you
21:51
mean uh I gave this guy my number at some event like two months ago and he called me today quest like 20 million
21:58
question marks i told him he must have the wrong number but what do you mean that's crazy it's always these like
22:04
random you know like vibe vibe posters who like "Ah I just got home from the
22:10
NLG Stadium." Imm no we don't want this no no one
22:16
cares about your stupid little thoughts okay no one cares you know Duncan you go sign a bando okay it's wasting money in
22:22
electricity you know by the way Virginia is the number one it has like the fastest internet because they have all like the spy agencies there as well so
22:29
uh yeah they're wasting valuable NSA and FBI resources so Yncan please go instruct the Department of Justice go
22:34
look into that speaking of the Department of Justice just total clown show over there again h going around and
22:40
targeting Google and Google's bringing in everyone from anthroponic to like all these other random Oh it's a Motorola um
22:46
saying how like oh I don't know having Google as the default search engine might actually kind of might be a good thing who
22:52
knows ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous yeah all right now we're still on the topic of um teen girls and social media
22:58
and things like that the 2005 teen girl trend and this is kind of shown in like media i think Haley did it uh Haley
23:06
Haley Morrison and uh Tamika Washington in like the 2006
23:11
episode like oh that's so weird or icky just it's it's so weird all right now speaking of Courtney for President
23:18
versus Shannon uh Courtney not Courtney Neil but Courtney Courtney whoever isn't what's
23:25
her last name vincent it's in this episode called The Election Deception which um I think I wrote a a
23:32
title to SSLW on that the election deception yes Courtney Vincent we got to talk about this episode because you know
23:38
I am such a huge fan of elections i'm such a huge fan of democracy you know
23:43
democracy most sacred value u has to be upheld um and you know democracy freedom
23:50
and yes I know we're constitutional public don't come at me people in my comment sections not Yeah yeah we're
23:56
constitutional public but yeah we love democracy look see the hat democracy great all right anyway um you know I
24:02
really like election episodes but um this one this one's pretty one of the best too and you know it kind of drove SSA foreign policy um when I was reading
24:09
about this on the AIO wiki back in 2019 because I didn't have a a club subscription yet until 2020 anyway here
24:15
we go the election deception which always um which always rhymes i always like it when people like talking about elections you know the um the aesthetics
24:22
of politics like the salutes and the hand waves and like the um like people going out there and doing press conferences and things like that so so
24:28
cool you know hey like stuff like that it's just so so so great so great all the pictures and like they they're
24:34
walking into a car or something like that just top tier top tier you know that's what we tried to emulate over in
24:40
SALTW for like the rallies and standing in front of a cyber truck with all people um with smoke coming up behind
24:45
the um smoke coming up behind the thing with drones flying overhead you know it's so
24:51
epic so epic you know I see why people run for president even they lose it's fun it's fun experience anyway here we go the election when Courtney Vincent's
24:57
diary disappears from the locker events conspire against him in the hopes of her becoming the newly elected president of the student council now you know there's
25:05
one small problem with this and you know let's let's talk about Shannon the other cannon that here she's running against
25:12
Shannon shannon oh she doesn't have a last name but Shannon is actually smart
25:18
she's conniving she's evil but she's actually smart cuz she is able to gain access to this locker here as well and
25:24
she's also able to somehow stay away from the Apple researchers and Lucy Cunningham salts because
25:30
uh the the Apple researchers um should have been able to bust it because the episode I heard right before this was
25:35
the episode where she has a house party and the police come by and they arrest her like college French or whatever her
25:40
her brother is college French and it's loud and she gets in a whole bunch of trouble and she's also like a head cheerleader so this this woman here
25:47
Shannon um was able to get all these people to come to a party because she
25:53
was the head cheerleader and she had the she had the power to decide i don't know why the head cheerleader gets to decide
25:58
who the new cheerleaders are and then the cheerleaders become popular so you know Shannon should have won this
26:04
election i mean she probably would have won this election if she didn't go unhanded and dirty and do dirty moves like this because she was able to
26:14
a come together and create an event which would make people popular and then
26:19
b she becomes popular and then she gets to decide who gets to be popular so essentially she gets to pick who her friends and enemies are and if she picks
26:26
Courtney or whatever she picks Erica or whatever and she becomes president she she she can either a influence her um
26:33
she can either influence someone who's in her true leading ring or she can run for president she's already popular so she wins easy and she's also able to use
26:40
her access um they explain how in the episode to gain access to her to her law group and use this information to uh
26:49
undermine Courtney because Courtney unfortunately even though she's smart she's out there running for president
26:54
and you know I I I don't condone what Shannon did here but she's smart she knew what she wanted and she did it i
27:00
said that about some other girl but I I forgot who it was and I couldn't search in the transcript so let's just get that uh let's get that um clip out there
27:08
she essentially blackmails Courtney without no anyone knowing and tricks her into showing up to um campaign rallies
27:14
and events she steals her speeches she um she she posts mean information uh
27:20
that she that Courtney has written about in all all around the school and even drives a wedge between Courtney and
27:25
Erica uh Erica's friendship now she only makes one mistake and that is um Eric
27:31
Erica no sorry Courtney um wrote a victory speech in her notebook and for
27:36
some reason Shannon used the same speech which doesn't even make sense like Shannon if you're just smart write your
27:42
own speeches like why why you have to steal her speech that doesn't even make sense if Shannon had never stolen her
27:48
speech the introduction speech and the um victory speech she would have never
27:53
gotten caught no one would have ever known that her journal was stolen and she would have won this election and Shannon even though she's
28:00
an evil conniving little girl probably deserve to win this election she is very very smart i mean heck she was able to
28:07
have the opera re researchers not know that oh the police were at her house at a party like how did that not how did
28:13
that not come into play in in the election now Courtney Cart here she's running up for president but the one
28:18
problem is why are you keeping your diary a journal of all your personal events not not your speeches but of all
28:24
the information that you have on people including including and of course it comes down to this that he had a crush on Rusty Gordon which it's always a
28:30
crush it's always that do not write that down don't have one but don't write it
28:36
down it's just why what who why would you write that down i I I don't get it
28:41
and then she also wrote down some mean stuff about Erica because he's like mean and and annoying and things like that and of course that breaks down the
28:47
friendship which I mean if you're going to write that stuff down don't do it but if you have to if you must write this
28:52
stuff down don't bring it to school of course in the middle of an election how is this
28:59
is this is politics 101 don't bring information that could be detrimental to
29:05
your campaign to campaign headquarters how How is this hard
29:10
Courtney how was this hard i I just the Okay the modern day version of
29:17
this would be essentially taking screenshots of all your snaps and then like posting them on Facebook why why
29:23
would you do that Courtney but of course she got caught because Shannon made up made two
29:29
mistakes and I'm alleged to believe that Courtney was to win the
29:35
presidency all right now there's also another election happening in Down Lane where
29:40
um well we're going to get to the down lane election later on in time let's
29:45
talk about the um uh kids corn election not the
29:50
catchorn election in which Liz wins three votes which is just how do you win three votes just
29:57
because you argued with someone i I I'm sorry uh this is the latest post on in fact
30:04
let's just let's just do the the most ridiculous Kitchcoin episode so I I rank the most ridiculous kidcoin episodes in every in in every season and um the
30:12
election episode was one of those things so that's going to really um kicking off the theme of our election episode themes
30:18
here so let's get through this the most ridiculous kids episodes one lost and round brought one of two this episode
30:24
should not exist okay look i get it's a parody of like the parable the the the a parody of the parable of the prodical
30:31
son wow that's a tongue twister but like the prodical son actually did something wrong in this episode liz the agreement
30:37
beforehand is that he can keep the cookies that he bakes and do whatever he wants with them so he invokes the
30:43
agreement and um what Linda gets mad at him because he did what he they said he
30:48
could be agreed to do this is this me getting getting mad like if um say Poland got invaded or something and then
30:54
they invoked Article 5 and everyone got mad because they invoked Article 5 like what that's what the NATO document is
31:00
for okay he invoked the agreement that he could do like he got tired of baking cookies he took his cookies and went
31:05
home now look did he have bad policy should he have given them out to some of the meanest people in in in town no no
31:11
he shouldn't but that's not a sin that's not a crime that's not wrong he didn't do anything wrong why is up there apologizing for um a doing what he
31:17
agreed to do and then following the rules of the agreement and then leaving that makes no
31:24
sense all right season two all right two of these episodes these these episodes
31:29
are ridiculous okay so this this article was supposed to be for the love about for the love of Liz but then like I
31:34
realized that it was only about two paragraphs long so let's talk about for the love of Liz so Liz says quote "OGG's
31:41
end quote." Uh and he takes God's name in vain and Grandpa Noli and Granny Gecko uh literally could uh take full
31:49
military tribunals after he says that i mean literally they spy on all of the kids in the town which is like 10 to
31:56
find out how they took God's name in vain and I kid you not now most of these kids are actually
32:01
send well I kid you not somehow the teachers were spying on the private
32:07
players of students and in the soccer games yes
32:12
according to Reframe Media praying that your team wins a soccer game is taking God's name in vain which is just the
32:19
worst theology ever i I'm sorry that it's ridiculous hey first of all the entire premise that you're going to um
32:26
somehow be able to get everyone including Skink the town bully to come to your form or what a freaking what
32:33
what are they going to do what kick you out of school they can't do that but anyway they all show up and they all
32:38
show how they're taking God's name in vain oh also I forgot to mention this in an article but everyone in the town for some reason is saying instead of saying
32:45
OG's or whatever they're saying "Oh Liz." And um apparently that somehow
32:50
supposed to teach Liz that um taking God's name is in vain is bad because um because because he got annoyed with
32:58
people saying oh Liz so just what what is the premise of this all right now for
33:03
the love list the election episode liz runs for student council president he has one argument with Lucille and he loses 70 to three how how how do you
33:12
lose 70 to three
33:18
i 17 to3 look Liz Liz is running up against one of those candidates who's
33:23
like I'm gonna do the right thing he's like a Lucille Cunningham sort of type of candidate right liz is Liz is the
33:28
coach of Kids Corner okay liz is the coach Stevens of Kids Corner h how how and this is making all
33:35
these like outlandish promises and things like that whatever but he has one argument with Lucille and the whole school's like "Yep we're going off the
33:41
node seven and three could you imagine if you know a United
33:47
States presidential candidate got up there and you know had an argument you know had an argument with someone and they lost 49 to1 okay last time that
33:55
happened was in 1984 and that's not uh why uh he lost all right
34:00
now how do you get three votes doesn't even make sense all right anyway uh season 3 uh student investigating godp
34:08
prince and what not to wear but you know as the modesty debater I'm going to pick what not to wear so this this this
34:14
episode makes absolutely no sense so Lucille wears something quoteunquote immodest they don't tell us what it is
34:20
but um as she puts on these clothes she gets invited to be join the iguanas the local
34:26
bully group of skink to join their club she stops scaring she stops caring about Bible study and she stops um and and and
34:34
then she's supposed to babysit someone so that she can you know make some money to buy a CD player but um the person sees her in this like I don't know maybe
34:41
the the the the skirt was like past too too too close up to it i don't know do
34:47
lizards have these anyway it was like a he lift above the knee or whatever i don't know let's just focus on the
34:53
family uh and um she she got fired what they're like "Oh how dare you how dare
35:00
you Lucille Monitor come up into this place wearing a mini skirt you're fired
35:06
never come in here again and then she um returns the clothes and feels bad because uh because yeah you know how how
35:14
dare she wear a skirt all right anyway loaves and fishes liz teaches This is actually one episode that I missed
35:20
before so it was really funny being able to hear it liz teaches the kids to repent from the monkey bars he literally gets on the monkey bars and says "Repent
35:26
repent therefore." Tries to write a book accidentally breaks a house and teaches a Bible lesson whole thing and goes over
35:32
the Greek word for the in Genesis 1:1 which as if you guys don't know Genesis 1:1 says in the beginning God create the
35:37
heavens and earth he goes over an entire lesson over the words in the uh hourong lesson meanwhile still wants to be a
35:44
missionary infest but a mean lying conniving neighbor hate after she asked for some money so see so uh Miss Tolsko
35:53
writes a mean letter to the church and the church is like well you know this
35:58
random lady we've never heard of wrote a mean letter so um and Luc is like rightly point out hey she's mean she's
36:04
conniving she's evil and they point out she's like well you got hate in your heart you can't go to Finn then sorry
36:10
all right season five what time is it lucille I've talked about this before lucille gets distracted by highspeed
36:15
email and then the next episode the next season is about you know internet shopping so it is obvious that VF Media
36:22
and Kona were going for a whole kind of internet safety um type of thing here but like who was she emailing who and
36:30
also this takes you out of character because she has not done a single wrong thing yet i mean other than I
36:35
guess wear leggings I don't know all right season six i almost picked the internet in the shopping episode racing
36:41
to win which is just lying to kids is okay if you tell them that cutting a field is actually racrack driving
36:47
practice and oh yeah we'll pretend to like faint in the back of a car to get the kid to drive you home to to the
36:53
hospital because they think they're about to die and um committing felonies is fun that's uh that's what racing to
36:58
win is yeah lying this is torch out and getting to commit felonies and driving and stuff like that i I'm not in favor
37:04
of that you know I'm not in favor of lying and felonies uh but you know if you are that that's fine with me all
37:09
right uh season 7 six o'clock so apparently these 10-year-old lizards have been upgraded from solving why God is good sometimes in their life to
37:16
investigating a stolen diamond mystery which really skewed how I viewed the world because I thought hey maybe I get to solve a stolen diamond mystery and um
37:23
I've solved nothing of that nature yet perin pie season 8 this doesn't even make sense maybe you're supposed to believe that after seven seasons of
37:29
Lucille being the goody two su carcus she's just like randomly running around the town stealing prize off of windows
37:34
no all right season nine a fair shake it's really a frustrating Korn episode lucil reports that she gets a test
37:40
answer wrong and then she gets mad that the teacher graded it wrong but you know
37:45
Miss Wadd is one of the most annoying characters so I understand that why and then Skink manipulates Liz into thinking
37:52
that Big Daddy his boss is ripping him off with his wages so then no Skink does
37:59
not get the job this kid called Scooter gets the job which makes no sense what
38:04
what goal does Skink have to trick Liz out of getting a job and replacing with Scooter in fact Scooter um in what's in
38:12
the name was beating Skink in an election and then for some reason they had another election after that so I don't know why
38:18
but Scooter was beating Liz in was beating Skink in election so it's not like Skink likes Scooter at all skink is
38:24
just a bully a halfway point yes so to teach kids that bad music is bad they
38:29
have this bad music star come in and Spike League likes him and then um the bad music star kidnaps him and um
38:38
steals a car and drives off with them because apparently Ubu doesn't exist in season 10 all right season 11 it's a two
38:45
point it's basically a two-part episode a one-off in a giant seven point series so it changed kids into the modern show
38:50
it is now by introducing some new characters and wiz radio station which actually is a key point here because
38:56
like Liz starts a Christian radio station and then in a few more episodes he's like robbing banks well not banks
39:03
but like essentially doing the equivalent of robbing a bank for a sixth grader all right so uh this episode
39:10
creates one of the best songs of all time God is in control but we have to hear some stank absolute absolute
39:15
garbage music quote unquote to get through it it is rough okay so they're trying to write a song and it is rough i
39:22
mean apparently these people couldn't create a song until atheist new character Johnny and only tells them
39:28
that hey maybe the instrument playing is not the most important cuz you know all right season 12 it is
39:36
something season 12 is something okay so um the finding a middle school which if
39:42
you've been keeping track Liz started the band got kidnapped hosted a radio station investigated a jewel high heist all before turning 11 and um vandalizes
39:49
a rival school so Liz in season 12 investigates a jewel
39:55
thief again solves a jewel thief again and in a few episodes later they steal
40:00
someone else's statue so um our moral superior Lizard
40:05
Acquaintus Loda has apparently forgotten that theft is wrong
40:12
three episodes after he ended up in the newspaper for solving
40:17
theft yes you're a great Christian radio host there uh guys all right now season
40:22
uh 13 yeah season 13 has demonic lizards faking their faith and I'm still going to pick hold the phone which is of a
40:28
ridiculous episode because tech has progressed so far back in uh in 2013 and
40:33
the top of the line phone is literally the Noki N95 which is I mean heck it's better than the light phone i I it's
40:39
better than the light phone and Liz has something worse than that he lost his phone and mean text appear on his friends phones and um unfortunately for
40:46
him his friends are not sane and so he texts the the person who stole the phone
40:52
text the cheerleaders and the football people and some I don't know blocking him reporting him taking it up with
40:57
their parents no they decided to chase him throughout the town
41:03
square yeah um if I decided to chase people that said mean things about me online I I I would never ever stop
41:10
running uh they chase him through the town square for some reason why why why are you chasing them
41:18
to the town square like do you cheerleaders have nothing better to do and yes they are brain dead because um
41:24
Cindy says "He insulted my intelligence." And Spike George just nothing to insult which is one of the funniest lines there um also in editing
41:32
I'll put in the line here all right season 14 love season yeah um this episode Granny Gako just drops $500 at
41:39
the park for the spiking list to pick up and then just like gives them an experiment on what they're going to do with
41:44
$500 and then she calls the Lizard Detective Agency midway through and she's like "So have you guys seen $500?"
41:52
Like what how what kind of premise is this all right season 15 Sinful Saturday fame Christian radio host Lizard Quintes
41:59
is bored on a Saturday so what does he do apparently he can't be at the station no sir so he's um just ding-dong
42:04
ditching uh mistrol skills dropping water balloons on cars and rides in a stolen car you know typical stuff
42:10
typical stuff you know somehow in one episode Christian radio host has done more sins or more crimes actually than I
42:17
ever have in my entire life so um good job for him too all right season 16 lying is fun again down to the nurse
42:23
teaches kids that so Liz is scared of his dentist named Dr pain which Why are you named that okay that's kind of your
42:29
fault or your mom's fault because his name is Pain so then Scooter devises to
42:34
teach Liz a plan a lesson so he goes to Dr payne and tells him to lie essentially so Liz meets Dr payne
42:41
doesn't know who he is in the Big Daddy and um Dr payne talks to Liz and basically says Dr payne is crazy and
42:49
mean and ugly to his face to to Liz's face so what he's not supposed to believe what the uh an adult is
42:55
literally saying to him to his face right there he said "I heard this i heard this." Right and then when he goes
43:00
into Dr pain's office Dr pl is then dressed up mean ugly snaggedy truth scary and it's all this big reveal to
43:06
prove that oh actually you shouldn't judge people by their last names what people are saying about them i mean you
43:11
know if someone says that they're mean and their last name is mean and someone in the middle of the street just randomly says they're mean maybe you'll
43:19
believe that they're mean uh great morals there Reframe Media great morals there um season seven tall
43:25
liars oh tall liars tone oh yeah yeah so um somehow Liz what lies about rescuing
43:32
someone to become student of the week because apparently all of what Liz has done for the town has not been good
43:37
enough to become student of the week he's been kidnapped like at least twice uh at this point he runs a radio show uh
43:43
he's been in the paper he solved multiple crimes multiple mysteries that's not good enough to get into the news but Cole bungee jumping is but
43:49
anyway Liz lies his way to national TV and the hosts don't fact don't don't fact check him don't go back and see
43:56
that he actually swallowed a bug when drowning and his best friend Lucil was able to find this out yeah um I'm I'm going to go I'm I'm Yeah no that that's
44:01
not going to happen you think someone You think I could just like pretend and lie my way all the way up onto Fox News
44:06
the cable channel um and just make stuff up with with no one not one person on
44:12
the channel is going to be like "Hey wait maybe this guy's lying." Yeah no okay i'm side tangent here speaking of
44:18
Fox News uh Fox News weather in particular how is Fox News Weather in business i I'm serious how is that
44:25
channel in business it's free it's just the weather channel and you can see what's going on in Iowa right now like
44:31
who who's watching that channel and how are they making money and also how are
44:36
they doing how how are their graphics so good it's insane it's insane um let me
44:41
see if I can find the image of this this is from the cable channel
44:53
this is from the uh cable channel but it's still interesting for a technical
44:59
tech technological thing here i've always wanted to know how like these news editing people do it so I'm just going to switch back over here i don't
45:06
know who this woman is we're off well look at that look at these graphics right here and the camera it's so good and u all the graphics in the screens
45:13
like that i mean it's so cool how did they do that it's amazing all right slight tangent uh back to um back back
45:19
to regular SK program we have We have to find out how to do that um how how did you do that i mean it's it's amazing it's amazing and you couldn't even see
45:26
it so um these are the graphics I was talking about here i mean look at this look at this high-tech stuff right here and the blur the bouquet and the the
45:32
stuff they're doing um back there i mean it's it's so cool so cool all right anyway back back to our schedule program all right season 18 the new improved
45:39
Kayla teaches kids that being pop star is bad or something i don't know and um lights out Lucille lucio literally
45:46
throws Liz's phone into a ravine because he's on it during a nature walk and the power is out of is out in town cuz
45:54
apparently throwing people's phone ravines is just okay cuz you don't want them to play a game or something like that and um when it finally turns back
46:01
on Granny Gak's like electricity bad we don't need electricity we we like the dark we like the dark all right season
46:06
19 change of plans so Lucille gets sick so Liz fame Christian radio broadcaster
46:11
has to step in and lead Bible camp and um his version of Bible camp is you know Colossians Colossians has a colossal
46:18
amount of stuff about Jesus in there so yeah that that's basically Liz's
46:24
theology right there which um is a far cry back from Liz's original theology of Envy
46:30
taking an hour long and in season 20 is essentially a fourparter finale which is just this random woman tries to take
46:37
over in four episodes and gets foiled by the all powerful almighty this detective
46:42
agency all right speaking of detective agencies auto decrypt cipher on Android
46:50
so if you have this application the Caesar cipher application this will actually decrypt Caesar ciphers that you
46:55
have automatically on Android phones really really great maybe we should add this to our spy series so make this out
47:00
i'm going to make a short about this and again how to make a 3D spinning o background RJS O this links back to our
47:05
spy series as well uh I'm going to see if I can play the video for you guys so yeah that's great video here it
47:14
actually kind of looks better quality than Google Earth sometimes as well just make sure you trim off a few seconds
47:20
from the back so that you're able to um see
47:28
it all right we have so much to get through today and I actually have a Bible study I have to do so I'm actually
47:34
going to go and cut this and go to a YouTube video reaction here because this guy he kind of made me mad he gonna make
47:41
me mad in this YouTube video reaction so let me me pull up my um YouTube history
47:49
this is the top 25 ugliest smartphones ever and um I I
47:55
think this guy needs a new what uh ugly means uh here all right here we
48:01
go i'm gonna actually mute that until we get to the ad hope you can see this buy
48:06
a pair of headphones getting their first phones
48:15
like that you know I actually like this channel here so um boom infinity Wi-Fi
48:23
is boom i love you get really fast internet and unlimited mobile for $40 a month for
48:29
a year [Applause] the hardware keys on the back all right
48:37
odin Valhalla Rising now available on mobile and PC so these are the top 25
48:42
ugliest smartphones ever made all right so one would be the worst 25 would be the least ugly here as well so we're
48:49
gonna be reviewing what the ugliest smartphones of all time uh would be considered to be all right ready so this
48:55
Let's hear them out let's hear actually we don't need to hear the intro here we go the first phone ready
49:01
25 kicking things off at number 25 from 2008 we have the HTC Dream also no no
49:07
look in this house in this house we uh kneel for the cross and we stand for the
49:13
HTC 2008 Dream look this is the first ever Android phone and you want to call this one of the ugliest phones of all
49:19
time absolutely ridiculous absolutely ridiculous this is not one of the ugliest phones of all time in fact this phone is one of the most beautiful
49:25
phones of all time let's hear what this guy's explanation about one of the ugliest phones of all time is he will
49:30
show some respect to the ACC Dream 2008 which is better it is better than any iPhone that ever has and ever will come
49:36
out today just this phone is amazing uh known as the T-Mobile G1
49:45
nothing like starting off with a fun but no doubt controversial pick it's controversial cuz it's wrong it's
49:51
totally wrong all right I'm going to um I'm going to Dang VP can't even run what
49:58
kind of computer is this and I really can't tell if this design
50:03
is ugly or cool maybe it's cool it's cool both i do have a soft spot for these slider phones but in any case if
50:10
you don't recognize this phone it is effective look look at this design here we got a touch screen we got all the buttons we can barely see the buttons so
50:16
I'm going to have to put this in at least 244p and we even have a smooth camera but I mean what more could you
50:22
want the first Android smartphone ever yes this is what the first Android ever
50:28
looks like in my opinion modern Androids should clearly be taking notes okay but seriously there is a lot of reason to
50:35
dislike this design with a thick bottom bezel that has the 3.2 in screen slide up on the left side to reveal the
50:41
landscape keyboard that bezel also kind of sticks out with this phone have having a more classic phone banana sort
50:47
of shape which is a bit odd but not uncommon that's fine okay look it's going to cove into your hand what you
50:52
don't like You don't like uh curved phones like that and he also goes on in this thing we we cannot go uh we can't
50:58
go through all of this i have like 20 minutes left um he he goes on to say that he didn't like the track ball and
51:04
the input options look we need more input options here um so yes in this house we we are going to support and
51:09
we're going to show some respect to this phone but let's go to phone number uh 24 oh here we
51:17
go uh so this is the the confusion does
51:22
quickly set in really hate it overly convoluted name for a clearly
51:28
overly convoluted design at first glance I don't really hate it but when you start to look at what is actually going
51:34
on the confusion does quickly set in if you enjoy having as many input options as possible we should we should have
51:40
more input options than than more buttons we want more buttons on our phones that's one thing that Apple's
51:46
getting right we want more buttons on our phones oh boy was this ever the phone for you not only do we have a
51:51
sliding quarty keyboard separate dial pad this whole navigation button setup but you also have the 2.8 inch 240 yes
51:58
sir look we want our styluses we want our buttons we want our keyboard keyboards we want our
52:03
trackpads touch screen and a stylus plus a whole bunch more buttons around the device powered by Windows Mobile 6 this
52:10
was a heavy hitter for smartphones of the time it just so happened to have the unfortunate situation of being released
52:16
the same year as as the iPhone which that's sad but okay of course you know
52:21
had like one button on yeah that's sad you know look I I never knew how to um do those things front the back of this
52:27
phone isn't too bad if a bit boring featuring a 1.3 megapixel camera and the device as a whole is very bulky also
52:33
what's with the font for this dial pad why are all the characters skewed like this and I understand why you have the
52:39
letters on the keys as well so you can type the oldfashioned way by hitting the numbers multiple times but why would you
52:44
ever do that when you have a sliding keyboard cuz it's fun okay you want to touch the buttons uh more times like
52:50
that what if the keyboard hinge uh right there you ever think about that huh huh huh this is an interesting phone and
52:56
kind of cool looking in a weird way but the design is a mess well um you you will show some respect to that phone but
53:02
yeah it is kind of ugly uh in all seriousness all right now let's go uh it's the Lamborghini
53:09
phone uh you know if it ever shows today there we go so they compromised
53:17
and did both and it's just not right man the 3.5 in 480p i mean how is he calling
53:22
this ugly this is He's saying this the 23rd most ugly phone not the most uh not
53:27
not the most useful no no 23rd most ugly phone it has a nice curved body and a nice bottom bezel and it's red 23rd most
53:36
ugly screen is surrounded by those huge black bezels and that's how phones looked back then plastic frame and
53:42
you've got this very rounded top and bottom but still it's weird looking kind of reminds me of a TV remote but I say
53:47
it's 25th 202 most ugly phone I know some ugly phones okay kind of sharp
53:53
corners which gives the phone a distinctive shape shipping with Android 2.1 of the uh uh uh Windows mobile phone
54:01
all right this one this this is just hesy right here this is just wrong okay people people used to be uh punished for
54:09
stuff like this at number 22 from 2012 we have the Samsung Galaxy S3
54:15
how can you call this the 20 second most ugly phone on planet Earth this is what
54:21
a phone looks like nowadays i mean sure there's like a few less bezels and a few more cameras but this is this is the
54:26
this is if someone asked you to draw a phone this is what they would draw at least five years ago you can say this is
54:32
the 22nd most ugly phone on the planet look and it's just a a a a slab Samsung
54:38
phone now look yes the bezels are a bit bit thick i don't know why they added this thing here they did take that away from the S4 but like get a grip 202 most
54:51
ugly come on the phone most definitely designed for humans as Samsung slogan prominently lets you know samsung Galaxy
54:59
S3 designed for humans okay so I heavily debated including this
55:05
phone and I already know there's going to be anger in the comments because you know a lot of people actually owned this
55:10
phone yeah there's a reason for that one right there um it is not ugly it is not
55:15
ugly okay we we we will we will not stand for this heresy we're not going to stand for this blasphemy against the
55:21
Samsung Galaxy S3 but the reality is the sentiment towards
55:26
this devices's design has historically been very negative on the internet sentiment towards lots of things that
55:31
have been negative on the internet doesn't mean it's it's it's right but the internet the internet is is probably
55:36
almost never right okay all right now here we have um this phone here all right what's the next phone at number 21
55:43
from 2003 we have the Palm Trio 600 and Trio 600 all right and yet again I can
55:49
feel the anger emanating from the comment section wait I'd be angry too i mean does this guy does this guy have a set of eyes look at it this is this this
55:55
posting would be like um would be like as you guys know Ava is statistically scientifically coded to be pretty right
56:02
and we you know we scan through like all the Instagram people scan the faces and um you know highlight the best features go to AI find out what the best um
56:09
person would look like and things like that okay so this person is a essent to be long hair hourglass figure
56:17
what we code it to be even Oh yep that's ugly yeah 99% of people would would
56:22
agree with me um this phone is not
56:28
ugly i mean this still looks good already look there's no question this is
56:33
a legendary phone and it comes from a different era one long before iPhones
56:38
well you know four years before iPhones really interesting like you could probably do all the same stuff you do except for social media on this phone
56:43
today than you can on this one in fact I was seeing these videos of people um using some old budget phones like $40
56:49
phone and also Linus Tech Tips was using some Samsung budget phone A36 I believe and it's like just as good as his phone
56:57
which is like we need to start innovating or people just going to start buying A21s and be like we're good
57:04
it's pretty sad how all these budget phones are competing on features and competing on price and competing on
57:09
cameras and they're all coming up to like even flagships from two or three years ago and people still holding on to those flagships from two or three years
57:14
ago s22 Plus I had that phone crack s22 Ultra you know if those are being
57:20
competed with you know a phones of of today you can't really feel it unless you're gaming i mean the phone industry
57:25
is dead and that's not good is this an ugly smartphone by modern
57:31
standards sure but for the time it was sort of slick it's not an ugly smartphone it's a nice looking
57:37
smartphone let's remember that this phone is closer to the Gulf War this phone is closer to the Cold War than it
57:43
was close than than now okay let us show some respect to our elders here okay this phone is literally older
57:51
than me all right here we go lg Optimus V at number 20 from 2012
57:57
we have the LG Optimus V i too much to hear his explanation for why it's ugly cuz um I I of all the phones here I
58:04
might actually disagree with them this the second most duck with this 5 in display at a 4x3 aspect ratio I I hope
58:11
we see more of sometimes nice wide screen along with this stylus that had
58:16
to be carried separately apparently there was no slot for it in the phone itself and I mean it's pretty big so
58:22
that makes sense but like yeah who's going to bring this around with them anyway by 2012 tablets were already
58:27
getting pretty well big and perhaps LG thought they could get ahead of the pack by making their phone wider rather than
58:33
taller you know the exact opposite direction smartphone design would ultimately head in because it's uncomfortable to hold nah nah nah we we
58:40
we we want wide phones sure the phone was slim and the 5- in display wasn't bad also looks very uh high-tech like
58:46
what you'd see in a book like "Oh yeah guys you can FaceTime or video call with someone." Maybe this would be like the access in uh access point to a door just
58:54
very very hightech looking and per se nice UI nice design but it was still uncomfortable to hold this phone is just
59:00
so boring looking even if you can forgive No it's not boring looking that that that is a respectable phone right
59:05
there the weird form factor which I can't by the way from the front it's pretty basic capacitive navigation
59:11
buttons thick black bezels standard enough the back features this textured plastic that sort of resembles leather
59:16
but most definitely wasn't leather and apparently felt quite cheap in the hand and you've got this weird logo by the 4G
59:22
LTE word mark that might have you actually think it doesn't think this is a Windows phone but nope it ran Android
59:28
2.3 gingerbread don't forget the Windows logo when this phone came out looked a little bit different again there was no
59:34
slot for the stylus which was called the rubber DM pen is the word stylus trademarked am I saying that right it's
59:40
a dumb name anyways but yes no slot for the stylus which is somehow even dumber than the name itself but what we do have
59:46
is an included TV antenna that's what I want to say you we need more TV antennas on our phones in fact this guy was
59:53
reviewing the Samsung Galaxy uh Note 4 and it had a uh ultraviolet sensor here
59:58
and that's what I want to see more centers on our phones yes sir we need to have more centers more antennas more
1:00:03
connectivity um uh on our phones we need to build that onto our phones
1:00:13
today it it should be it should be yes sir and um we're going to go through
1:00:18
more of these videos uh next week because more of the video next week because we're not going to be able to get through it the entire thing in
1:00:24
today's podcast episode so let me just finish up
1:00:43
here all right now let me pull up what's the next thing
1:00:48
we had on the agenda before we went into this because look we I will not tolerate uh T-Mobile G1
1:00:56
disrespect oh we still have not talked about the election in Kids Corner all right so let's talk about the election
1:01:01
in Kids Corner i actually have a newspaper that I actually want to show you this and I have a um one more
1:01:08
thing there we go all right so the election in Kids Corn is actually pretty interesting so Valley Girl Cindy um
1:01:14
decides to go against um Lucil Monitor after she shreds her uh opponent Ryan
1:01:19
which I mean doesn't really make sense like okay Ryan was not going to win anyway his personality he with him who he wasn't big enough to compete with
1:01:25
Cindy but like if if your opponent is like uh you know being mean and spreading rumors and stuff like that
1:01:31
that's just why would you drop out of the race cuz because your opponent said some mean
1:01:38
things about you all right one of the things that he said about Lucille was loose will instead of calling him Lucille in in a campaign ad which is I
1:01:44
mean absolutely ridiculous i mean would you would you drop out if um this guy named Ryan which is really interesting
1:01:49
because Ryan was the mayor of uh mayor of Kidsboro if this if this guy named if
1:01:55
Ryan was called Lion Ryan I just came off that and people started calling that like "No I wouldn't drop out the race."
1:02:00
I be like "No I'm not a liar i come back in and and start fighting." But you know I guess that's just me
1:02:07
the election kids are going to it's just Lucille focusing on issues and for some reason the kids actually care about the
1:02:13
issues which is kind of weird uh and Cindy really really fighting she's using her valuable accents she's basically
1:02:19
saying "Hey we're not really going to have work lucille's going to force you to have a lot more work." And then Cindy
1:02:24
even though she's portrayed as really dumb and having no brain cells she actually plants evidence um so that
1:02:30
Spike picks it up and says "I've been cheating on my science tests i've been cheating on my science test about her."
1:02:36
And then she calls the teacher up there to testify and she's like "Lucille Monitor did not cheat." Uh
1:02:43
hello you anyway she's like "Lucil Monitor I mean Cindy Crawford did not cheat." And
1:02:50
it's really interesting like like it's just it just the episode makes no sense
1:02:58
okay it's uh Yeah all right all right now over to the Alvin
1:03:04
uh ad advertiser in the sun alvin.net this is an actually decent newspaper other than like me trying to search for
1:03:10
like crime statistics here cuz apparently the last crime that happened in Alvin Texas was uh in 2018 but like
1:03:17
look at this you have actual news that's actually in the community of actual like people that things actually people
1:03:22
actually care about like you have us your political news here but you actually have your
1:03:28
uh okay that's from 2022 but you have your actual interesting stories here that people might actually care about
1:03:33
and then you actually have advertising and classified sports and things like this so um shout out to the Alvin
1:03:39
newspaper uh right there so really yeah here it is um shout out to
1:03:45
the Alvin newspaper right there really really interesting um here now one thing that I do want to propose here and I'm
1:03:51
proposing this to all my fans you know after the Tik Tok investigation or whatever you know there's this application called Citizen which has an
1:03:58
API and you can see all the crimes that have been committed around uh you and around your city or whatever right now
1:04:03
so I'm just going to go into it and most of these crimes are not reported by the local news like I said local news has
1:04:09
huge problems uh with you know actually being local like you go into KPRC or uh Fox uh 26 or whatever it's trash all
1:04:15
right so here's some local news events that happened around here vehicle oh that was yesterday but anyway there was a vehicle collision there's some fights
1:04:21
um police person stealing uh click the map again police activity someone may
1:04:28
need assistance police have received a report
1:04:34
of a woman with a handgun in a purse making threats near a liquor store so so many interesting stories that happened
1:04:39
close to you but like no one really reports on no one really cares on but Citizen has an API so if someone were to
1:04:45
take the citizen API look at all these events that you have around you make sure I'm like on
1:04:54
a All right yeah there we go so this is the citizen app you can see all of
1:04:59
[Music]
1:05:06
these you can see all of these threats that have been around the city of Houston um and and all these events and
1:05:12
all these alerts and all these things of nature and they think things think two men's fighting at a shell uh shell gas
1:05:18
station hazmat situation at the office building and you try to search any things up on the local news you're not going to see it it's not going to pop up
1:05:24
but if you want to search but since has an API you can get all this data if
1:05:29
someone were to create an API really to take this summarize it put it onto a news website maybe draw some ads on it
1:05:34
you have AI summarize the news website in six months the news websites uh gets gets money because it's really super hyper localal you set this up for
1:05:41
multiple cities so you have your Houston API you have your say uh what's New York
1:05:46
API you have your Denver API etc you have your API here you aggregate this you have super hyper local news and then
1:05:53
after then you can pay for reporters/investigators who can then go to those places investigate what's going on go get exposure to that go make
1:06:00
videos go get some uh YouTube news uh thing here because you know I really find the local news to be really uh
1:06:07
boring but I really find the technology behind it to be really interesting like I said for the Fox Studio like how do they do this um and so here is a post I
1:06:17
made on Reddit because it was actually interesting what
1:06:22
editors do the people on TV News actually use cuz like TV News video editors they they actually look a lot
1:06:28
better than the video editing that I personally can't do no matter what software I use and I heard it's always Avid or Premier Avid or Premier and I'm
1:06:34
like I've used Premier before i I really don't know how how you get that to work in Premier
1:06:40
um I used to have like a school license okay I'm not a criminal i'm not out here pirating software people i don't condone
1:06:46
that kind of stuff um anyway but you know how they have like the nice blue backgrounds or red backgrounds or what
1:06:53
color is MSNBC i don't know blue red and white i don't know anyway whatever backgrounds
1:06:59
they are on they have the quotes and they have the nice little voiceovers and they have the uh uh the graphics always
1:07:05
look better of course they have the news tickers they have the G live guests um reporting live from the the scene um
1:07:10
which always they look a whole lot better than like someone getting recorded on a Zoom call or something like that they always have their virtual
1:07:16
studios um and then of course when they're showing social media uh screenshots like I sometimes integrate
1:07:21
into my videos social media screenshots they are a lot better looking uh than what mine look like um of course they
1:07:28
apply gradients to images like all so cool they have like the type out of transcripts of phone calls and the
1:07:34
waveforms and everything like that you know what uh local local news TV news looks like i mean the editing is really really good it's topnotch so I'm
1:07:40
wondering if it's like just better like if they just have like more experienced editors if they have uh specific uh
1:07:45
software that's used by the news agencies all right so what they say is that most graphics are created in after effects and live broadcast they use a
1:07:53
eye news or media central i'm actually going to check in check out try there you go and premier pro um grass grass
1:08:02
valleys edias see this was actually useful this is actually the most useful response that I received here because
1:08:10
uh no one um because everyone's like add a premium pro a premium pro that's the
1:08:16
response that you're going to get if you look it up let's look up what uh this is the Grass Valley Edius let's see what they can do let's see what they can do
1:08:22
so this is this software eds 11 edit anything fast media at
1:08:27
hand connect anything okay it's a cloud unfortunately that's sad no
1:08:37
let's see let's see if anyone see oh here we go news productions right here this is great wait look at this don't
1:08:42
these graphics look
1:08:49
great can I see a screen yeah there we go let's Let's see a screenshot of this software let's see what it can do all
1:08:55
right so we got a nice layout here look at that nice little fake virtual background there we have our scenes we
1:09:00
got our shots we got our live key frames oh nice with live key frames will show appear on air with keys and and effects
1:09:07
i wonder if this can go here transition controls let's go audio controls
1:09:15
um look at this look at this yeah no isn't that nice so high-tech so cool
1:09:21
except for that like this monitor looks like it's uh was fighting in the Cold War alongside Reagan
1:09:30
um live squ production too nice all right now let's see what um Chyin Chy
1:09:36
does chy this is the Chyin Corporation i'm going to show show this on the screen all right let's see what kind of
1:09:43
products they have all right all right this is what they use for
1:09:48
uh I don't know let's pick Prime all right here we go let's see what they do
1:09:54
here so they have uh computer graphics branding touchcreens video walls let's
1:10:00
go click effects virtual sets and switches all right let's let's see what the video has to say for themselves look at this local
1:10:08
[Music]
1:10:22
news oh dang it let's go back there you go all
1:10:29
right let's see what they have here so uh no all right here we go so look at this look at this they got this see
1:10:34
local news always looks so much better and this is the software that I guess that they are using um so we
1:10:40
got your nice little like how how do they do this i always do something like that and say video ninja motion motion
1:10:46
ninja or whatever you have your like you have a gradient going in and out you got your names here you got your little stock uh your ticker which I actually
1:10:52
have an article on how how you can do that you have your video wall and you also have a nice back uh I guess it's a
1:10:57
fake video background set i mean that that is some high-tech stuff right here just to make this thing here and it's always like how like those news programs
1:11:04
on even highly well produced news podcast on YouTube do not look as good as this um I mean look at this you got
1:11:11
your weather on here you got your live which I'm always interested like how they get the live cameras to beam back
1:11:16
of course before internet um your nice video wall here and look at this like if
1:11:22
you try to point a camera at a screen it's not going to go well for you because uh this either going to take in the
1:11:28
screen's brightness or your brightness so yeah I mean look at this so cool so cool so cool so um back back over to the
1:11:34
thread to see if we got any comments no comments okay and Avid graphics so let's go back
1:11:41
over to um Avid but I tried Avid i couldn't even get a video to play um but this is Avid Avid technology um let's
1:11:49
see when we can get the graphics avid Maestro all right from
1:11:57
2022 let me try to put on my news Royce avid Maestro new ways to design your
1:12:04

1:12:10
touch screen here all your comments and your your your screens here they never tell you what kind of software you're using they never tell you what kind of
1:12:15
teleprompter software it is i mean there's all these interesting things that you can do that's hidden behind like some sort of payw wall like the
1:12:22
internet is being actively ruined not by artificial intelligence but by these pay walls and companies that you know if you
1:12:28
try to search up things of this nature um let me let me see if I can give you an
1:12:34
example oh yeah PBX system so I'm trying to research the history of a PBX system so watch live with me as I
1:12:42
uh So I'm just going to see i just typed in the history of the PBX system here i want to know how PBX systems work how
1:12:49
did they get that old music right this is the history of the PBX system hopefully you guys can see this on the
1:12:54
screen this is just me using Google all right look this is my one Google criticism for today so here we go here's the PBX system and the first article is
1:13:01
from a blog from some random company that makes PBX systems so it says the first PBX system was installed in 1979
1:13:08
and let me guess I will give I I I will bet $100 not actually that they're going to try to advertise their cloud PBX
1:13:14
system at the bottom of this article ready 2024 and beyond quote from 1876 to
1:13:21
2024 one thing is clear telephone communications is marked by brilliant minds unbridled innovation blah blah
1:13:27
blah blah blah blah the BCOM systems team is constantly researching and developing this on our 20 years um if
1:13:33
you're ready to continue your journey to the future PBX communications contact us today now this article is not that many
1:13:39
words because it doesn't have to be it's just an article that's sent to advertise the PPX system which is which is is VIP
1:13:45
and making calls via the internet which is really really sad and let me guess PBX boom cloud computing it's always the
1:13:53
cloud it's always these people who have these articles that always somehow links back to the cloud well you think the people in 1879 using the PBX were like
1:14:00
"Yeah guys we want this to go to the cloud." Here they go business again back from their history and now back doing
1:14:09
