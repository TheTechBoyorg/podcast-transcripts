<h1>This Week In TheTechBoy Podcast 21724</h1>
<pre>and we are live hello and welcome to the
this week in the tech uh
[Music]
boy podcast hello and welcome to the
tech boy This Week in Tech
[Music]
podcast hello everybody Welcome to the
weekend The Tech booy podcast and
today's topic of discour is there needs
to be a search engine for hackers um by
hackers on the clear net also we're
going to be talking about searches for
hackers by hackers but not the kind that
we're talking about in the first segment
of the show and then we also going to
talk about this uh actress from a
popular show I believe I've never seen
the show but apparently she's popular um
it's now on Great American family and um
which is a Christian streaming Network
might thinking yeah you're a Christian
but what does it have to do with the
tech boy well it's a streaming Network
Technology we were bored had no artical
ideas so there's that um and
also
uh what's it called oh yes I have become
Mo rale by inventing a fake case uh for
someone to solve unlike Mo by I didn't
think that they were going to disect do
have room and lock them in it so do that
also we need to talk about suzu Vel um
being able to open the door lock with
her phone removable battery this tells
us that suaro has an Android device and
uh it's probably Samsung Galaxy X cover
you know or maybe it's one of those
fancy J Japanese cell phones that still
has an i Blaster um and also there was a
pro not pro but a a a apple Vision Pro
article that was from one of those
websites that we talked about last week
that didn't talk about the how Apple V
and pro was going to talk about bring
about societal collapse in um in America
and uh cause all our children to starve
and die and become disconnected from
reality
and spiring everywhere that they go so
you know that's that's good
right wait
what
what oh my gosh I think we
um what is this
um yeah
ah you're getting resed oh my
gosh okay okay okay if if if this person
is uh listening we'll we'll get to back
to her
um uh CU cuz I I did a debate at this at
school and I tied okay I tied so I
didn't lose but I didn't win so it's
kind of sad and we we'll just wait we'll
see if she um comes into the stream but
uh if she does oh man it's gonna be a
she's gonna get run over it's gonna be
hilarious oh also Mr the boss um
switched to a smartwatch and I'll tell
you reason why I'm scared to have a
smartwatch not because I'm scared of
government track whatever it's because
I'm scared of um I am scared
that uh my text messages will be hacked
and if what's your name Nicole comes in
we will dissect that tweet so Nicole if
you are watching be sure to chat in so
that we know that you're here all right
um I guess we could talk about this so
tun and idea for hackers by hackers
[Music]
um yeah so when I am searching for hacks
and experts to do on my own computer
which for goodness sake a vast antivirus
is too good for its own good so uh not
sponsored right now but a asked
antivirus has blocked everything that I
have thrown my computer that I have
thrown at my computer I have encrypted
my mro um payload in msf console 87
times and it's still detected in a
matter of two seconds okay um I and
tried to inject a website with like a
link of beef framework injected I can't
even scan my own computer with inmap
it's blocking all the that so I mean if
V anybody is doing pretty doing pretty
well right um and I even tried a power
cell payload like who's scanning for
power cell payloads exploits and stuff
like that and it still detected that in
the matter of seconds I mean it
was it was
amazing
but like when you do search exploits
like how to do a man in the middle
attack or um how to hack someone's Wi-Fi
rou and post exploitation post exploit
it because this will bring us to our
next topic of zoomi which is the Chinese
version of Shan um oh I think we got to
reply
okay so Chinese ver showan
right um where will we yeah you'll get
all these search results from anus
companies like a asked an AVG telling
you that it is possible like yes I know
it's possible but they always say Hackus
can do this Hackus can do this but they
never tell you how hacks can do this
here's an example right let's say I'm
saying what is a man in the middle of
tech right a vast AVG or anybody's
company if be like a man in the middle
of attack is where uh hacker intercepts
the data in between the router and your
PC right and they can modify that data
and make you go to websites that you
don't want to go to and uh oh this pin
is broken and it's G to spill make you
go to websites you don't want to go to
and fish your credentials and uh and
just like control the entire network
right well that's all nice and all but
like how and it's not until you get to
like the second page of Google or you
know exactly what to search for that you
can find a tutorial for that um that
okay the next thing is let's say I say
how to hack a router because I found an
open router open accessible to the
internet on uh Zumi right and I typed
into IP did everything legally didn't
like hack into it already think right
but that's why I wanted to hack into it
which it was accessible over IP so just
use router exploit hack into it you know
right but then then what like you hack
into the router then what like let's say
I wanted to well I always say okay what
can you do the police exploitation on on
a router Router hacking right well
anybody with articles pop up again and
they're like oh well um you know you can
intercept someone's data from there or
you can start a do attack from the thing
from this it keeps giving you things
that you can do even in the hacking
tutorial articles it just tells you how
to hack it like okay great you hack too
much outed now well you could up wrot
firware or you could do this or you
could do that but it doesn't tell you
exactly what and how you can do this it
says an attacker which is just kind of
boring like you can tell me an attacker
can do something all day long but until
you give me a proof of concept
demonstration right no one's no one's
going to believe you right and then when
you give these proofs of Concepts and
demonstrations it's always are like
Defcon and they are on the news or like
say CNN or What's that show called 60
minutes right like that that's great but
not really because um they don't see CNN
in 60 minutes and what those the same
people no that's CPS right yeah CBS and
60 minutes and all the people who are
Defcon they don't really show you how to
do it they just show you that it's
possible that a hacker Advanced could
could potentially do this which is kind
of annoying which is why we need a
search in for hackers not on the dark
web on the clear
right of course and um you guys know
that I am a big Google fan and um I know
that kind of like causes problems with
my Bas you all duck. go and brave.com
users but
um like last week I left my base and
defending the Apple Vision Pro which is
kind of sad that I had to defend the
Apple Vision Pro because you know it's
an Apple product that's an overpriced
meta Quest that just looks aesthetically
pleasing
um and then has I message but not really
any app support anyway um so yeah I have
to leave my race and say hey look guys
Google is good sure it makes sense to
you but Google the search engine in of
itself is better than the alternative it
is better than [ __ ] right and if your
search engine is better than beinging
and it's better than all the other
search Eng because those other search
engs aren't made by multi-million dollar
corporations that can um you know
actually hello dream clay that can
actually fund a um
fund people fund a decent surgent right
the only other one would be Microsoft
and being is bad right we've already
established that right so we need a
search engine for hackers right because
Google just isn't cutting it right now
right and maybe Dr go being might be
better for but we need one spe specially
made for hackers right so here's what I
would say if it should have a mode to
filter um
out uh filter out
a a man have a mo mode to filter out um
what's it called um all antivirus post
so anything from anybody's companies or
like a.com maybe.com whatever
right so like you shouldn't be getting
seal J from like that or like
AVG or like
like what is it used to be getting such
results from companies that oh you can't
see
it let's let's look up uh router
hacking so I'm getting decent articles
here but let's say say say router
hacking take that away
right nordon AVG highspeed internet cor
F secure SSL 2i see all this stuff
here like in my version of this search
engine you wouldn't get these 10 results
from AA AVG keeper security all these
are antivirus or security company are
saying hey we can prevent this right or
hey this is what you should do or Ransom
real messages tus can see control but
they don't tell you how they can seize
control right they can steal data emails
and passws but they don't tell you how
they can do it right that's it's
annoying me I just turned on what am I
talking about oh okay so I'm talking
about um multiple things here I'm
talking about how there should be a
designated search engine for ethical
hackers right or cyber security people
because when you look up for these
tutorials right on Google all you get
are antivirus company is telling you
that this stuff is possible but not
telling you how to do it so the first
feature of this search engine would be
to block all antivirus and security
company uh blog posts right if if you
wanted to second of all okay it would
give uh search Resort Credence to a
major respirator like security news uh
uh not not respirator like stuff like
GitHub so you can find your exploits and
stuff and then someone would have to go
manually go through or created a program
that will go through and find the best
like I don't know top 100 uh free
websites that teach you hacking right
and make those just the top search
result so it would be a narrow search
engine so it's not going to tell you
like say I search up like who is the CEO
of when there be a security threat TT
people hack and do bad things no i' just
say not
because it's more of a security threat
right now if you think about it
right if I go online and say hey why do
a man in the middle attack and I'm not
taught how it's done and how to prevent
it right then it it's more of a security
threat right and you can you know go
back and do it yourself besides this can
be done against companies legally and
then you can they pay you to fix it
right if you have every all of this
somewhere where everyone can find it
then people would be more security
conscious because then they know that
it's more easily accessible I mean this
stuff is already out on the internet I'm
just saying there should be a search
engine program specifically designed
for this right I'd say it be kind of
like AI can be either used for good or
bad right i' use it for good right and
for fun
um yeah so we link to all the major
search engine not search engines
uh hacking websites that are already on
the cleet right this all on the cleet
not in the dark web right and then
second third of all you have major ENT
um websites and search tools so of
course you got epos on there you got
that other website search. that. rocks
on there that let you search for license
plate Lumber and stuff like that so not
like there's terrible scammy
um like intellus Mak you take like $19
or something for one people search or
something like that but actual people
search engines from ENT so it would cut
through all the spam and scam and scams
on there right and just um have the good
stuff from there okay and then R it I
guess uh Reddit security threads and I
guess the way this could be programmed
would be either using those Reddit
security threads because they would
potentially link to all the the
um to all those websites right they will
link to all o websites so let's say it
could combine the links from or oent or
security or uh met exploit right combine
them all there get all the websites on
there and then just search using those
websites using the search TOS there and
also search credit for the forums right
and then also search um oh YouTube
YouTube will be in there for the videos
and then I guess
Telegram and oh and then of course all
the websites that's it and then lastly I
guess you can pay money and is 2024 so
you have to have an AI component in here
an AI chatbot you pay like $4 a month I
don't know one mon free trial to get it
to
like teach you stuff from its own
database right so like most AI jet Bots
are super annoying they can't tell you
how to do something that is slightly
illegal and by slightly illegal I mean
like tracing my own walkie-talkies with
an SDR I mean it was so hard to get a
jgpt or being to give me to get it to
tell me how to do that like my own
walkie-talkies nothing illegal um so
this could like put together exploits
not not not not poly bad ones just like
you know teach you how to make them
yourself um it could tell you how to use
a specific tool which I have had some
success like using inmap and chat GBC to
create the commands right Etc because it
has been so hard and annoying especially
when people don't update they get
respirator and or their locks and I
can't use them while they have these
weird confusing klie commands it is so
hard to learn uh the skill that you need
to do because you're getting bombarded
with all these anti virus pages and all
these badly written articles so if you
took the top 100 security hacking
magazines right and take the top 10
Reddit threads the top just YouTube
search results um for something and then
filtered out all the virus all the
antiviruses all the spam all the scams
you have better oent search engine and
you would have a better hacking search
engine what do you guys think I think
this should be one and I would make one
if I had the Sero space and the time and
the money and the skills um so this idea
is free for anyone to replicate just
please let me have
the
uh okay and now I'm gonna talk to Nicole
if she's here see she hasn't told me if
she's here yet so I'm going to wait to
see if she's
here
Lex see these websites I don't know
if yeah it sounds
great like this website it's good right
but if we could just get all these
websites in here combine them together
into one big search engine that would be
amazing oh she says she's there okay um
hello Nicole um if you are watching in
response to
your um where is
it what did he say I'm G to read this
out
live okay it says you can't be you can't
say you're a Christian to be proon I
know it's trough one if you're American
because it's part of your culture it's
part of the Fifth Amendment the right to
be arms um okay that's the second
Amendment so uh there just that um uh
God said though thou sh not kill if you
save you go to Heavens to being unarm
should not be an
issue well
okay killing and Modo are two different
things right so it says th not m in the
Bible um that would be a
self-defense
and um what it be yeah self-defense
second of all um if if someone is
hooding your I don't know child or wife
or whatever it is your job to defend
them as the head of the household um so
you know you should
probably you you you should probably
like defend them with with the weapon
right and and second of all um it's it
would just be a safety you know choice
it be kind of like not wearing a seat
belt well you know if you die you go to
heaven yeah that's not really a good
argument for doing anything because you
might as well just like jump off of
building
and yeah so that's my explanation there
like besides there's also other things
that you can do with like you know
hunting
and traveling and Hunt hunting yeah so
yeah and AR used for protection which
wouldn't be uh moo just be killing
because it's in selfdefense so there's
that all right let's see let's see have
any nothing okay um all right
now um we'll read if she responds back
to us anymore we got to talk
to
um what's it called uh I talk about m is
the boss on
YouTube he he has a smartwatch and he
also uses a iPhone a Samsung phone so he
uses Apple watch but carries on a random
iPhone with him just to syn with it but
he uses a Samsung smartphone but he
recently switched the Apple watch after
being anti-apple watch and this is what
he has to say now I'm wondering how he
gets
his how he gets his
um how we get his notifications from
both phones like did they sync with each
other and we also need to check s23
Ultra prices because I don't know maybe
maybe I'll get one what's your opinion
on Rick Rolling in that whole culture oh
yesterday kid at school actually Rick
Rolled someone a teacher with a QR code
uh in his presentation that was pretty
interesting um I guess it's interesting
like you
know um
yeah rck rolling is I I guess it's fine
I guess it can be an easy way to teach
you Internet Security like uh with OMG
cables you could program them so that
when they're plugged into a phone and
then you execute your command um they
open the browser and start playing the
video so you could say okay look here's
a proof of concept that it wasn't a
malicious link if it was a malicious
link like say a beef link and then it
popped up and it started asking for your
your Google credentials and then I
offici your Google credentials and got
them that wouldn't be good not with
it right so I guess it's it could teach
you like be careful with the cables that
you uh plug into your
phone which which which the OMG cables
like we're using them for security
purposes right now I don't have one I
really want one but I guess be an
example of my surge engine right OMG
cables right used to be a $20,000 NSA uh
spy project which is just interesting
and cool um I know like half my B is
going to kill me for that but
uh just really in say spy project like
$220,000 and now it can only get for
$200 that's like 90% off right there
um yeah and still no big hacks have
happened because of an OMG cable right
that's probably the same thing that
would happen with this search engine
right the search engine wouldn't be like
super big right it's not like we'd be
overtaking Google and Yandex and Bing
and uh we just be like an N hacking uh
website kind of like that oent website
where you can search for images and get
their locations using AI what's it
called GEOS spy. AI oh man I have I have
I have longed I have longed for a tool
like that for so long and it's it's so
good um anyway what are we talking about
oh yes M the bosses
smartwatch
okay here we go I'm going to sh it on
screen hopefully you can see it it's F
in the mode
we're not going to watch the whole thing
it's like it's only 16 minutes last time
it was like 27 minutes 10 years I
persistently put off which is kind of
weird like 10 years 10 years ago long
time it was 2014 like the iPhone 6s was
coming up of using a smartwatch no
matter how many people have recommended
one I've always said I'm not a
smartwatch kind of guy I don't want to
be pinged 100 times I like smart just
and I actually installed a browser on
someone them but they took it off or
something because they switch phones or
something like that
um SmartWatches are interesting right
they you can use for communication and
stuff like that I only wish the camera
on them um because it' be really easy I
mean Samsung did it way back 10 years
ago in 2014 12 or something like that I
mean heck even my
uh VTEC watch had one so like if VTech
can do it Samsung can too but the
problem is I don't want someone being
able to hack into my text messages and
be able to send my afford six digit
password right I have a 18 to 22 digit
alpha numeric uh password so I wouldn't
want someone
to do that day with notifications I
don't want yet another thing that I have
to remember to charge I don't want to
reply to messages using a keyboard the
size of my thumb but late last year Dr
and I were trying to find the perfect
Christmas gift for our team and we kept
coming back to this idea of Smartwatch
getting each person the same watch and
then creating this fit kind of weird
though like every member under your team
uses an iPhone like it's kind of sad
like you have the like they you on a
tech YouTube channel right they can
probably use any phone that they want I
mean this guy has literally a cabinet
phones I'm pretty sure um he give them
or leaste them like as long as they're
working for him at least one phone right
they okay they could get an s24 ultra
they could get a uh assus uh LG phone
they could get a um L noo phone from
seven years ago
okay and yet they choose
they choose just a random basic iPhone I
mean that's that's kind of sad this
challenge between us that will help us
all out with our health
goals it's partly that now anytime
within a second talking about how uh the
the Rings and the apps and everything
they
control the um gamifies the workout
experience see exactly what you've been
lacking today it's partly that it
rewards each completed ring with a
really cool animation pretty equivalent
to the in-game thrill of beating a high
score or unlocking a new upgrade and
then partly also the ability to compete
with others so in the Apple fitness app
you can add in anyone who also has a
watch and when you do that you can see
their Rings they can see your rings Yeah
Boy most smart watches have a feature
like like that what is that name of that
software privacy eyes pure eyes
something like that where you can see
each other's browsing your if you look
up something bad or something like that
wait okay let see I understand you don't
like iPhones but they're not bad why do
you hate on it for no reason I mean I'm
just saying like every member on his
team that's like nine people all have
iPhones and he's in the
UK and they can choose literally any
phone that they want I'm pretty sure
well it's not like he uses those phones
every day maybe they go back to them
every six months but
like he has literally broken a Samsung
phone in half and smashed it with the
hammer it's not like he they they can't
get any phone that they want okay like
if you if you can if you can if you're
able to go out and smash a ham on a
Samsung phone
I'm I'm pretty sure he can also give one
to a teammate right
um also iPhones they just the software
is not that intuitive okay everyone says
they're intuitive like my grandma them
uh if if they weren't int if they were
intuitive then I'd be able to use them
but and also there's no
customization and let's say that your
favorite app gets pulled from the app
store or well unless you're in EU which
um thinks they can control how
smartphones on made for some reason like
who are you why do you think that you
get to choose how smartphones are made
butress unless you're in the EU you
cannot download it externally and you
should like root the file and get an IPA
and have a Mac or something like that
and second of all this not they're not
interoperable and there's no other
alternative let's say you want a micr SD
card slide I mean you're screwed I mean
you're kind of screwed if you have a
Samsung but you can always go over to
like Sony and get the same is experience
on on your phone right uh
let's say
um let's say you want to transfer files
over USB yeah that's also not happening
okay you gotta use iTunes or air drop or
iCloud right okay um let's say that you
want a really good zoom camera well okay
not anymore uh then you you can get last
juice Galaxy s23 Ultra you want a stylus
you also screwed go get an iPad
um let's see um appon Market cap that
worth of $ 2.82 trillion of February 16
23 market cap has increased I mean yeah
it's pretty good um C
uh from a standpoint like that but I
mean that's that's not only from iPhone
sales but it is number one product
that's from iPhone sales iMac sales as
Samsung has a market CRA at
367 well yes but but
Samsung uh
you know I'm G to come out here and say
this for the first time Samsung's car
that they already have right now would
destroy Apple in a in Apple's new car
because Samsung makes tanks Samsung
controls all the South Korea okay
Samsung is basically the defective
government of South Korea is kind of
right well yeah Samsung sells May way
more phone is they're kind of tied now
but um Samsung also does other stuff too
and remember apple is an American
company which means that they you know
they're bigger than Samsung even though
Samsung makes tanks Samsung is a South
Korean
conglomerate which has different you
know laws and stuff like that and they
also have part of the defense industry
the construction industry the printing
like printing industry like the only
thing they don't make anymore is desktop
PCS you can go to buy Samsung you can
get a Samsung watch Samsung security
camera Samsung phone Samsung tank
Samsung refrigerator Samsung washing
machine Apple all you can get is a phone
computer laptop
and
like yeah that's it and then of course
Samsung's coming out with a ring
so and if you ever do end up getting one
I would strongly recommend you find at
least one person to set this up with
because knowing that anyone can check
your stats at any time during the day it
just adds an extra see app say so Apple
doesn't have the right to be a choose
what phone has but Samsung has the right
to Be an Effective Government
what
huh no like in South Korea because it's
a smaller country and Samsung's like the
one of the biggest companies there
that's how they run the Govern but you
apple apple couldn't run United States
government all in California I would win
Washington DC right I mean I'm saying
I'm just saying that like yes you can
choose an iPhone it's in but I'm just
saying it's an interesting coincidence
that every person in the room all used
iPhones like if you take any nine people
in a room adults not children because
you took nine children in a room they
probably all have iPhones if you take
anyone over say the age of 25 right
who's working for the same company right
let's just say you go down to the local
I don't know T-Mobile right I don't know
how many people does T-Mobile hi let's
say four or five so you go around to two
of the local T-Mobile stores right uh
some of them some are right right next
so you go at the Boost Mobile and the
T-Mobile store right you go right down
to local boost and T-Mobile
stores all right maybe eight of them
will have apple and one of them or seven
or five and four or two and eight or
some kind of ratio but nine straight
everyone has let's see there's good
Synergy between they probably have it
for the advantages of the Apple
network but Mr the boss himself switch
to a Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra one month
ago he made it he had it in his video so
I don't think he's controlling how to
use different phones like I think
everyone uses the Mac for video editing
which makes sense um
but um just everyone using an iPhone
like even the new people that he hired
his uh wife well not wife yet person
he's engaged to
um like that
is that's just insane like I think MKBHD
he uses Android phone uh um I'm pretty
to someone else on his team use Android
phone and he's in America where iPhones
are like 50% of the of the country right
in the UK it's uh it's
lower let's see representers of Brit use
iPhones stupid Desmos why is you coming
up
here
okay according to this uh 50% market
share in the UK
and 60% in the US
right yeah he changes up his phone once
a month because he already has a phone
that test out but like his personal
phone that he's like switching to for
like the entire year is the s24 ultra so
like when you tested out the OnePlus 12
he just used it for a few um for for a
few weeks and then put it in his phone
closet but he kept the s24 ultra like
he's still using it I think he uses both
on at the same time because it wouldn't
be it wouldn't make be safe or secure if
he had all his accounts logged in on two
different phones always uh like just
lying around
somewhere yeah yeah it makes it
competitive and stuff like
that here we go watch
faces
customization new
bands
what is that that looks like a nice
application right
there let see Mr the boss phone said
iPhone wasal
Samsung ecosystem mix iPhone yeah that
was last year but this year the s24 like
stepped up we can switch to that video
if you want and and and uh react to it
because he said still the s24 stepped up
and he switched to
it
that's why I don't kind of want to
squish because then people think I have
an Apple Watch I mean I
don't I know one person that has an
Apple Watch Ultra and had a s pixel
pixel pixel 6A which um that means the
watch was two times more expensive than
the phone it's
interesting
oh I mean that makes sense I mean it's 4
One in
screen oh yeah I like to when my tablet
that cuz like the screen was black and
the everything El the bezels are black
so uh made me think that the screen was
bigger than it actually was then I saw
oh wait no the bezel is actually like
huge though it would be nice you know
like track your phone down have
aot activated voice record and Camera
shot stuff like that you know for
completely legal non espan reasons
which makes sense like if you have your
watch and you see your notifications on
day you're not gonna be able see Tik Tok
and Snapchat and stuff like that now if
you get some Watchers you know you might
be able to get full into OS on and which
is going to lead us now to our next
subject talking about Zoom ey that's
right Zoom ey it is knockoff Showdown
from China so uh yeah be probably be
careful with the uh stuff that you give
it all right so this allows you to
search for stuff online on the internet
computers connected to the internet
right so we had a tutorial about this on
the tech boy.org I'm GNA show you how to
do it so what you got to do is I'm gonna
say OS that stands for operating system
click there and let's see I'll let this
guy here pick a his favorite Windows
version we'll type it in so dream clay
tell us what your favorite Windows
version is and then we will type it in
we will find all those computers
connected to the
internet okay let's see
newest one I don't care okay uh that
would be Windows
11 all right so Windows 11 which do your
type Windows 11 I think you have to put
these uh things around
it and then you'll type in
Port like that 2 I don't know that's the
tail net port by the way but if you want
to find an actual computer maybe type
like Port 445 or you you can go look up
what puts connect to what things and
like the RP put and then
what is
the RP
P remote desktop protocol which be the
most vulnerable system if you think
about it then you can connect to it via
G right is 3389 right so then you can
search there so we're searching OS
Windows 11 computers that are connected
to tet and grab these banners here so if
I enable tet on my computer and then
typed tet that copy that IP and paste it
in this is what I get and then i' be
able to log into it then if you want to
collect connect your um pick your
country you can need to go to the map
here so as you can see if you got Brazil
us uh China Russia right the biggest
country would be China here um in terms
of the amount of computers connected if
I had tet over
there but but I'm going to pick country
so us and then I live in Houston
so
Houston it's going to find all the
computers connected to tet in
Houston um connected to Windows
11
Wait no that's Los Angeles CU we're
trying all ones in the United States
right now oh wait it put a space in
between us right there you go SE in a
space between Houston there you
go so right now the United States is
highlighted and it says we have 3,000
computers connected right
there so I found some like website
hosting here all on cloud right so there
not much right but let's say I wanted to
search for an RDP Port right so we have
still the OS Windows 11 port
389 right and then if you wanted to find
a web server you could find I search for
480 right so here we go we got uh RDP in
Vietnam Singapore Thailand right that's
I want to pick my country so that's
United States we got 17,000 computers
right there
right
and you can see the vulnerabilities
right here
so there's like a woodf vulnerability a
pachy
vulnerability right there now Windows 11
is you know all intent and purposes
pretty secure right so let's say Windows
98 and this is this is kind of shock you
guys the U actually
has wait there like imagine having your
computer system assass to the internet
like a
little
a uh no you probably shouldn't CU you
might lose it that uh you should
probably like keep your money in my
opinion
um uh what are we doing oh
yeah imagine this you have an operating
system that came out in
1998 right almost 10 years before I was
born right and a literal child on the
Internet is able to type in this a
little s cre this is completely legal by
the way right as long as they don't like
like use this and then go onto Hydra and
start Brute Force attacking the the bus
right or use any of these exploits
without
consent but like someone can let you
just go in here an attacker type in and
it'll see that your computer is
connected on Windows 98 to Port 300 389
so that means they could uh RDP into
this and to prove it I will prove that
you can RP into it so I'm not actually
going to like connect to uh not connect
to it or that one didn't work let's see
let me let me copy the IP again there we
go I'm actually gonna like type in a
password
but okay that I don't know what that
was okay so maybe that one just
filtering stuff but you can you can just
like keep testing it right there still
completely legal can connects to a
remote session and loading loading
loading but you can find all this
information on
here here we go remote desktop
connection you can even sewitch by
application that's connected to oh
congratulations all right anyway connect
to application right there copy your IP
right cancel this
connection
and it just asked me for my password to
connect to this IP like easy I if I knew
the correct password I could get in
right here we got Windows Server
2016 connecting via the remote desktop
protocol in United
States and this is Compu these are
computers that are open anywhere here we
go OS Windows
98 connected via for 445 the united
nation has a computer connected for Port
455 and if you look up what is port
445 it's the net BRS Port it says quote
this port shouldn't be open for external
networks well obviously it is because
this website was able to index it
right and if I left my computer open
accessible online on
tet
then I'd be able to connect to it let's
see
I wonder if like it wouldn't be illegal
M to if it didn't have a password right
because it's basically like like
visiting a website at this point it is
an IP on the internet
um that is accessible open VIP like a
website
link and it's on Windows 98 like every
exploit ever like let's go to exploit DB
right now
okay I don't even think they patch
Windows 98 anymore like at least we on
XP at least they patch that last like 10
years ago and an emergency R in 2017
because I want to cry what no what kind
of question was that okay of Windows 98
I mean they're gonna be laughing at
you like imagine having a financial
computer from the UN like the literal
World Government peacekeeping people
okay we go Windows
98 I'm G to
filter type whatever platform
Windows
445 here we got his remote vulnerability
from 2005 right let me thinking oh
whatever Spanish okay let's just pick
this one
here no let's read it
here Windows itself is just
vulnerable to this
exploit here are the things that are
systems affected Windows Server XP in
2000 so Windows 98 is too old for that
so let's just search
Windows
98.
445
what this is completely legal completely
on clear net completely um think here
you go Windows 98 XP in me notified
buffer blah blah blah
blah exper this is remember this is
completely
legal and if you inmap scam it which is
also legal still
um I think because it's not like you
uh doing anything so actually you can
scan this from a phone okay this is the
UN we're talking about right any
computer that's on the internet any
website that's on the internet can be
scanned and is scanned right I mean if
there index X by a search engine so like
it's not like
um it's not like it's not happening any
anyway so I can open the cyber security
folder on my phone here right and go to
Port Droid which is like inap Android
okay and I'm going to go and say um Port
click the port skin option and type in
that IP but because I am smart and have
a very advanced phone I will use the
extract text option on my phone and zoom
in there we
go and oh wait it doesn't detect the
text so I unplug
it no text found okay let's try this
again H okay I'm going to have to do
this old fashioned way so I'm going to
type this in it's a for
seven where's my
period
dot oops no no
no okay okay um got go back dot One
n nope not done
dot five
n this this is terrible do one and then
we know it's just 44 five okay
done scan and it's going to do a
reability check it's scanning right now
it says 1 14 is
closed so maybe the search engine was
wrong okay this to preset just a quick
scan add five scan so while it's
scanning right now I think it's done
it's scanned all the ports no it's not
done yet okay but there are exports that
you can run on the machine right and
then of course we're not going to
run heck we could ping it right so let's
say there you go open my
terminal this Windows terminal
ping
oh wait it Cy has an HTTP
think my arrow keys are
broken I I don't know why my AR keys are
broken but whatever so I'm going to go
back in there type pink
and I got to reply which means it's
actually
online okay and there's another one from
Saudi Arabia on P
135 collected Windows
98 oh it's say of
scene and you can either scan it for
vulnerability like a tunal blue or you
can
um log into it let's see I can search
you now here's where my search idea
would come
in L to
PC or you can force with might exploit
or go
or you could
delete oh here we go we got nice AI
here here you go colnect to your Mac or
PC via SNB right and someone could
let's
see oops okay I don't know what's wrong
with these arrow
keys
okay now there's other things that you
can find on here as well like say you
want to search for a web
server so let's say um
Port 80
service Apachi too oh my gosh the L
key it is time for me to get a new
laptop the a key I can't even see it the
S key you can barely see it the
backspace key is
broken and here are all these things
right here now you may be wondering like
what you can you do if tell or whatever
like you can find BBS servers on there
so that's that's
interesting and apparently if you want
to connect to an SMP sh you have to
enable it from um
features do have to turn it on as a
feature me
see all right let's see what should our
next topic
be oh we got to talk about the s22 ultra
and see right check the Press on eBay
maybe I'll get one let's see and I'll go
into Windows files and say
Network okay I'm going to tune off SMB
so if we don't get heck
cancel okay cut
okay don't
restart off
okay all right so here are our prices
on
eBay
Galaxy s23 Ultra let's see how much it
cost us okay so this is obviously fake I
mean look at this C screen fake
stylist
okay okay oh you can get s23 Plus for
650 decent I guess 604 okay these are
all brand new so that that do um I will
filter oh okay that's a that's a bid
that's a
bid 79 let's say under
570 let's see what we can get you can
get a 22 Ultra for like 370
now oh here we go here we go oh that's a
big that's a bid that's a bid okay we
want to buy it now we want to buy it
now okay let's see obviously this is
fake it says it's 7.3 inches Samsung has
micophone set of 7.3 inches okay that's
fake all right got you can get a regular
s23 for
389
okay you can get one for okay that's
fake that's fake oh it says it's four
point Parts crack screen it's not that
bad my screen's like cracked that
much I mean four parts are not working
this looks like it's in like seven out
of 10
condition that's not too bad I mean my
screen's crack like that okay yeah
that's nothing little screen protector
couldn't handle maybe screen replacement
scuffed up a little
bit I use that only three oh my goodness
that's perfectly
good oh the funny thing is about the
search engine um you can actually search
for Android phone too you say
OS
Android and you will find all these
Android phones connected to here
um oh you got to put these question
marks found it
okay so here here we are looking for
Android phones right I'm just going to
pick China all these phones are
connected to Android I think oh not
found
okay so I'm going to delete Trina
bye let connect ADP HTTP SSH ad hey
maybe it's a Samsung Samsung
Malaysia
avv I think all these phones are
connected to
AirDroid cuz cuz when I checked last
time it connected to Android which is
kind of
insane that you can connect that uh
detect
that
okay let's see oh we have three oh you
can't even see the screen today we have
three people right now so uh everyone
who's watching you can pick a topic that
we will talk about and um we will talk
about
it let's see oh let's see if spy AI got
any new
updates I have a Discord a pro and API
now all right let's see let's go to
street
view
see
Let's see we can take a screenshot just
something
random here's a park right
here I don't even know where this is
never been I don't
know okay and here's street
view and I'm clicking the street view
thing
there remember guys if you check out uh
our here we go it's just a fence in a
neighborhood right here and I'm just
going to take a screenshot it has some
trees in it so I should be able to
identify what city it's in at
least this images captured last year in
January okay remember guys you can
extract uh text from photos using your
OCR and Google uh not Google um in in
the snipper and you can also generate
images with AI in your uh Google
Microsoft Paint so AI tools to your
desktop right there right here we go so
just a random neighborhood in Houston I
think
um yeah Houston Texas um and it is
analyzing what do we have here it's in
Houston Texas it's a residential street
in Houston Texas it house in the back is
a typical houstonian house it's legation
is consistent with Houston estimated
quance and I think this is like Houston
city limits and there's a map right
there and it says these oh my gosh we
got some oh they added some photos here
that link to Google Maps all right let's
see the let's see what's our address
okay okay I'll just tell you if the
address was
correct no no no it didn't guess the
correct address but it did guess that it
was in Houston Texas so that was good
um I'm G to go back to my map go
big
um
okay there you go libery
Road I'm going to take another
screenshot
there and that wasn't even the front of
a house that was just like the back of
it if I took the full screenshot I might
have been able to identify
everything okay here we go we got some
vegetation on the road
here and there's a truck in the
background going bring this
down
we're just looking at the ceiling ski
shifts I'm going to get the truck but I
don't want to get the road name because
I get the road name it will read the
road name and tell me exactly where it
is okay we got the
fixture and I will save it to my hard
drive it kind of looks like a
panorama and this is one of the most
interesting tools on the face of the
planet I'm going to upload it you can
even take your own pictures at least in
the mobile version of it like if you're
on a phone here you go that is the
picture that we have here let's see it
is generating let's see what it
says
Romania there are trees so it's in
Romania okay so this tool is um it's
kind of bad uh I guess if if you're just
in the middle of the Woods and it has me
it looks like I'm off the coast of
Africa which um I'm not an expert of
geography I'm pretty sure Romania is not
off the coast of Africa um also it says
it's in all these places so I can
guarantee you they are not so it's it's
not perfect
um yeah so CH by it's doing well just
not it's not perfect I I this is not
Romania I think let me check let me
check one more time
no that's in Spanish yeah this is H okay
um well if no one has any more Tech
questions I'll check to see if my Cali
Linux oh it's working it's working okay
I got my antenna to work
correctly all right let's see if I can
follow the tutorial of this no by
article here we go I'm going to try to
detect the thing the anybody was running
on my PC right so here we go I'm just
gonna like this here so you got to do
air NG check
kill all right click the Windows key
open the terminal you're not going to
see it I'm just going to tell you what
it says so of course cuz K is annoying
got to type PSE sudo of everything
control Fe type in my top secret
password okay it killed my Wi-Fi network
now I got to um do Min w n z and this
wi-fi adapt actually works this is the
alpha Wi-Fi
adapter um and oh I
got okay it ran it now I'm going to run
this and I'm GNA have to delete the mon
part of it because I don't have mod on
here I I really dislike how oh I gotta
run suit again I dislike how
less how whatever it call not as
detailed these hacking tutorials could
be so I ran it and it's pick up all the
Wi-Fi networks surround me all
right so I know what router I'm on I
just have to find the correct name of it
oh we got a wpa3 network in
here uh that is not us oh it's someone's
Ali we have an Ali nearby I need to go
if I had a bike I I
check it say there's a there's a Wi-Fi
network called Feds Watching interesting
and of course uh you can always look up
your BSS ID on wiggle
WiFi and find the
location I don't see our Network and I
know we're connected because you know I
wouldn't be able to talk to you guys if
we
weren't okay maybe I should go full
screen here you
go the problem is when I go full screen
on this VM it sometimes crashes and
turns black let see what the comments
think okay we went full screen let's see
if I can find our
network no no
no no I still don't see it okay I think
I know what a BSS ID is so if it doesn't
show up I can try again okay I just
going to cut this so control C and then
try it
again oh I saw it I saw it I saw it I
found our
Network okay so I I paused it and I
click control C and I have to do das d d
this all this
right I'm going to copy this and then
paste it into my browser because my
stupid computers Arrow not arrow keys
the minus keys don't work anymore I mean
come on so I got to paste this in right
it's channel so I'm going to check into
my
VM so your channel
is where did I go oh there we go okay
we're
Channel we Channel One Yes Channel One
gu I just have to delete that one right
there the desktop capture says BSS I
think okay you're not going to see me
type that in so stop sharing and you
just find that on this on the left hand
side the very left hand side of it so
I'm going to copy that in and there and
paste it in there and ESS ID is the name
of the network so we have AT&T so it's
AT&T something
um uh okay so I'm going to delete what
says no p network and put it there and
then command zero there
and copy
there and hopefully this works I don't
know if I should I at the quotation
marks oh I got to run Su though
okay and it's working against the
network right now what do this do oh
it's the authenticating oh dear oh no
am I still
live I'm not still I check my SS ID loog
out
um what is an SSD letter and an SSA
account like your Social Security a
social security deposit letter
um how do you probably an accident I'm
not sure how did you check
online did you was it secure
Wi-Fi and um sorry guys in the house if
the Wi-Fi wait so were you at your house
when you checked it or were you at like
some coffee
shop I think it's trying to capture
handshake it this has lost four packets
right now so I'm not sure if that's good
enough I'm G to stop this just in case I
don't want the stream to go
dead okay
[Music]
and oh okay it wasn't at home my
program I mean if it's deactivated they
that means if it was hacked then the
government probably shut it down because
they figured out it was hacked so you
probably just have to get it
reactivated um it you probably could
have been hacked but I I don't I I doubt
it um
yeah okay so I'm going to open a new
terminal and run
air air replay
NG against the
network oh I got to keep that command
going okay so I'm going to restart that
okay and while that's going on I'm going
to open a new to new
window
there
and run this command here against the
BSS
so BSS ID is the
same I think that three right there is
supposed to be a it's supposed to be
there
four it's supposed to be like your
channel they don't explain because I
guess they expect you to know which is
still annoying and then I got to change
the network name to that and then change
it to
okay
um you're
welcome okay so I'm in my second Window
Control shft Fe oops oops okay okay here
go let's try it what's a d
quote
Oh I didn't put the quotation marks
around on the way or something and I got
run that suud it's so annoying
okay
I think it
worked yeah we we lost 56 frames I mean
well it ended so we're going to keep
going um let me present my
screen and I think my phone also
identifies what it is doing and if this
doesn't work I'll just connect to the
network like a normal person and um
stoping hack into it and then see what's
running okay so what I have to do is
decrypt the pcap so use
this and then type in my Wi-Fi password
which you guys definitely cannot
see oh it was a much easier way of doing
this just scan with your better
cap
and just just search with better cap
right and go in and see what domains it
connects to so I can see that my Avast
is actually connecting to some sites
over HTTP it's kind of stupid like it's
a security thing and it connect the
stuff over hgp it's kind of funny if you
think about
it okay
okay so I'm putting the password in
which we would have gotten if we
intercepted and cracked it
but right now we're assuming we already
load up password copying of course you
got to use pseudo so I'm going
in hey it actually worked I can't
believe it actually worked total number
of P station seen total number of
packets read total packets
decrypted no packets have been decrypted
that's sad okay let's see what else
let's keep moving
on
yeah so there's
that hello and welcome back any
questions so unfortunately this doesn't
didn't work but I can show you what
would work and it would be better cap
[Music]
um which W so what you have to do is you
find a better
cap this is where that suin and I was
talking about would come in handy
because some tutorials are just really
bad sometimes they leave out stuff like
that like use full duplex
true so I got to I gotta reconnect the
internet somehow I'll just pull out the
cable and it back
in
okay let's
see let's see if it
connects okay so I'm not connected
that you have to be connected to your
network to do
this
so this may me go
down
make so I gotta find
my thing because I don't memorize all
the commands and also I think it has a
Dash in it and I don't have a dash on my
axle keyboard
anymore okay let's
see okay let's see
up
okay here we go this will put my thing
back
in okay now it's
up and it should connect and give me
internet access now and I should be able
to scan using better cap so let's go
back to our
tutorial what's a good computer game you
know that's a good question
I'm not really into gaming and anything
like
that um I I I don't game at all like I
literally just started yesterday um
there's there's Airline manager 4 which
is kind of like managing an Excel
spreadsheet and gets all
your your your your your planes to fly
and stuff it's not a flight simulator
and then I guess a Roblox game I don't
know jailbreak or whatever that's pretty
interesting but I mean that's it I don't
game I I do other stuff so I'm not
really
into it that much so I wouldn't know um
what a good computer game would be
um I like AI
programs what's your favorite computer
game like I have Roblox on here but the
the controls are awful and I have these
like stupid like tiny buttons like how
am I supposed to
use
these okay let's see am I connected no
oh come on work anyway what you would do
is this Dr is not working right now so
I'm going to restart
it
restart there we go all right so right
now it's restarting my C who is stuck
inside of it so I got okay I'm out um
what you do is you use better cap right
and you sniff the traffic right and I'd
see uh I type in my IP address and
what's to area let me look that up okay
anyway I would sniff the traffic and
everything and I would see what things
my anybody is connecting to and it
connects to fast surfos right I think
you can even see this in in glass wire
which of course would be local but I can
prove to you that it connects to surfos
and you find out hey look they connected
to Z security wow okay let's see
um now see my aast
antivirus
um
connected according
to I think at something it even has its
own firewall which is interesting here
here we have a traffic monitor so Google
Chrome is the most
trafficky think okay then followed by
some Windows host processes and stuff
grammar leag Zoho some more Microsoft
Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft and then a
vast okay and then we got you can
actually visualize the data in glass
wire and you can see
um so yeah vast is
pretty connects
connecting uh it connects it
twice at the bottom half of
it which isn't a lot of data but you can
see what it's running and then you can
find exploits for it or things that you
can bypass to run it let's see if my VM
set back up oh my vm's back
up so now I can run the commands oh my C
is stuck so sorry if I can't see any of
your chats okay there we go let's go
back and we are going to run this and
I'm going to tell you if thinks oh we
got to talk about Terraria and then we
got to talk about how I became myy ryel
at my
school okay so we gotta type this back
in sorry sorry sorry so what we got to
do is we got to say bettercap do if face
w l zero right right you got to find out
what what you on right but I'm on that
cuz I am on a wireless adapter at at
ethernet adapter connected Network so
control sh Fe type that in oh I gotta
use Pudo control I would use Pudo Su but
that means I have to use
a I have to use a thing a dash and I
don't have wait can you use no I don't
need a dash never mind okay and then
what you do is you'll say next show in
that show um lets you see all the things
on your network so I'm going to see like
12 13 something devices on here that are
currently connected to network and it
actually pops up here unfortunat which
is good I like inmap with some
reason
uh which for some reason can't put scan
this computer I don't know what's wrong
with it okay so net. show oh know it
just shows by Gateway and my network
adap and then
and say that on and that's going to find
all the devices and then you can put it
into a nice little table
right so it's finding all my devices
that are on the network and then you
have say set up spe for this prod to
which is good because apparently our
router has op SM protection which
doesn't make any sense because I it's a
cheap router from old time or whatever
right then say set op SPO Target I'm
going to type in my IP address but for
some reason it only it filters it
doesn't filter so that's said one 9
two okay there we go I typed typed it in
for some reason it it it only um it
doesn't filter so it does the entire
network so you got to be careful not
careful uh uh see like
uh you got to be um focused focused on
what you're doing because it will show
all the traffic from everything
including smart speakers so up spof on
okay and that gets annoying because then
you can't see anything and then set next
St local true and you should bookmark
these sites because sometimes they're
hard to find like maybe Google's
censoring them you know oh no connection
failed oh okay whatever right back and
then net sniff on and then we'll start
sniffing in in a few minutes I will see
all that beautiful fast traffic come on
let's sniff on okay it's on nothing's
happening right
now okay let's see what's going on let's
see I'm going to type in Samsung
okay I switch for Samsung we have oh I
got something I got something and see I
got all these things from my mom's
server uh looks like a fire stick and
whole bunch of other stuff like literal
nothing I filtered
for that's because it's all HTTP traffic
I'm not really getting muched of
anything okay I'm going to open a vast
I'm just going to like start clicking
around on it
explore messages
account it has a buil-in VPN that's
that's nice of them let's see I'm going
to click file shield no Emil Web Shield
open web shield turn it off 10 minutes
okay stop okay then I'm G to turn it
back on let's see I said ible generate
enough traffic right no I'm still not
intercepting anything this just a whole
bunch of do SUB
domains I think we missed something
hereo let's try another tutorial CU
sometimes these tutorials can be bad
let's see
Terraria
make up spoof on maybe I didn't touch
that
oh we got it we got it so we got our
nobite we got our nobite domain that it
is connected
to um and you can actually see that when
you load a website um it will load lots
of ads and like track so let's go to the
best tech website on the internet
tech.org
okay and I'm going to
check
hey hey hey look look look when I went
to my website it started loading up and
it said I connected to sweet.org uh
which is our analytic software aners
and.org which um we have that on the
website cookie yes
microsoft.com all right all right all
right okay um it didn't actually tell me
which website I went to which is kind of
weird like it's it's acting like I went
to Sweet tricks.com and and Genesis
which I didn't I just went to my own
website okay it said I connected to my
ad blocker Google hosted interest in
Genesis let's see I now let's click on a
link on the best tech website on the
planet here you go let's go to our Zoom
I link here and on the
terminal uh oh it connected to Twitter
which is because it is piped into that
onto that post there okay let's actually
go to Sweet Trix maybe my website just
too C you know
um okay so I went to sweetx via Google
it's still connecting to ad block all
right I'm going to open a vast let's
see I'm going to run a
scan okay right now it's running a scan
and we got it guys it connected to https
do sheeper analytics of asked okay
because I started running a scan so um
if you use your antivirus while summon
scanning it will connect look we got
avcd
n.net we got shepherd. avast.com um of
course we're going to look at all these
links here
um and then of course we connected to
Glass wire so let's see what happens
here oh oh we got some HTTP traffic
that's right HTTP traffic from a vast a
security newspaper right there we got
which which is stupid stupid because um
I could intercept the traffic and modify
it somehow I don't know how but it's
something that you can do and this is
our Avast link that we got here
avast.com
nc. um so
if it is an insecure website I mean
imagine that an insecure website from an
an anti company it says for network
connectivity check right but what if
what if someone would have hacked his
website and
scan it for vulnerabilities in fact you
can go into zoomi and click that
in and uh put a beef exploit
into yeah nothing there
okay okay
I'm going to Sweet
tricks and while we're doing that let's
just
for Sweet tricks.com let's see what we
loaded oh whoa whoa what is this what
loaded
here I went to another HTTP
site I don't remember that but
okay right let's
see sweet Trix is loading I'm going to
reload just in case we missed
it not seeing anything
here but I'm going to see how to
redirect traffic HTTP traffic with
better okay here's Terraria anyway it's
out control game okay how
to oh did you know that go conate images
now
better generate
HTTP so I'm going to try to intercept
the HTP traffic from a vast antivirus
and
um and inject it with something else
like say the tech word work and when it
goes to that
it's probably going to like change or
something right so here we
go and this is actually hard because it
it doesn't it doesn't redirect anything
and see here you don't really get much
you get just one video which I tried and
didn't work and than that but the guy is
talking and I can barely understand him
um oh he can't see so here we go this
this is just an easy search result right
here right this is be easy be on website
right you got this video that doesn't
work for me because it's like four years
old and this guy could build understand
them and this this is just
capturing hey I just noticed that with
this search result here I got the normal
searches then you have to click that
more button there we
go we got a Reddit thing
here we didn't get
anything and then DNS boing which is
like really
hard so yeah there that so be safe on
the
internet um if anyone has any questions
I'll be here for the see till
135 and then we'll go
off unless of course you have a question
then we
answer
oh we got to talk about how I was like
Mo so like set up this fake case right
put some notes into a locker made a
video I'm actually GNA post the video
onto YouTube it is a sped up version of
God is in control and last one overl on
top of your tit a bunch of random memes
from
shotcut so
yeah
TR okay let's see any
questions nope okay we got like 30
seconds
left
all right God bless Tech talk to you
later and God
bless</pre>
